This is just a quick lowdown of

with. If you are looking for a

Game Menus, then refer to the
relevant section not too far
down from here.

-------------------
Menu and Game Modes
-------------------

From the Main Menu, you are
shown a series of options. This
section will inform you of what
each part contains and a quick
explanation of that mode.

----------
Grand Prix
----------

Located in the Single Player
menu, this is the main mode of
the game. Here you race in cups
in differing CC classes, where
you can unlock more characters
and carts, and generally have a
good go at the courses. There
are four CC classes - 50CC,
100CC, 150CC and 150CC Mirror
(you have to unlock this) and
within these are 8 Cups, each
with four courses to race in.
With these four courses you are
awarded points according to the
position you come in.

1st - 10 Points
2nd - 8 Points
3rd - 6 Points
4th - 4 Points
5th - 3 Points
6th - 2 Points
7th - 1 Point
8th - 0 Points

After the four races your points
are totted up and if you get the
most points you get awarded
Gold. Hurrah! You also get a
rank based on your performance.
This rank goes from E to ***,
and this is mostly dependant on
time. Although you may have
heard other things, or think the
ranking is like it was in Mario
Kart Super Circuit on the GBA
then it's wrong; it's *mostly*
based on time. As you as you
finish a good while in front
with a great time on each
course, without smashing into a
lot of items or off cliffs then
you should get a *** ranking.
You can even use items, but I
assume not *loads*. It helps if
you can snake a little too.


-----------
Time Trails
-----------

Here you can just race on the
course of your choice, practice
up and set a best time. You get
just one mushroom as far as
items go, so use it wisely. On
the touch screen map you can see
what route you take thanks to
sets of arrows, with blue
showing a normal route, yellow
showing drift, red showing a
drifting boost and a mushroom
symbol for you-know-what. You
save ghosts here so you can race
yourself again later, and even
compete against Staff Ghosts
(see the Unlockables section
toward the end of the guide to
see more on this).


---Vs.
---

This is basically where you can
make a custom race between you
and the computer. You can set
things like CC Class, Opponent
difficulty, Courses, Rules (like
upto X amount of Wins, Points or
just a free game) and Teams
(which is quite interesting. Of
course the Multiplayer mode, you
face your friends instead.


------
Battle
------

Here you face off against other
karts in a battle like arena,
playing one or two games. For
the first time in a Mario Kart
game you can now practice
against the computer, a welcome
move. The two modes are...

Balloon Battle - Use Items to
pop your opponents balloons
until they are all
    gone! Each kart has up to fi
    blown up at any one time (us
    more up) and fight away!
Shine Runners - From Mario Kart:
Double Dash!! This is where you
collect as
    many shines as possible. Onc
    another will regenerate else
    fight others for them. If yo
    out so put up a good fight a
    others!


--------
Missions
--------

These are short missions where
you have to perform tasks before
the time limit is over. This
includes collecting coins,
driving through gates,
collecting Item Boxes and more.
There is also a boss stage at
the end of each mission set. In
each level are 8 missions and a
Boss Stage, with a total of 7
levels (level 7 has to be
unlocked by getting at least a *
ranking on all the other
missions).


------------------------
Nintendo WiFi Connection
------------------------

Online! Yes! To play online you
need a wireless (or WiFi)
internet signal. This could be
at home, work, school, McDonalds
etc. or you can use a Nintendo
WiFi USB Connector (check
online, such as at Amazon for
this). Before you can play you
need to connect and configure
your signal. Go into Settings
and then the Connection set up.
Where you can add a Connection
(upto 3) as well as a simple way
to connect to a USB Connector.
DO NOT EMAIL ME ABOUT CONNECTION
HELP. I DO NOT KNOW. I heard
that shutting down your firewall
may make connections work
though. If you are having
trouble them contact the
Nintendo WiFi website or the
GameFAQs Mario Kart DS message
boards.

Once you get a connection
configured, you are ready to
race! You have Friends, Rivals,
Continental and WorldWide. Each
does what it says on the tin
really. You need Friends
searching for them to connect
and you need to ensure that you
have their code and they have
yours so you can play. Rivals
pits you against those of
similar skills. Continental is
where you play against those
from your Continent, and
WorldWide allows you to play
anyone from around the world.

To add Friends and send out a
Friend Code, first get a
connection set up and play
online, then a friend code is
generated for you. Go in to the
Friend Code section in the menu
to check yours; here is also
where you add other peoples. As
said above to play another gamer
you need to add each other to
your Friends lists in order to
play each other.

Some notes about online play.
There is no chat; no rooms or
mic talk. You cannot add
contacts online, so you have to
know that person in real life or
on the internet before you can
play them. You cannot dangle
items during a race and
sometimes lag will occur (they
move around quickly and
erratically during a race).
People may disconnect (if they
do, they receive a loss but you
don't get a win). Only up to 4
people can play online at once,
and worst of all only 20 of the
32 courses are playable online.

But aside from those 'notes'
Online game is real good fun and
worth trying at least once. If
you haven't got a wireless
network at home or near you then
I would say that it's worth
investing in a USB Connector
from a website.


-------
Records
-------

This is where you view your
times and records thus far. On
the top screen on the main menu
are your records against other
people, either in multiplayer
racing, battle, or online. There
are also sub-sections such as
Grand Prix (see the times and
rankings), Time Trails (best
times) and Friends (your records
against friends, both online and
off).


-------
Options
-------

There are two sections in here;
Settings and Edit. In Settings
you can change the sound type
and Locate Friend option (when
online if a friend is searching
for opponents you'll get a
notice when playing). Edit is
where you edit your emblem,
which will appear on your kart
in all modes including online.
Use the stylus to create your
own custom design. Pretty cool,
eh? There is a pretty cool
website where you can select an
image on your computer and get
it converted in to an emblem for
you to trace into Edit mode.

------------------
Driving Techniques
------------------

Rocket Start
------------
This performs a boost as the
race starts, very handy for
getting the advantage straight
away. To do it, at the opening
count down (3, 2, 1, GO!) press
and hold A when 2 is fading
away. If done right, you'll
boost away. Takes a bit of
practice but once you've got it
it's an invaluable technique.

Drift
-----
You can drift by holding down
the R button when going around
corners. It allows you to take
sharper corners without loss of
speed, so is good for many of
the game's course. To start it,
turn and press R to set the
direction, and you can also
adjust the direction of the
drift slightly by using the
d-pad as you go anyway.

Mini-Turbo
----------
This gives you a boost after
drifting. To do it, get into a
drift and tap left and right on
the d-pad to change the colour
of the sparks from your kart. It
should turn blue, then red if
you keep going. Once it goes red
releasing R will give you a
mini-turbo. The level of boost
will differ depending on the
kart, but it does give you a
worth while boost, so mastering
this will give you the
advantage. To pull off faster
boosts, then place the ball of
your thumb in the middle of the
d-pad so all is required is
slight lateral movement left and
right. This takes a while to get
used to and may start to hurt
after a few races, but it
enables you to pull off mini-
turbo again and again.

Snaking
-------
This is a very advanced
technique, where you perform
mini-turbo over and over again
in a snake like fashion. So say
you are on a straight, and you
are on the left; drift to the
right, and boost ahead so you're
on the right. Now drift to the
left and boost so you end up on
the left. Keep repeating this to
create a snake like movement
down the track, giving you a
huge advantage if done
correctly. As said it is very
advanced and so takes a lot of
practice to pull off, especially
as you got to pull off mini-
turbos very fast (use the method
I described above, with placing
the ball of your thumb on the
d-pad so less movement is
required). Snaking is what all
the pro's use and you'll need to
be able to pull it off to some
degree if you want to make it
online. Use Time Trial as a
place of practice!

Throwing Items
--------------
When you are using certain
items, such as shells and
bananas, you can throw them in
front or behind you by pressing
up and down respectively. You
can launch green and red shells
behind you and throw Bob-Ombs,
Fake Item Boxes and Bananas
ahead of you.

Dangling Items
--------------
You can drag certain items
behind you, by holding the L
button. This enables you to
block attacks from behind, such
as those pesky red shells, and
to time your item drops more
effectively. You can drag
bananas, green shells, red
shells, Fake Item Boxes and Bob-
Ombs.

Slipstreaming
-------------
By following the car in front on
a straight you can slipstream
and increase you speed. As they
are absorbing the wind they
leave a tail of less resistant
air in their wake, which allows
you to move in a slightly faster
manner. You can tell if you are
doing this as blue lines will
appear on your screen, and if
done long enough you can get a
boost which will allow you to
over take. Very handy if you
need to overtake others. However
watch out in case they fire a
shell or drop a banana.

Turning on the spot
-------------------
You can turn on the spot by
holding accelerate and brake
together (A and B) and turning
left and right. This is very
handy if you are driving the
wrong way, or for the Missions.

Recovering after falling off the
track
--------------------------------
If you just fell off the track
and are being lifted back on,
you can recover quicker by
pressing accelerate JUST AS you
touch the ground again to
receive a boost. Takes some
practice, but worth it even if
you are an experienced racer;
you never know when some heavier
kart is gonna knock you off the
track.


--------------------------------
Driving and Item Tips and
Tactics
--------------------------------

Here are some additional item
and driving tips that might come
in handy. Feel free to submit
any of your own!

• Coming off the track or
  hitting a wall slows you down
  to a literal crawl. So don't
  do it.
• If you are gonna cut out some
  of the track, subsidize the
  slowdown with a drifting mini-
  boost or better
• Placing fake item boxes or
  bananas by real item boxes
  should block them from view of
  your opponents, meanin
  Although the CPU might spot th
  it'll work better, unless they
  many do I'm afraid). It's also
  item with another by dropping
  in front.
• If you are in first place,
  then it's a good idea to drag
  an item behind you (or have a
  draggable item with shells and
  what not. It's a pa item at
  the last minute so try can't
  do this online but I'm * a
  shell hits you so it destroy
• If you are neck and neck with
  an opponent and coming up to
  item boxes, drop back slightly
  so you are in first place you
  cannot pick you one so you can
  take them o is incredibly
  annoying and che on the final
  lap.
• Again like the above, if you
  are in a very close race then
  drop back a few positions and
  grab an item box proximity,
  you could get somet And who
  wouldn't want that, eh
• If you are gonna use a red or
  blue shell then wait for them
  to get a slight lead,
  otherwise the red shell blue
  shell likewise and even w (if
  they are in first anyway).
• If you have several (hopefully
  red) shells, then you can
  incapacitate a kart ahead.
  Fire one to spin t them (where
  they've hardly had started
  going again proper, yo

 2.03. Items
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Pick up an item box in a race
and you'll get an item. But do
you know how to use it properly
and to it's full advantages? If
not, read on... Note that I have
put How to Use and Defending
Against. The How to use part is
tips on how you can use it,
while the other is what
precautions you can take in
order to avoid or minimize the
impacts of the said item if
others have it. Remember than
you can often see what item an
opponent has either visually and
by their character icon on the
bottom screen. There is also a
position received section, which
will tell you what position(s)
you have to be in to get the
item - thanks to Mystic Aurora
for supplying this information!

banana skin on to the track.
When a

banana on the track, common

as a single banana (see above)
but
   with three. However unlike tr

normal bananas, avoid driving
over them. If
     you see another player with
     hanging around behind them

Triple Red / Green Shells

green shells that rotate around

shell defense see the red and

     avoid touching them for a s

     shells of your own as that'
     as well let them fire them 
         for attacking.

Spiny Blue Shell
----------------
Position Received - 4th-8th How
to use - Fire it with the L
button and it'll fly off to
first place and
   explode there, causing an exp

     are really luckily, the she
     can also avoid getting hit 
     but otherwise as said most 
     hit, so don't get too annoy

Fake Item

use - Press L to drop a fake
item on the track. When rival
karts drive
   in to it they'll spin out. So

Defending Against - You can spot
a fake item box via several
ways. Firstly,
     the ? is upside down and th
     not bound to notice this in
     ways. The map will show if 
     real ones are green boxes, 
     players especially the CPU 
     on the track, so if you see
     normal item box placements 
     one.

Mushroom
--------
Position Received - 2nd-4th How
to use - Press L to boost your
karts speed for a second or two.
This is
   really handy for gaining a fe
   skipping sections of the trac
   or certain shortcuts better. 
   stop once you've used the boo
   were going to go into a banan

Defending Against - Not a lot
you can do here. I guess you
could time a ghost
     to steal their mushroom, bu
     'em be.


---------------
Triple Mushroom
---------------
Position Received - 2nd-4th How
to use - This is the same as a
normal Mushroom, expect you have
three.
   Predictable, eh? Remember to 
   track and to take full advant
   a very important point is to 
   there is a great shortcut you
   mushroom, so it makes far mor
   every lap than to use them on
Defending Against - Once again
you can't really defend or stop
other karts from
        using mushrooms.

Characters
----------

In Mario Kart DS there are 8
default characters, and 4
unlockable ones (note that if
you don't want to know who they
are, then it's best advised that
you skip this section). While
each one is different
cosmetically, they all have
different weight affiliations
which impacts on their stats and
their racing styles. Here is
each character, their weight
class, and what impact they have
on their weight. Thanks to
Mystic Aurora for this
information.

Light - Peach (Weight - 11)
   Yoshi        (Weight - 14)
   Toad         (Weight - 17)
   Daisy*       (Weight - 8)
   Dry Bones*   (Weight - 20)
Medium - Mario (Weight - None)
  Luigi        (Weight - None)
   Waluigi*     (Weight + 2)
Heavy - Donkey Kong (Weight + 8)
   Bowser       (Weight + 17)
   Wario        (Weight + 10)

Each character has up to three
unique karts, however you can
later unlock others karts for
that character to use, which are
from the other racers (up to 7
and later, every other kart in
the game). This section outlines
the stats for each kart in the
game for each character. Thanks
to Mystic Aurora for suppling
the stats for each kart!

================================
        ---------------
          4. MISSIONS
        ---------------
================================

These are short missions where
you have to perform tasks before
the time limit is over. This
includes collecting coins,
driving through gates,
destroying Item Boxes and more.
There is also a boss stage at
the end of each mission set. In
each level are 8 missions and a
Boss Stage, with a total of 7
levels (level 7 has to be
unlocked by getting at least a *
ranking on all the other
missions).


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 4.01. Level 1
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-----------
Mission 1-1
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 5
numbered gates in order!

The first mission takes place on
8-Figure Circuit, where you'll
go round the first corner going
through gates. There are
mushrooms to drive in to before
each one, which will increase
your speed. Overall very easy.
To get a higher rank, then do a
boost start, use all the
mushrooms and perform mini-
boosts between some of the
gates.


-----------
Mission 1-2
-----------

Objective - Collect all 15
coins!

Drive onward and collect the
first few coins, and drift into
the coins and release the drift
to collect all the rest. Just
ensure that you drive past them
first time and you should get a
high rank.


-----------
Mission 1-3
-----------

Objective - Destroy all 10 item
boxes!

All the boxes here are located
on the left side of the track.
Each box contains a mushroom, so
as soon as you get it tap L to
stop the item selector and L
again to use it toward the next
box. However half way through
use them strategically, so that
you can boost when not going
over the ground boosters.


-----------
Mission 1-4
-----------

Objective - Get the star and use
it to hit 5 Cheep Cheeps!

Quite a tough mission, use the
boxes for stars and then ram in
to each of the Cheep Cheeps on
the beach. The thing is when you
approach them they jump away, so
you'll need to approach them
slowly and ram into them that
way. Take it nice and easy,
you'll have enough time. If you
do it first time with one star,
you'll manage a very high rank.


-----------
Mission 1-5
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 6
numbered gates in order!

Drive straight onward through
the first gate, then drift left
and through the second and onto
the third. Drift through the
four and left, onward to five
and finally drift left to the
sixth. If you manage mini-boosts
as you drift then you'll get a
high rank.


-----------
Mission 1-6
-----------

Objective - Drive out of the
mansion... backward!

As you'll be driving backward
out of the mansion, you'll be
needing the B button (not A) for
reverse, and that left turns you
right and right turns you left,
okay? This shouldn't be too
hard, head down the ramp, around
the corner, right as you exit
(exit a bit wide to avoid the
table against the wall), around
the centre table and out the
tunnel beyond to finish. To get
higher ranks stick close to the
corners.


-----------
Mission 1-7
-----------

Objective - Collect all 20
coins!

Drive onward and grab the item
box; triple mushrooms and head
onward. Use two before the
corner, and drift around it. Use
the third mushroom through the
centre of the holes and collect
the last few lines of coins.
Mini-boost round the corners to
get faster and times, and so
higher ranks.


-----------
Mission 1-8
-----------

Objective - Perform 4 power-
slide turbo boosts in 1 lap!

To turbo boost, drift (R and a
direction) and alternate between
left and right until the sparks
turn blue, then red. Stop
drifting (let go of R) to boost!
As there are five corners on
this track and the first corner
is pretty much straight away,
you'll have to perform boosts on
the remaining corners. Drift on
the inside of the pipe corner to
avoid the pipes, drift early for
the next tight turn and the last
two are easy enough.


----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Use Mushrooms to
crash into the Big Bully and
knock him off the
   stage!

Very easy this boss; don't turbo
start as he'll ram you straight
away and if you do you'll fly
back even more. So start
normally and accept the ram,
drive round him and collect the
item box for triple mushrooms.
Turn round and use the mushrooms
to knock him off the stage (he
should be right at the edge now)
and you'll bag an easy three
star rank.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 4.02. Level 2
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-----------
Mission 2-1
-----------

Objective - Crash into all 10
wooden crates and destroy every
one!

Perform a starting boost and
take out the first three crates.
Now ahead is the dock area;
smash into the top one, go down
the ramp and into the next one
at the corner, and finally the
one at the end of the peer. Now
turn around on the spot (A and B
together plus a direction) and
head back up the ramp and back
on to the street, taking a hard
right. Drive in to the remaining
boxes ahead, drift around the
bridge, right and into the final
wooden box by the grassy area.
Remember to have a decent speed
before hitting the box,
otherwise it won't smash. If you
manage to mini-boost when
drifting and turn on the spot
you should attain high ranks.


-----------
Mission 2-2
-----------

Objective - Collect all 10
coins!

Reverse and grab the coin
behind, then proceed onward and
collect the rest. If you drift
round the corner, and perform a
mini-boost if you can, you can
easily get a three star rank
here.


-----------
Mission 2-3
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 5
numbered gates in order!

Drift on to the bridge and
through the first numbered gate,
drift right and straight ahead
to take advantage of the
shortcut to use the mushroom and
to head through the second gate.
Drift right and through the
third gate on the end of the
corner, move right slightly and
when you go over the next
mushroom and through the forth
gate hold left to make the
corner. For the fifth gate there
are two mushrooms before it; as
Donkey Kong has poor handling
you'll need to hold right a fair
amount to make sure you get
through the gate with the
mushrooms. If you mini-boost
when drifting the first few
corners and take advantage of
all the mushrooms you'll get a
high rank!


-----------
Mission 2-4
-----------

Objective - Destroy all 5 item
boxes!

Item boxes will race down the
track, and you'll have to chase
and drive into them to destroy
them. Remember that each
contains a mushroom, so make
sure you use it before you grab
the next one so it isn't a
waste. It's fairly easy unless
you are looking for a high rank,
in which case do the following.
Perform a turbo start and drive
slightly left to catch the first
as it exits the first corner,
and use the mushroom to get the
second as it exits the second
corner. Mushroom up the path to
catch up with the next as you
enter the mansion, and again to
get the next on the ramp. Use
the mushroom to catch the fifth
and final box as it takes the
ramp U-turn wide (take it as
it's between corners) and you
should get a starred rank.


-----------
Mission 2-5
-----------

Objective - Collect all 20
coins!

A very easy mission, simply
drive round the corner
collecting the coins, take the
booster jump *straight on* (very
important to catch those mid air
coins) and collect the remaining
few. You can attain a three star
rank even without mini-boosting.


-----------
Mission 2-6
-----------

Objective - Use Bob-ombs to
destroy all 5 Pokeys!

Use Bob-Ombs in the item boxes
to throw at the Pikeys. They
will explode on impact,
otherwise if they miss or are
dropped they explode after about
5 seconds and as long as the
Pokey is caught in the blast
radius then it'll be destroyed.
The fastest way is as follows -
boost start and grab the far
right item box, and chuck it at
the right Pokey. Reverse over
the same item box and take out
the right one. Do the same with
the two ahead, and grab another
for the fifth and chuck it at
him to take a high rank.


-----------
Mission 2-7
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 10
numbered gates in order!

Head onward, through the first
gate and over the boost. Now go
on to the left side of the road
(the opposite side) and drive
through the next gate. Grab an
item box and drive on the right
for the third gate. Use the
mushroom from the item box and
to the corner for the forth
gate, and on to the boosts on
the track side for the fifth.
Continue back on the straight
and head through the sixth gate
ahead, and the seventh and
eighth on the left side, the
ninth toward the corner and the
tenth and final gate is on top
of the corner (on the higher
path next to the boosters). For
the highest ranks try snaking,
which is mini-boosting over and
over.


-----------
Mission 2-8
-----------

Objective - Perform 6 power-
slide turbo boosts iin 3 laps!

You have three laps on Baby Park
to do this, which is one per
corner. Start out wide and drift
in close, then let go as you
leave the corner. If you miss
one you can do one on one of the
straights or two on one corner
if you can manage it, but I
would say restart otherwise. For
higher ranks, use the stars in
the item boxes to achieve faster
times.


----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Hit the Eyerok's
eyeball 3 times with shells!

You face two stone hands with
eyes on each palm; fire a shell
when an eye is open to hit it.
Check on your map to see when
the eyes are open or closed.
Here is a walkthrough. Turbo
start and bomb through the
middle of them and collect the
end item box for the first
shell. Now straight away turn
around and take out the hand
ahead for one hit. Carry on
driving, collect the next item
box and turn around. Drive right
a little, and wait for the far
hand to unclench and move right,
where the eye will open. Fire
the shell for the second shot.
Now collect the item box to the
right and turn around. At this
point the hands will clench and
together will move left and back
right again; wait where you are,
and when they return they will
unclench and turn around and the
eye will face you. Fire for the
third hit and if you managed it
quick enough, three stars will
be yours.

Mission 3-1
-----------

Objective - Destroy all 5 item
boxes!

Set in the table on Waluigi's
Pinball course, you have to
chase and collect all five
boxes. The fastest route is this
- turbo start and go just left
of the above bumper, where a box
will come in from the left. Two
will then come the right in to
you (you may have to move right
slightly for this third box),
then drive onward for the one
moving right against the
barrier, and now the fifth will
arrive here a few seconds later
- look at the map and move the
kart so it goes in to you
(reverse). Done in about 7
seconds, that's a three star
ranking! If you don't understand
the order and position of that
walkthrough, check the below

-----------
Mission 3-2
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 5
numbered gates in order...
backward!

Fairly easy, as long as you
remember that B is to reverse
and the directions too are
reversed. Go through the first
gate, and then left down the
side street. The gates are on a
loop, so head straight down the
stairs, round and up the ramps
the other side to the fifth gate
to finish.


-----------
Mission 3-3
-----------

Objective - Collect all 15 coins
while avoiding the Chain Chomp!

A very easy mission to complete;
there is a line of coins going
round a Chain Chomp. As long as
you just collect the coins the
Chomp won't even bother you. Tap
the acceleration as you are
turning to ensure that you don't
miss any coins.


-----------
Mission 3-4
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Yoshi!

You have to race Yoshi to the
finish on Yoshi Falls. You'll
have to track the right side of
the track for the first section
(the other side is closed off)
so use any items you collect and
/ or drift and mini-boost
through the water. Then move on
to the left and use the booster
pads to the finish. You
shouldn't have to worry about
Yoshi, as he is a complete slow
poke here. If you want higher
ranking then use the items you
receive and perform mini- boosts
or snake where you can.


-----------
Mission 3-5
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 8
numbered gates in order!

Drive straight on though the
first gate and straight on to
the pipe and into gate two. Go
round the corner to gate three,
and right again through four and
enter the pipe. You'll appear on
the ground again and through
five, onward past the ramp,
drift through six, up the ramp
to seven and drive off the edge
back in to the central area
where the eighth and final gate
resides. To get higher ranks
mini-boost when turning.


-----------
Mission 3-6
-----------

Objective - Hit Monty Moles with
shells 5 times!

You have three item boxes ahead
of you, with seven holes in
front of them with Moles popping
out. They will stick their head
out then jump out fully about
half a second after. The key is
to fire a shell just as you see
their head pop out. So get a
line between a item box and a
hole, then get a shell and sit
about halfway between the two.
As soon as you see the head pop
out, fire the shell and reverse
back, grab a shell and go back
to the middle. If you were quick
enough with the shell it should
have hit him, and you then
repeat this over and over. This
is the quickest method. Other
methods include sitting in front
of a hole and dangle the shell
behind you (which should earn
you at least a A or one star
rank) or to line up with two
holes in front of you and to sit
on an item box and keep tapping
the L button so that as the
boxes regenerate you'll fire a
shell (but you'll be lucky to
pass using this). So use the
first method and you can get a
high ranking with that with
enough practice.


-----------
Mission 3-7
-----------

Objective - Perform 10 power-
slide turbo boosts in 1 lap!

Shroom Ridge this time. There
are more than 10 corners here (I
think) so as long as you drift
and boost on pretty much every
corner you should make it.
Remember to stay on the left
lane so you are going with the
traffic (especially on blind
corners) such on the second and
third corners a lorry comes
round on the right lane that
could take you out. The higher
ranks requires boosts on every
corner and to avoid touching the
edges or any vehicles.


-----------
Mission 3-8
-----------

Objective - Collect all 20
coins! You have to navigate
through a series of rooms to
collect all 20 coins. However as
rooms and routes are blocked off
you have to get them in a
certain order - also banana
skins block your path in places,
where hitting one will cause you
to lose all of your coins. If
this happens then restart.

Anyway a walkthrough. Accelerate
onward for coin (1), through to
the next room and left to
collect the second (2). Head
outside and round to the next
room with the next in the
doorway (3) and turn right and
collect the coin by the barrier
(4). Turn around, through the
room and head right outside for
a coin (5) and drive around the
banana skin in to the room and
collect the coin (6) as you head
in to the next room. Collect the
coin here (7) then go left and
outside to the walkway. Grab the
coin at the corner (8) and go
right and onward to a banana and
coin (9). Turn right and around
the central block of barriers
for coins (10) and (11) and exit
the same way you came in. Drive
on the left for coin (12) and
then right for coin (13), round
the corner and right into the
room. Collect the lone coin in
this room (14) and travel around
the edges of the room for coins
(15-20) to finish.

Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Goomboss!

You have to race Goombass, a
giant Goomba around three laps
of Baby Park. Basically race
like you would normally do and
drift and mini-boost round each
corner. Goomboss will nudge you
out of the way some times but
keep going, and dodge the
Goomba's he generates. Each lap
at the finish he grows bigger
and stronger, but drive around
him as he does this and keep
going as normal. He drops
mushrooms around the track too
so use those where you can, but
it isn't too hard to finish
first.

-----------
Mission 4-1
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Donkey Kong!

Here you race Donkey Kong on
this own turf - DK Pass -
backward! Kinda strange but its
still pretty easy to win. Drift
on the inside of the first
corner to avoid the snowmen, you
can still grab an item box just
after booster, and also go up
the side ledge and grab the
triple mushroom item box to gain
a real advantage and you'll do
this easily. If you perform
mini-boosts while drifting as
well, you'll bag a high rank
with no problem.


-----------
Mission 4-2
-----------

Objective - Blast 20 crabs!

Its remarkably easy to get a
three star rank here. Use the
item boxes on this central
island and take out the
surrounding crabs. You have
either triple green shells,
single green shells or Bob-Ombs.
With triple shells you can drive
into crabs to take them out, and
Bob-Ombs to throw or lay near a
group of them. They will advance
on the island after a short
while making them easier to take
out. As long as you finish by
the 1 minute mark you'll get a
high rank.


-----------
Mission 4-3
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before the red car!

Although the red car has a fair
lead, it's easy to over take him
after a few corners and bomb it
to the finish. Drift round
corners, use the item boxes
(should be mushrooms) and stick
on the left side of the road to
avoid on coming traffic and you
should get a decent rank no
problem.


-----------
Mission 4-4
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 7
numbered gates in order!

Proceed through the first gate
and drift right and grab an item
box - you should get a mushroom
or three. Use these through gate
two and through the shortcut to
the left of the pyramid, through
the S bend (gate three) and the
gate before the bump (gate
four). On this bumpy straight
collect another three mushrooms
from the item boxes, and begin
using them after the next gate
over the S-bend for the last few
gates.


-----------
Mission 4-5
-----------

Objective - Collect all 15
coins. If you get squished by a
Thwomp, you fail!

GET A STARTING TURBO and race
straight on through the first
line of coins. You'll make it
easily. Now quickly turn around
and start driving down the
second line as the line of
Thwomps have just smashed down.
You should complete it just in
time, with a starred rank.


-----------
Mission 4-6
-----------

Objective - Break all 10 item
boxes while avoiding the Fake
Items!

Taking place on Choco Mountain,
you have to drive through lines
of item boxes; each line has
only one real box, the others
are fake. To spot the difference
remember that on the touch
screen map the real ones are
green and the fake are red, and
that the fake ones don't rotate
in their appearance. Also
remember to use the mushroom you
get from each box to get to the
next line quicker.


-----------
Mission 4-7
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 10
gates!

Set on the table of Waluigi
Pinball, there are ten gates but
you can take in any order. I
find the fastest route is to
drive ahead, then take a hard
right and head round the
flippers for another two, then
continue round this red path to
the top and back down in a
figure of eight pattern. This
should net you a high rank.


-----------
Mission 4-8
-----------

Objective - Perform 9 power-
slide turbo booosts in 1 lap!

Luigi Circuit (GBA) for this
one. As this track thankfully
has plenty of wide U-Turns
(about 9-10) then this shouldn't
be too hard. Remember to avoid
the puddles and not to drift in
that snaky section before the
final two corners. There are no
shortcuts on this track either,
so just stick to the road and
mini-boost away.


----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Collect 50 coins
while avoiding King Boo!

Here you have to collect 50
coins located around the lava
pits around the edges of the
arena. However King Boo will now
and again attack you from behind
and take 10 coins and make all
the others disappear, meaning
you have to chase him down,
nudge in to him and once again
to get the coins back and to
continue your hunt. Drift around
the lava pits when collecting
the coins if you can, and ensure
that when you are collecting
that you get them all as it's a
real pain to go back collect a
coin or two again. It's quite a
tough battle and it's very hard
to get high ranks, but keep at
it.

-----------
Mission 5-1
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before the stray Chain Chomp!

You play as Peach in Peach
Gardens. Like the red car
mission the Chain Chomp has a
head start but you can easily
come back. Drift round left
collecting an item box as you
go, which will contain triple
mushrooms. Now instead of
driving round the next two
flower beds, use a mushroom
through them (for the first
boost and drive to the right of
the arrow) and the rest should
be plain sailing. For higher
ranks remember to drift and
mini-boost on corners where you
can.


-----------
Mission 5-2
-----------

Objective - Drive backward and
collect 15 coins! If you hit a
snowman, you
   fail!

Yawn, this is ruthlessly easy.
Remember that you use B to
reverse and the directions too
are reversed, and go round the
central statue collecting the
coins. If you want high ranks,
then just clip the edges of the
coins (so less turning is
involved) and to turn a little
early.


-----------
Mission 5-3
-----------

Objective - Destroy all 5 item
boxes!

There is great method to do this
easily, and with a three star
ranking. Start with a turbo
start and turn left so the boxes
are moving with you on the
right. Now as the boxes come in
from the deep, intercept the
first front box as soon as you
can and then stop dead so the
others run in to you. This may
take a few attempts to do, but
its the simplest way.


-----------
Mission 5-4
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 10
numbered gates in order!

This is essentially a lap of
Bowser Castle 2 (GBA) with gates
throughout. Drive through the
first gate and right round in to
the booster pad, in to gate two.
Drive on to the corner and drift
around through in to gate three
and round the Thomp. Turn and
drift early to the left to catch
the small booster on the far
left, and cross between the pits
through gate four (not touching
the booster jumps) and turn
early to take advantage of the
booster pad on the far right.
Drift round the corner to the
next section. Head straight on
over the jump boosts for the
next gate then stick to the
right for gate six. Drift right
round the corner and stick left
for gate seven, then pull left
for the booster pads to propel
you to the far end. Use the left
jump boost for gate eight, drift
early and through gate nine and
drive straight on to gate ten
(you may have to drive round the
Thomps though).


-----------
Mission 5-5
-----------

Objective - Complete 1 lap in
the opposite direction within
the time limit!

This is a reverse lap of NGC
Mushroom Bridge. Remember you DO
NOT reverse throughout the
track, it's just the track that
is reversed! Anyway you are
forced on the right side due to
the barriers, so wieve through
the traffic and collect the
moving item box for a mushroom.
Through the tunnel grab an item
box for another mushroom; this
can be used for the shortcut as
you exit. Turn left up the hill
and use a mushroom (and hold
right as you do so) and use
another mushroom on the ground.
Proceed through the tunnel and
finish. If you want higher
ranks, remember to drift and
mini-boost the tunnels and
turns.


-----------
Mission 5-6
-----------

Objective - Collect all 18
coins!

Drive onward and collect the two
coins around the coin, then turn
right into a line of three
coins. Drive through this and up
the booster in the centre to
collect one of the coins in the
air. The other side do the same
again; collect the two coins
round the cone, turn right
through the three coins and
collect another coin in the air.
And again when you land, round
the cone and up the centre. As
long as you collect all the
coins first time (especially all
those in the air) you should
attain a high ranking here.


-----------
Mission 5-7
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 8
numbered gates in order!

Once again, you drive up the
reversed DS Pass, but this time
through gates! Drive straight on
and through the first numbered
gate, then drift left through
two and onward through three.
Drive straight on (the snowballs
won't touch you) and over the
hump. Proceed onward through
four, go straight to five (a
snowball pops round this corner
so as long as you aren't too
close you should be OK) and
stick left round this corner to
gate six. Now for the final two,
drive *straight* to them - this
is important as otherwise you'll
get hit by a snowball. For
example just before the last
gate a snowball will bounce
straight for you but it'll
bounce over as you head up the
ramp. You should get a rank if
you follow that walkthrough.


-----------
Mission 5-8
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Mario!

You play as Luigi on Mario
Circuit! You should beat Mario
as long as you drift (and mini-
boost) round corners and use the
items for shortcuts, such as on
the second S-Bend with the
piranhas you can cut out the
last corner using mushrooms or a
star. However after the tight
U-Bend the track is covered with
piranhas so weive round them,
drift the final two corners and
finish. Remember to collect the
item boxes to gain a real
advantage.


----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Hit the Big Bob-Omb
with 3 Bob-Ombs!

Here Big Bob-Omb will summon
item boxes and Bob-Ombs in the
arena, so collect the Item Box
(will contain an Item Box), face
his direction and throw it
directly at him so it explodes
straight away. Avoid the Bob-
Ombs on their own as they will
either detonate on their own or
Big Bob-Omb will collect and
throw it anyway. At the start,
don't turbo-start and drive to
an item box, quickly turn and
throw it at him for an easy hit.
For the second hit, drive up to
him and wait until he summons
more items, then grab an item
box and blow him away. Finally,
he will jump in to the air and
move across the arena (you can
see his location on the touch
screen map). Underneath him he
will drop an item box in the
centre, surrounded by live Bob-
Ombs; collect the item box, and
wait until the Bob-Ombs have
detonated then reverse. He will
drop down, and will be a sitting
duck for the final hit for a
high rank.

 4.06. Level 6
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-----------
Mission 6-1
-----------

Objective - Drive backward
across the spinning bridge! If
you fall, you're out!

Not overly hard this; remember
that B is reverse and that the
directions are reversed. When
going over the bridge, drive
against the movement. Remember
that it does stop and change
direction, so when it does stop,
start driving in the other
direction to counter it. It
should only change direction a
maximum of two times. Once you
reach the other side, you
finish.


-----------
Mission 6-2
-----------

Objective - Get Stars and run
over 15 Rocky Wrenches!

Here you are on the deck of an
airship, with Rocky Wrenches
covering the deck (mole like
creatures) and several item
boxes with Stars. You just have
to be really fast and jolt
around when you see one spring
up to take them out. Try and
collect a star before yours runs
out so you can keep going
constantly. Its tough to get
higher ranks here, but as long
as you are fast, quick and don't
hesitate you should do alright.


-----------
Mission 6-3
-----------

Objective - Collect all 30
coins!

This isn't tough to get high
ranks on. Start with a turbo-
start and drive straight ahead
to take advantage of the
mushroom and shortcut. Drift
round the corner and in to the
next line of coins, then do a
tight drift round the next bend
though the mud lake and navigate
carefully through the field of
brown bumps (don't touch any)
while collecting coins. You can
drift the last corner as well.
As long as you drive carefully
and quickly, you should do
alright here.


-----------
Mission 6-4
-----------

Objective - Destroy all 10 item
boxes!

Here 10 item boxes swarm all
over this battle stage. Here is
a walkthrough to get them
quickly and to attain a high
rank. Start with a turbo boost,
and follow the one ahead and
collect it turns left round the
corner (1). Now turn left and up
the ramp, and collect another as
you go round the corner (2).
Proceed over the bridge straight
ahead collecting another box
from the right (3) to the yellow
island but straight away over
the right bridge to the green
area. Now if you were quick
enough, two boxes will intercept
each other just by this ramp -
one from the right, and if you
stay still the other will run
straight in to you (4 & 5). Now
mount up the ramp, turn right
and over the bridge to the blue
area. Here on the top and middle
levels are three boxes, two of
which should come up and the
other you may have to go down
for (6, 7 & 8). Finally, the
last two boxes are located in
the yellow area in the opposite
corner - one on each the top and
middle levels. You should get a
high rank if you follow this
order!


-----------
Mission 6-5
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 8
numbered gates in order!

Start off with a turbo start and
grab an item box for triple
mushrooms. Drift around the
corner and through the first
gate. After use your first
mushroom to fly off the ramp on
to the clouds behind and through
gate two. Use another mushroom
to fly over the gaps and drift
left. Progress onward and use a
mushroom through the third gate
and over the ramp straight
toward the green mesh bridge and
the forth gate. Drift left, and
drive onward and collect the
item box in the middle and use
it straight away through the
five gate. Drift the corner, and
use a mushroom over the cloud in
the middle and through gate six.
Finally, drift through gate
seven and use your last mushroom
toward gate eight that rests
next to the checkpoint.


-----------
Mission 6-6
-----------

Objective - Perform 14 power-
slide turbo boosts in 1 lap!

Racing as Yoshi on his home
turf, Yoshi Circuit (GameCube)
you have to perform 14
powerslide turbos. Sounds tough
but it is very much possible,
considering the length of the
track. As long as you pull off a
turbo on most of the corners you
should be fine here. You can
pull off at least two turbos
inside the tunnel, and don't
worry about doing many in the
section after that up to the
yellow sign (as it's quite tough
there) and if you run out toward
the end you could always do a
slide turbo on straight. If you
want higher ranks then expect to
semi-snake throughout.


-----------
Mission 6-7
-----------

Objective - Collect all 40
coins!

On a face in Tick-Tock Clock,
you gotta collect 40 coins
whilst avoiding hands that
rotate round. Touching one of
these hands will cause you to
lose coins, so if you hit one
then you are better off
restarting. Plus there are
booster panels, but these are
not worth using. Anyway, begin
with a turbo start and go left
and follow the lines. Basically
just follow the lines up and
down and follow a linear path as
much as possible trying not to
leave any or many coins behind.
Keep any eye out on the bottom
screen for the hands, and do it
sharpish to get a high rank.


-----------
Mission 6-8
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Peach!

This is Peach Circuit, reversed.
Drift the first few corners,
through the dirt path and grab
an item box in the hedge area
after. Use this item (star or
mushrooms) through the flowerbed
left and then navigate the maze
like area - however routes are
cut off but the Chain Chomps are
still there, so make it through
and if you can get an item box
from one of their tails. If you
get them then use it through the
flowerbeds in the next two
sections, and at the end go
clockwise around the island (the
route straight to the finish is
blocked) and then onward and
finish. As usual, drifting and
mini-boosts will net you higher
ranks.


----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Use Mushroom boosts
to hit Chief Chilly and knock
him off the stage
   3 times!

Remember the first boss, where
you had to use triple mushrooms
to knock Big Billy off the edge?
Pretty much same here. After
getting whacked once or twice
quickly grab an item box and ram
him with the mushrooms off the
edge of the arena for the first
hit. Before he comes back grab
another Item Box and lure him to
the edge. You can do this by
stay by edge so he is on your
left or right, then reverse and
mushroom him in to the edge. For
the final hit, he will jump any
boosts toward him so you have to
make sure you are very close to
him when you boost so he has no
time to react. This is very
quickly with no mistakes for a
high ranking!

 4.07. Level 7
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

What, Level 7!? To unlock this,
get at least a star ranking on
Missions 1-6 and this will
appear.

-----------
Mission 7-1
-----------

Objective - Perform 6 power-
slide turbo boosts in 1 lap!

Although at first impressions
you may think that doing 6
boosts on Rainbow Road is easy,
you have to remember there are
only a few turns on this track
to pull this off. I find that
the turns after the first
boosts, after the loop-de-loop
up to the corkscrew (even the
tight one after the drop) and
two to finish with are the
easiest to do. The fact that its
really fast is somewhat off
putting, but try and play it
safe and you should do fine.


-----------
Mission 7-2
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Bowser!

Here you race a lap on Bowser
Castle, but like the other
missions of this type various
parts of the course are blocked
off. Thought out make sure that
you make use of *every* item box
to gain a real advantage and to
get a good rank. Anyway, start
and inside go round left or
right and you should make it
past the Thomps before they
fall. Grab an item box but save
it, and drift round the corners,
up the steps and right. In the
moving floor section you have to
go all the way around and take
the shortcut straight to the
tower so use your item here and
drift up the spiraling ascent.
Out the top to the rotating
bridge drop off on the left (the
end of the bridge is blocked)
and use an item through the
grass and collect another item
box, drift the corner and onward
to the moving platforms. The
rest is as normal, so continue
to use the item boxes to
decrease your time and finish.


-----------
Mission 7-3
-----------

Objective - Complete 2 laps
within the time limit!

Two laps on Tick-Tock clock
within 1:30:00. The course is
pretty much the same as usual
bar that there are now three (!)
swinging pendulums and the hands
and the moving cogs are faster.
For the cogs take them wide due
to their fast nature and
remember they switch direction
for the second lap. And for the
pendulums use an item to speed
through them fast (this means
saving a mushroom from the first
item box). Make sure you take
full advantage of all the items
throughout, to drift and mini-
turbo as much as you can and you
should get a high rank indeed.


-----------
Mission 7-4
-----------

Objective - Use shells to defeat
all 30 Goombas within the time
limit!

Another enemy destroying
mission, however here instead
you have to destroy all the
enemies that you see. This time
it's Goobmas, the weapon of
choice being single or triple
shells. Straight away clear as
many Goobmas away as you can,
then move on down the track for
the next set of Goobmas, destroy
them etc. until they are all
gone. With the shells you can
either fire them or barge into
them (triple shells only)
although the latter is rather
time consuming and as long as
you have a decent shot, firing
them is faster. Any time above
20 seconds should get you a
starred rank, so good luck.


-----------
Mission 7-5
-----------

Objective - Collect all 20
coins!

This takes place on Wario
Stadium; if you hit any fire
then you'll lose about five
coins (this is time consuming so
just restart) and if you miss
any then again it is better off
that you start; it's not that
long a mission anyway. Drift
around the first corner, and the
first coins will be two on the
insides of this coming S-Bend.
Continue round and grab three on
the booster ramp and one in the
ring of fire - so hit the
booster dead on. After the
corner coins are placed before
each booster panel across the
mud lake. Two more booster jumps
with rings of fire await you
after the corner, followed by an
s-bend with the fire lines. Only
two coins here, at the start and
end so just race straight
through it all to the end - note
that usually the end line gets
my kart so if it looks like that
is gonna happen to you then slow
down or something. After ward
take the right set of booster
jumps for the final few coins to
finish.

-----------
Mission 7-6
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 8
numbered gates in order!

What seems like a really easy
mission is in fact a rather
tough nut to crack. There are
eight gates in a circle, which
go 1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8 and 4 - so
basically you do two loops
starting from one to finish.
However you have 10 seconds
which isn't much time at all.
You can do it without drifting
but its tough, but you can do it
very easily in one drift if you
get it bang on right. Turbo
start and hold R and right when
around gate 5 goes out the
picture (or when you hit the
white beam) and just hold that
and you'll drift perfectly
though them all for an easy
three star ranking. Although it
might look like you'll hit a
wall just hold tight and
consider it done. Phew.


-----------
Mission 7-7
-----------

Objective - Drive backward and
collect 12 coins! If you hit a
burner, you fail!

Here you are inside an airship,
navigating a small box maze and
then collecting the final coins
through the burners at the other
end. Use B to reverse and head
to the maze, and turn the corner
and collect the first coin. It's
important to know that you
should take it VERY SLOW and
just tap B now and while turning
using the direction buttons,
otherwise you'll over steer and
hit boxes, really slowing you
down. Anyway after this first
coin really slowly turn the
corner (U-Bend) and race down to
the end to the next one. Again,
very slowly turn for the third
coin, and weive in and out the
boxes for the next coins. Again
turn and do the same and out,
and head left and round between
the boxes to the burners. It's a
good idea to wait for either
burner to be well away from the
coins before you go through -
ie. the first burner to be far
right, the second to be fair
left. Finish by collecting the
beyond coin.

-----------
Mission 7-8
-----------

Objective - Break all 10 item
boxes while avoiding the Fake
Items!

Heh, and you thought you had
gotten away from this course,
right? Drift left and then turn
right avoiding the banana skins
and grab the right box (1).
Drift left then use the
mushroom, and grab the left box
(2). Quickly use it and navigate
through the bananas situated at
the corner, then grab the right
(3) then left (4) boxes,
followed by bananas skins. Use
the mushrooms down on to the
walkway below and collect the
left box (5) and round the
corner past yet more banana
skins. Box (6) is as you enter
the building.

Now two choices; easy or hard?
Easy is going right, then sharp
left, over the gap next to the
wooden beam and then turning out
of your way left for the next
box. Or you can turn left as you
enter the building, stick to the
side to avoid the bananas, jump
the gap left and get the box in
a much faster time. While the
latter is harder to pull off,
it's a must do if you want
higher ranks (7).

Either way after grabbing that
box, use the mushroom to the
right and then drift left round
the wall so you avoid the
blockade of fake item boxes, and
turn early and close to the beam
so you grab the next box (8).
Exit the building and drift
left, using the mushroom you
just received on this straight.
Grab the right box (9), drift
left then mushroom it straight
to the last box (10) to finish.

----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Wiggler!

Despite this being the final
boss and all, I find this quite
fun. Mainly because Wiggler is
really awesome and he just
smashes his way through traffic.
Anyway, you race Wiggler on
Mushroom Bridge (NGC) with three
laps to beat him. You have item
boxes to help you that move
along the road, each containing
a star. The star is useful as it
allows you to take advantage of
the shortcut out o f the first
tunnel, straight on, over and
right to the next tunnel), it
allows you to plough through the
traffic and best of all to get
mushrooms from the trucks.

The plan is that you will always
have an item on you. So grab an
item box and use the star, and
when you see a truck (and only
trucks, no cars or coaches)
smash in to it to get a mushroom
and use this when you are
finished. Keep racing until you
find another item box, use the
star, rinse and repeat, and keep
doing this until the end. It's
VERY important to get every box,
even if it means missing out on
that shortcut as that gives you
a huge advantage. It should be
really easy to beat this guy;
the real challenge comes from
getting the very high ranks,
attainable from drifting and
mini- boosting / snaking when
you can. And when you've done
this, you are free of the
missions! Woo-hoo!

         6. UNLOCKABLES
       ------------------
================================

-------------------------------
Unlockable Characters and Karts
-------------------------------

As with Double Dash!! you can
unlock extra characters and
karts by progressing in the
Grand Prix mode.

Dry Bones - Get Gold on all
Nitro Cups in 50CC mode Daisy -
Get Gold on all Retro Cups in
50CC mode

3rd Kart for all characters -
Get Gold on all Nitro Cups in
100CC mode Waluigi - Get Gold on
all Retro Cups in 100CC mode

7 Karts for all characters - Get
Gold on all Nitro Cups in 150CC
mode R.O.B. - Get Gold on all
Retro Cups in 150 CC mode

Choose any kart for any
character - Get Gold on all
150CC Mirror Cups


-----------------
150CC Mirror Mode
-----------------

Getting gold on the first three
Grand Prix Modes (50CC, 100CC
and 150CC) will unlock this
mode. Basically all the tracks
are reversed, but as you've
played each track by at least
three times by now you should be
able to tackle these with
relative ease.


--------------------------------
Alternative Title and Ending
Screens
--------------------------------

Achieve a gold in every cup for
the title and ending screens to
change for good. This includes
the dreaded 150CC Mirror mode as
well.


-----------------
Starred Nicknames
-----------------

Complete all the cups within all
CC classes with a starred rank
to receive a starred nickname.
So complete them all with at
least one star to get a one star
nickname, two for two and three
for three. To see what you have,
check the Records section of the
Main Menu and you'll see it on
the top screen. This is also
shown to you opponents online,
putting a bit of fear in to
them. To see what this looks
like, then unlock a staff ghost
and race them (see below). Looks
quite cool, eh? For tips on how
to get stars on a cup in the
Grand Prix mode, check the Grand
Prix section in Game Modes
(section 4).


-----------------------
Level 7 in Mission Mode
-----------------------

To unlock Level 7 in the Mission
Mode, get an overall 1 star
ranking on all the missions.


------------
Staff Ghosts
------------

Another thing to beat in Mario
Kart DS are Staff Ghosts. Seen
that Time Trial section? Paid
much attention to it so far?
Thought not. However you will
do, as Staff Ghosts are awesome
times set by those who made the
game. First you have to unlock
them, then you can race against
them to see if you can beat
them.

To unlock a staff ghost, get
within about 5-10 of their time
(varies according the course)
and then change course or
something so you see the Ghost
selection screen. If it's
unlocked then you can select to
race against it. And what do you
get if you beat them? Nothing,
apart from the knowledge that
you're quite a good player, plus
you would have picked up a few
new tricks and shortcuts on some
of the courses. Handy for
online, eh?
