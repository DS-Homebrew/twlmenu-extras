1. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[1000]~| |
|_|=============================

The original portable Final
Fantasy Tactics Advance was an
excellent game. Sure, some may
say that the game lacked depth
and a solid storyline, but where
FFTA truly shined was in its
capacity for customization.
There's no rigidity. Players
could mold and shape their own
clan to their heart's content
through its seamless job system.
This is a feature I felt was a
nice breath of fresh air from
the primarily inflexible systems
of other RPGs.

For that reason, I was not all
disappointed with Final Fantasy
Tactics A2. The same
personalization of the original
FFTA was retained, with a whole
bunch of new jobs, abilities,
and other features thrown in.
Many of the more irritating
characteristics of FFTA were
changed for the better. For
example, laws still exist, but
there's no longer any
imprisonment - rather, penalties
are instilled on your party
instead. Players of the original
game should be able to
transition from FFTA to FFTA2
quite easily because many of the
original gameplay mechanics are
still intact.

This guide is designed to walk
players through the game.
Included is a listing of all 400
available missions, full
appendices, and other sections
relating to various aspects of
the game (although obviously not
complete yet). I hope you find
it helpful!

3. Basics ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~[3000]~| |
|_|=============================

Many of the basic aspects of
Final Fantasy Tactics A2 are
explained in the game, along
with the manual of course. The
following sections are a brief
overview of the characteristics
of the game, including the
battle system and laws.

()------------------------------
||                            3.
()------------------------------

If you are familiar with the
battle system of FFT or FFTA (or
even other strategy RPGs), the
system of Final Fantasy Tactics
A2 should not be difficult to
pick up.

              ---

Battles typically begin with you
having to select units to place
on the battlefield. The area
where you begin is designated by
green tiles. In most cases, the
number of units you can place on
the field cannot exceed six.

Turns are determined by the
SPEED stat - units with higher
SPEED are granted earlier turns.
Note that speed-altering status
changes such as Haste, Slow, and
Stop have an effect on turn
order.

When a unit's turn comes up,
three options become available.
You can choose to:

   Move: This allows a character
 represent locations where the s
 that a unit can move is determi
 with a MOVE stat of 4 can move 
 unit can jump is determined by 
 JUMP stat of 4 can jump up to a
 or jump down to another locatio

   Action: This option allows th
 action can be simply attacking 
 the Attack command, using a spe
 Item command.

   Wait: Select this option to c
 doing anything. Wait can be sel
 Units who wait will have an ear

After a unit has finished
his/her turn, you will be
required to select a facing,
which is essentially which
direction you want the selected
unit to be looking to. Facing is
important to battle because it
determines damage. Attacks to
the front will deal the least
damage. Attacks to the side will
deal more damage than attacks to
the front. Finally, attacks to
the back will deal the most
damage.

Battles will progress, with each
unit taking his/her turn until
the fight is finished.

And that's the general gist of
it. It's not at all tough to
pick up.

()------------------------------
|| 3.2. Ability Mastery [3200]
||
()------------------------------

An integral part of this game is
the job system. There are a over
40 jobs spread over the six
available races in Final Fantasy
Tactics A2. Each unique job has
its own set of abilities that
can be mastered through wearing
equipment. This is exactly the
same system used in the original
FFTA, so anyone familiar with
that game shouldn't need an
explanation.

              ---

How does this system work?
Ability mastery relies on AP
(ability points). Many pieces of
equipment come associated with
particular abilities for
different classes. These
abilities will be listed with
the equipment when you view
them. Only the job attached to
the ability is capable of
learning that skill. For
example, a Soldier obviously
cannot learn the Black Mage
ability, Fira.

Alongside each ability is an AP
requirement. In order to master
a particular ability (this means
that you can use the ability
without having to wear the
respective piece of equipment),
you must fulfill this AP
requirement. All units will gain
AP points from completing
battles regardless of whether or
not they actually participated
in the battle. Units who did not
participate will gain AP, but
not EXP, mind.

There are three specific types
of abilities:

   - Action Ability: These are s
 will appear as commands on the 
 considered Action Abilities or 
 two sets of Action Abilities (t
 of up to two jobs).
   - Reaction Ability: These are

 A unit can only have one S-Abil

()------------------------------
||                           3.3
()------------------------------

Laws dictate the forbidden
action of a particular battle.
Unlike the system of FFTA
though, laws are unchanging and
are determined solely by what
battle you are fighting in.

Typically, when you enter
battle, the law will be
presented at the beginning of
the fight. The category is
usually limited to things such
as Fire, where any fire-based
ability or weapon is forbidden,
and Ranged Weapons, where any
ranged weapon is forbidden.
Sometimes, the laws can get
pretty outrageous. There are
actually laws that forbids
Missing, as in missing a target,
and Being Robbed.

Although laws are considerably
tougher to follow at certain
points in the game, punishments
are not that severe (at least in
comparison to the whole jail
thing of FFTA). Upon breaking a
law, the Judge leaves the
battlefield, meaning that any
fallen party members cannot be
revived until the end of the
battle. Also, any activated Clan
Privileges will be annulled and
the reward for abiding by the
law will be removed at the end.

In certain missions, however,
abiding by the law is mandatory,
meaning that if you break the
law, the mission is
automatically forfeited. Clan
Trials are among some of the
missions that require you to
abide by the law.

4. Walkthrough
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[4000]~| |
|_|=============================

This walkthrough contains a
step-by-step rundown of each
story mission critical to the
progression of the game. For
additional information on side-
quests and optional missions,
consult the Missions section,
which contains a list of all 300
recorded missions in the game.

Note that this walkthrough is
not spoiler-free. Read ahead at
your own risk.

[-------------------------------

Ah, it's summer vacation at
last! At the very start, you'll
be asked to write down your
name. Feel free to name him
anything. For the record, I'll
call the main character Luso
(that's his default name).
Afterwards, you will be asked to
fill out a few quick questions
as part of his summer journal
assignment:

 1. This summer I'm going to...
  a) Hang out with my friends!
 b) Play video games non-stop!
    c) Study for next year!

 2. As a personal goal, I want t
a) Be able to swim half a mile!
 b) Get my warrior to level 75!
  c) Learn a foreign language!

3. Next year I promise not to...
     a) Misbehave in class.
  b) Oversleep in the morning.
 c) Let my dog eat my homework.

  Evade Up 2:  b, a, a

  Bonus AP 1:  b, c, c
  Bonus Gil 1: b, a, c
  Bonus CP 1:  b, b, c
  Smash Up 1:  b, b, a

Depending on your selections,
you'll be given a Clan Privilege
bonus at the very beginning.
What does that mean? Clan
Privileges are essentially buffs
and bonuses that you can
activate at the beginning of
battles. Only one can be
activated per battle. These will
come into play later in the
game. For now, make your
selections (I'd recommend Bonus
AP 1 because it will help you
master abilities more quickly
early) to carry on.

Because Luso Clemens has some
behavior problems, he's forced
to go to the library after
school to do some chores. Wow,
what a crummy way to start off
the summer, huh?

Down at the library, Mr. Randell
appears to be nowhere in sight
(for those who have played FFTA,
you might recognize the teddy
bear on the counter). Watch the
rest of the cutscene as it plays
out, as poor Luso is transported
to a mysterious world through
the book, the Gran Grimoire.

The scene shifts to a forest,
where Luso makes his rather
unexpected appearance in front
of Cid and his clan. After a bit
of persuasion from him, Luso
agrees to join the clan that he
meets. Not soon thereafter,
you'll be thrust into your first
battle. Hope you are ready for
it!

Congratulations, you've
successfully completed your
first battle. Granted, there are
more difficult fights to come,
but it's a good start.

Afterwards, you'll be given a
brief introduction to the
workings of the world map. With
that, you will be requested to
approach the area with the blue
balloon over it. However, you
should save your game first. Do
this by opening up the system
menu and selecting the save
option. When you're ready, head
into the Wood Village.

In the local pub, you'll be
introduced to your new clan...
which doesn't quite have a name
yet. Of course, that's all up to
you. However, I do not suggest
naming it Clan Gully. That's
almost as bad as Clan Nutsy back
in the original FFTA.

There is really not much to do
out here, so go to the pub in
Wood Village. Cid will introduce
you to the concept of quests,
which can be found listed at any
pub. Select the quest roster and
check the list of quests. You
should also get used to checking
the rumors as well, for they can
unlock new quests later on.
Right now, I'd suggest reading
the rumors if you're fairly new
to the game, for they hold
important gameplay information.

The only quest available is A
Paw Full of Feathers. Accept it
(at a fee of 100 gil), and a
blue bubble will appear over the
Muskmallow Field. Cid suggests
checking out the local shop
first before you leave. The
selection is pretty bad, so I
wouldn't recommend purchasing
anything at this point.

While leaving the shop, the
shopkeeper suggests that you
check out the bazaar, a new
feature that allows you to put
up loot and get items in return.
Loot is essentially the
leftovers picked up from fights.
This loot can subsequently be
traded at the bazaar for varying
items. The items you get in
return depend on how valuable
the loot is. Better loot leads
to more powerful equipment and
rare items. All unlocked items
become available at the shop
afterwards.

Give it a try! Select the
Apprentice Weapons option and
pick out Gikhet Lead and Faren
Pollen from your loot inventory.
Both of these pieces of loot are
rated E, meaning, in terms of
value, they're at the very
bottom. Still, you can attain
the ability to purchase
Broadswords as a trade. A
Broadsword gives a nice attack
boost to Luso (and teaches the
Soldier skill, First Aid), so
pick it up.

When you're ready to continue,
make your way to Muskmallow
Field for the next mission.

Following the battle, a familiar
face shows up again to scavenge
for some treasure. She happens
to fall right into Cid's
cleverly laid trap.
Unfortunately, she's already
sold off the stolen horn and
spent all the gil.

Back on the world map, head over
to Camoa. Here, the team will
meet Adelle yet again. It seems
like that rat trap hadn't
stopped her. Luso reluctantly
decides to let her join.
Unfortunately, you have no say
in it. It's not a bad thing
since Adelle is a pretty good
Thief. Plus, she comes equipped
with a Khukuri!

Afterwards, the Bisga Highroad
should become available. Finish
whatever business you have in
Camoa and proceed over there.

It's a port, so you can expect

city of Graszton (as if the blue
bubble didn't make it obvious
enough).

A bit of shady business will be
carried out, and a Ninja will
shoot a gun at Cid. He survives,
though he won't be in your party
for a little while. He will
divulge the location of Lezaford
for you - he is in the Aldanna
Range.

The Aldanna Range can be
accessed through a highroad in
the Baptiste Hill region. It's
the northwestern path out.

Having defeated Gilmunto, that
mage Lezaford will show up, and
oh man he is a freaky looking
guy. He'll bring you back to his
cabin.

There, he will ask to see your
journal, which according to
Lezaford, is the key to
returning to Ivalice. In order
to do so, you must first fill
all its pages to release the
powerful magick hidden within.

Return to Graszton to see Cid
again. There, Adelle will bring
up the auction, which is a whole
new aspect of the game in
itself. It's essentially a
bidding system where you can bid
for areas. Become region master
and you will be given the
opportunity to auction for items
- some of these items are very
rare and can be attained through
this method much earlier.
Needless to say, you should look
into it.

However, you won't be able to
access the Auction House for
now, so don't worry about it.
The Rupie Mountains have been

As Luso Leaves the strawood
forest, he remembers that Hurdy
wanted Flutegrass too. This
detail is important, as you will
see later on. Return to any pub
to find Hurdy. He will gladly
take the strawood, and he
requests that you take it to a
Bazaar to turn it into an
instrument. He will give you a
Spiral Vine, along with 2500
gil, to pay for it.

However, if you recall, Hurdy
mentioned Flutegrass before.
Hurdy's Request has two possible
instruments you can make. With
the Spiral Vine, you can make
the Brilliant Theorbo
instrument, which teaches the
Bard skill, Soul Etude and some
Beastmaster techniques. However,
you can also obtain the
Flutegrass, which can be used to
make the Shining Lute.

How do you get the Flutegrass?
Easy. Head over to the Sant
D'alsa Bluff without creating
the Brilliant Theorbo, and you
will come across a continuation
of the Making Music quest, in
which you'll fight a group of
Sprites, Dreamhares, and Lamias.
After defeating these monsters,
you will obtain the Flutegrass.

It is up to you which instrument
you choose to create. Since only
one Strawood can be obtained in
the entire game, you cannot
possibly create both the Shining
Lute and the Brilliant Theorbo.
However, both instruments can be
acquired later in the game.
Personally, I would recommend
the Shining Lute since it
teaches the Bard skill Magick
Ballad, which restores MP to a
unit, along with the Animist
ability, Friend. It is your
choice. Regardless of which
instrument you make, Hurdy will
ask to travel with you
afterwards.

Return to Moorabella to meet
with the appraiser at last.
Adelle will go off by herself to
the pub, where a weird lady will
approach and ask her to work for
her. Adelle refuses, and the
lady leaves. Cid and Luso arrive
shortly thereafter. The magicite
that Ewen dropped was apparently
stolen, and there is a bill at
the pub seeking its rightful
return. The next mission in line
is Seeking the Stone.

In addition to the mandatory
storyline missions, there is a
plethora of extra side-quests
available as well. Because there
are no random clan encounters,
you will have to rely on some of
these extra missions to level up
and gain ability points.

Note that only 300 missions are
recorded in the clan log.
However, there are about 100
more missions that are not
recorded, which totals about 400
missions in all.

The mission report does not go
in numerical order. Rather, it
employs a chart thingy (that
really makes writing out this
part of the guide more difficult
than it should be). On the
report, you'll notice squares
with letters a-e running from
left to right and numbers 1-5
running top to down. There are
25 of these squares in all
(simple math would lead you to
that). Inside each of these
squares are 16 more squares.
Each individual mission takes up
a spot in each of these squares.

The mission list that follows

|_|=============================

Final Fantasy Tactics A2
features two new features that
were not present in the original
FFTA. The bazaar and the auction
house are both new additions.

()------------------------------
||                              
()------------------------------

The bazaar has a pretty simple
function. After finishing
battles, your clan will pick up
various pieces of loot. This
loot can subsequently be traded
at the bazaar in exchange for
unique arms and armor. When
unlocked, these new items become
available for purchase at the
shop.

More valuable loot leads to more
valuable equipment. Under every
bazaar category are letters
ranging from A-E. A is the most
valuable category, and the loot
that is required is typically
harder to come by than say, a
piece of loot rated D.

Different categories unlock
different pieces of equipment.
You can tell what can be
unlocked by checking the grade
on the bazaar screen. Next to
each category is a run-down of
the letters A-E. Wherever there
is a circle indicates that there
is a piece of equipment
available for that letter. An
'X', on the other hand,
indicates that there is no
unlockable equipment for that
particular letter.

 * NOTE: Certain items, when unl
 ONCE (in order to purchase agai
 and unlock the item in the Baza
 marked with an asterisk.

|| 12.2. The Auction House
[12200] ||
()------------------------------

The Auction House is unlocked
after completion of the Now
That's a Fire! mission.


         --- Basics ---


Auctions occur during one month
in every year. At first, you
will bid for regions, but once
you become Champion for Life,
you can bid for items. Many
pieces of rare equipment can be
attained very early in the game
through the use of auctions, so
it's in your best interest to
learn and master this aspect of
the game.

During each auction, you face
off against other rival clans.
The entry fee is 20 CP (your
first auction's fee will be
waived though) At the beginning,
you will be given a set amount
of 1-point coins, 2-point coins,
and 3-point coins. 5-point coins
typically are acquired as a
bonus.

The idea is pretty simple. Place
down the most amount of coins in
each auction to win. However,
you can't just put down all of
your highest coins. Doing so
would severely shorthand your
clan the next round. Rather, you
need to strategically put down
coins as to win each round of
the auction, yet still have
enough coins for the remaining
areas. The winner is always the
clan with the greatest amount of
points. However, it does not
matter if the winner beats out
the opposition by just one point
or 20 points. Therefore, strict
distribution of coins is
instrumental to victory.

In the event of a tie, the
region master is given the win.
If there is a tie between two
clans, neither of which is
region master, then the winner
is selected randomly. The first
clan to reach 30 points
automatically wins the auction.

Notice the timeline on the
bottom of the auction screen.
The bar will slowly fill as the
auction progresses. Bids are put
down at each of the notches in
the bar. Make sure you input
your command prior to each notch
or else you'll miss the
opportunity to put down coins
for that turn. Occasionally, a
'Bonus' box will pop up in one
of the notches. At this point in
the timeline, if your clan is in
the designated position in the
Bonus Box (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.),
your clan will receive a bonus
5-point token.

Upon gaining control of a
region, all quest fees and item
prices there will be reduced.
Not a bad deal, don't you think?

After completing 20 auctions,
the Token Emporium will be
unlocked. Here, you can purchase
tokens for the coming auctions.
At this point, you can
essentially stock up on 5-point
coins and blow away the
competition. The prices are as
follows:

 1-Point Coin: 5 CP
 2-Point Coin: 10 CP
 3-Point Coin: 20 CP
 5-Point Coin: 70 CP

Once you gain control of all
regions in an auction, you will
become Champion for Life,
meaning all regions in the area
are under your control
permanently (kind of defeats the
purpose of auctions now, doesn't
it?). At this point, you can bid
for items instead of regions in
the auctions to follow. Grand
prizes are attained by winning
all of the areas of a region in
one auction.


        --- Strategy ---


The key is to read the
opponent's motives. Their next
action can be determined by the
sprite's animation:

   Thought Bubble        --> Not
   Shaking Head          --> Not
   Standing              --> 1-p
   Walking               --> 2-p
   Defense Pose          --> 3-p
   "!" Bubble Over Head  --> 5-p

The quick pace of the auction
may be nerve-wracking at first,
but over time, you should get a
sense of what to expect from
enemy clans. Their gestures
should become engrained your
mind, so you can quickly make
decisions that'll put you over
the top.

The best strategy to use, after
you've memorized the enemy
clans' gestures and their
corresponding is to be ONE point
ahead of the others. Start off
each auction following the
actions of the other clans. As
soon as one clan appears to
emerge as the leading clan, bid
enough coins to get just ONE
point ahead of first place. Once
you are one point ahead of the
second-leading clan, just mirror
that particular clan's actions
so you always remain just one
point ahead of them. This
strategy works to conserve your
coins for the other rounds.
