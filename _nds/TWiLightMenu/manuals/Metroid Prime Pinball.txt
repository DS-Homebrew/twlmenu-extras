==============================
== 1. GUIDE OVERVIEW/CONTROLS:
==============================
Metroid Prime Pinball is, as you
would imagine, quite different
from your typ- ical Metroid
game. It's an interesting twist
on the original Metroid Prime,
for sure, with all of the areas
intact (except Magmoor Caverns,
which is the default Multiplayer
Table, and Chozo Ruins, which is
surprisingly absent from the
game - a shame, as fighting
Flaaghra could've been
interesting) in surpris- ingly
nice fashion. Read below for
some more in-depth explanations
on the specifics of the game.

  ===================
  ++ 1.1 - MAIN MENU:
  ===================
  From the start menu, you have 
  - Multi Mission
  - Single Mission
  - Wireless Play
  - Options

  MULTI MISSION is where the bul
  of two default tables - either
  work through the other areas (
  where you'll have to square of
  is all single-round, meaning y
  any means of "saving" until yo
  it makes it more like a real p
  ues or extra lives. Well, you 
  point. After passing certain o
  the Single Mission mode, below

  SINGLE MISSION is geared more 
  table. Like Multi Mission, you
  defeating Thardus and Omega Pi
  Drifts and Phazon Mines tables
  Artifacts in Multi Mission and
  can add that table to this mod
  the Impact Crater table here. 
  the only goal is to stay alive

  WIRELESS PLAY uses the built-i
  other Nintendo DS' within a sp
  other people off of a single M
  ball showdown that takes place
  Caverns. At least the menu mus
  the Lower Norfair theme from S
  sounds more like the SM rendit

  session, like the real multipl

  OPTIONS, obviously, is the def
  a lot to choose from - you can

  can negate this entirely by ju
  the GBA slot).

  A fifth mode, EXPERT MISSION, 
  normal Multi-Mission mode at l
  ramped up, you earn less point
  more frequency.

  ==========================
  ++ 1.2 - DEFAULT CONTROLS:
  ==========================
  To the best of my knowledge, t
  altered. It's not like the con

  R BUTTON/RIGHT D-PAD BUTTON - 
  L BUTTON/LEFT D-PAD BUTTON  - 

  POWER - Duh? Turns NDS off
  SELECT - No Function
  START - Pauses the Game

  X BUTTON - Missiles (in Combat
  A BUTTON - Right Flipper
  Y BUTTON - Power Bomb (in Morp
  B BUTTON - Bombs (in Morph Bal

  Unlike most DS games, this one

  The Bounty Bonus is based on t
  - Total number of each enemy k

  - How many times you hit the B

  The good thing about this is t
  not just the ball you were pla
  worth more the more you play. 
  Reward Scanner is key so you c
