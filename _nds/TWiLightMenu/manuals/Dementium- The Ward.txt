   Grant O, Sean, Shannon, The A

 - Chrissy, Michael, nikruss add




If you feel like you have a
better strategy for any of the
boss fights, by all means, send
them my way, I will add them to
the guide and give you full
credit for it.

Be sure to give me a name so
that I can give you your due
credit.

At the time of this submission,
there is now a Boss Guide up at
GameFAQs.com and I highly
recommend you take a look at it.
Sure, I have covered the bosses
in this guide and some people
have now offered their advice
which is posted in each bosses'
respective section, but you
never know who will have the one
tip that will make your game
easier.



You may not have read the
introduction and you may in fact
be skipping over this part and
if you are, well, that's too
bad. A glitch has been
discovered that lets you have
the zooming function of a sniper
rifle with any of the guns.

Equip the sniper rifle once it
is out of ammo. Begin firing the
gun. While you are firing it,
tap on the weapon you want to
use a scope with. And that is
all there is to it!

A big thanks to Chas Brother for
submitting that to the guide. If
Chas did discover that, I don't
mean to rob his credit. I had
seen it posted on the GameFAQs
message boards once before, but
didn't copy the info or remember
how to do it. I don't know who
discovered it, but Chas made me
aware of it.

time.

grotesque surgical experiments
that wander the halls, a series
of challenging puzzles and a
cast of peculiar characters, you
must face your deepest fears,
unlock the mysteries of the
hospital, and escape with your
life.

________________________________

IV - WEAPONS
________________________________

Flashlight - Chapter 1: The
Admittance

While not a true weapon, it is
placed among the weapons on the
touch screen. Its primary use is
to obviously light your path but
it can also be used to deter the
roaches!



Nightstick - Chapter 1: The
Admittance

Some guard was nice enough to
die and leave this behind. It is
your basic melee weapon and used
as a fallback option when the
ammo is too low.



Pistol - Chapter 2: The Rooftop

A standard 9mm handgun with a 24
round clip. Not terribly
powerful, but is better than the
nightstick in that you can
defend yourself from a distance.



Shotgun - Chapter 4: The Cleaver

A weapon that packs a punch.
Much better than the pistol, the
shotgun can hold 16 shells.



Electric buzz-saw - Chapter 6 -
The Electric Buzz-saw

It is a close range weapon and
it makes a lot of noise but it
will also make short work of
whatever gets in your way. Just
hold the attack button down for
continuous use. You can now
officially retire the
nightstick.



Machinegun - Chapter 07 - The
Main Security Room

An automatic that packs a punch,
literally. Watch that it doesn't
kick you back too far when you
use it.



.357 revolver - Chapter 09 - The
Hole in the Wall

Slow but powerful.



Sniper Rifle - Chapter 11 - The
Guard Tower

Equip the sniper rifle to use
it. UP and down on the D-pad
lets you zoom in and out, L
fires. It can hold up to 16
rounds of ammo. The gun comes
equipped with a nightvision
scope.


________________________________

V - PICK-UPS
________________________________

Health -

A bottle of pills that will
replenish two green health dots
per bottle.



9mm Ammo -

Bullets for the handgun. One box
provides 8 rounds.



Shotgun Ammo -

Shells for the shotgun.



Machinegun Ammo -

Rounds for the machinegun. One
clip provides ten rounds.



Magnum ammo -

Rounds for the .357 revolver.
One box holds 6 rounds.



Sniper Ammo -

Rounds for the sniper rifle. One
box contains 4 rounds.


________________________________

Enemies
________________________________

The following is the list of
enemies in the game. I will try
to detail characteristics and
strategies for killing them.

If there are official names for
these guys, I am unaware, but I
will describe them the best I
can so you will know exactly
which enemy I'm talking about.

Freaks -

These are the first enemies you
encounter, and you will
encounter many more before the
game is over. They are humanoid
with an exposed heart. Target
the heart when you fight these
since that is its weak spot.

I call these guys freaks in
stead of zombies because to me
they really don't classify as
your stereotypical zombie. These
guys are more akin to the
infected in the 28 Days/Weeks
Later movies. They don't want to
eat you, they just want to kill
you. Isn't that nice of 'em?



Roaches -

Not terribly formidable, but
numerous. Keep your distance if
possible. The flashlight can be
used to drive them away from
you.



Worms -

You first see these in Chapter 3
- The Infant Ward. They usually
come from the duct work. Don't
waste too much ammo on these
things as they usually can be
ran past.



Banshees -

Holy terrors. You are not
equipped to properly fight the
banshees when you first
encounter them. These things are
the flying heads that scream as
they patrol which ever room they
are in. I suggest running from
them until you get your hands on
the buzzsaw.



Crawlers -

These are like the freaks in
that they too are humanoid, but
these guys have no legs. They
are the evil version of Lt. Dan.
They can crawl on floors, walls
or ceilings, so be sure to check
every where in the rooms where
you hear them scream.

Be careful when fighting them
though. If you blast their heads
off, their torsos will continue
to spout green fluid at you.
Attack with something fast and
powerful and preferably from a
distance. The buzzsaw is
generally ineffective against
them.



Flying insects -

The polar opposites of the
roaches. Like the roaches, they
move en mass, but in stead of
being driven away by the
flashlight, they are drawn to
it. Be sure to shut it off when
you are near them.



Green worms -

These are like the regular worms
but they are harder to kill.




BOSSES -



Cleaver -

One hand is a meat cleaver, the
other has a syringe. He will hit
you with the cleaver to injure
and stun you and shoot some kind
of fluid at you from a distance
with the syringe.



Gatlingun Wheelchair Guy -

He likes to keep his distance,
so if you get too close, he will
flee from you. Don't let him get
still though, once he does, he
will ready his gatlin gun and
fire at you.



Green Mouth Room -

Such a creepy room. Several
mouths are positioned on the
walls, emitting some foul green
fluid and generating green
worms.



Boss 6 -

I don't want to spoil this for
you . . .

Dementium: The Ward Walkthrough


CHAPTER 1 - The Admittance

________________________________


Once you have control, follow
the on-screen prompts. This
first Chapter acts as a
tutorial, yet it is still a part
of the story. The controls are
covered in a previous portion of
this guide and as you play the
game you will be instructed as
well, so I will not go over them
in the walkthrough unless it
seems necessary.

Do what the screen says and get
adjusted to the controls. Take a
look around the room. Notice the
osculating fan in the corner?
The rain outside the windows?
The way the room slights up from
the lightning flashes? How about
that music? This game has set a
nice, dark atmosphere.

Look around the room until you
find the hallway. Proceed
towards the door. Stop to check
out the flashing thing on the
floor, it is the notepad. This
will come in handy in just a
minute. Head out of the door.

Now you are in the hallway, it
is dark and there is an
announcement saying to evacuate
the building. Explore all you
want, but there are only so many
places you can go right now, all
the doors are locked. Notice the
clipboard hanging by the door to
the room you just came out of?

Turn right and head down the
hallway. Examine the news- paper
on the floor. "Man brutally
murders wife?" The notepad said,
"Why did you do it?" Are both of
these referring to you?

Just past the newspaper is a
room on the right, go in. On the
wall is a number written in
blood, "081399," better mark it
down on your notepad, it might
come in handy later. Head back
to the hallway.

Turn right and go straight. What
the crap was that!?! The blood
trail begins in the room with
the number. The clipboard
doesn't have a name for her.

Make a left turn and proceed
down the hallway. Notice the
flashing object on the cart?
It's a flashlight! Nice! Tap it
on the screen to equip it and
use the L shoulder button to
turn it on or off. Don't worry
about battery life, they won't
run out.

There is nothing behind the
counter, so make a left and head
towards the red door. There is a
keypad, try entering the code
you found scribbled on the wall.

An alarm and a dead guy, this
doesn't bode well. Look past the
dead guy, it is a nightstick.
Finally, something to defend
yourself with!

Take a look in the room to the
left, inside you will find the
7th floor map! Now you can get
an idea of where you are at and
where you are going.

Look past the computer monitors,
in that cage. SHOTGUN!! Damn!
It's locked.

Head back out into the hallway
and follow the path. As it makes
a right turn, you will hear a
new noise, doesn't sound too
friendly. Use the R shoulder
button to quickly switch between
the flashlight and nightstick.

Ease forward and look in the
closets in the hall. What the
hell is that thing? Beat it down
with the nightstick, be quick or
you will take some damage. Or,
you could just run right past
it. It will chase you for a bit,
but you should be able to out
run it.

Continue down the hall. As it
turns to the left, there will be
a closet directly in front of
you, look inside for some health
pickups. Continue down the
hallway.

To your left are some restrooms
and to your right the Patient
Ward. There is a message written
on the men's restroom mirror. I
don't recommend entering the
women's restroom. Huh, I wonder
if curiosity will get the better
of you... From the hallway, open
the door to the Patient Ward.

As you make your way through the
room, you notice the dead bodies
scattered about. Listen for that
creepy breathing noise the
freaky guys make. If you hear
it, one of them rose from the
floor and is about to attack
you. For best results, just run
through this room to the other
side and through the door. If
you want to though, you may find
it safer to approach the bodies
on the floor and begin beating
them with the nightstick.

In the next room, you can find
some health pick-ups behind the
counter, but that is all there
is here, keep going.

After you enter the next room,
roaches will come out and attack
you. you can't defeat them, so
just run past them (double-tap
up on the D-pad) or you can use
the flashlight to drive them
back into the shadows. After
entering the room, turn left. At
the end of the hallway the path
is blocked, so head through the
doors.

It's a stairwell. Can't go down,
so proceed upwards. There's a
sign saying "ROOF ACCESS." When
you reach the top of the stairs,
you will be at the door leading
to the roof, step outside.


________________________________

CHAPTER 2 - The Rooftop

________________________________


Great, rain. Follow the path and
as you round the corner you will
probably hear more freaks
climbing over the fence. The
chances of you getting ambushed
and out numbered are pretty good
here, so I recommend just
running. Sure, you will probably
take a little bit of damage, but
it won't be near as bad as
fighting the bad guys. Once your
reach the part where the path
way declines, the enemies won't
chase you past that.


****************************

Tip provided by: eric

Roof—the reason I am emailing is
to point out the you don’t have
to run thru the roof—it is safer
but you can take those guys out
when they climb up no problem

All you have to do is walk and
when you hear them just turn to
face them with the night stick
and head in swinging—you can
actual connect while they are
still climbing and get a good
hit or two in before they have
time to face you—in all I think
there was three climbers and I
got hit once—its not perfect
like the pistol kills but if you
don’t want to just run but
rather fight this is effective--
eric


********************************

As you proceed across the roof
top, you will see a trail of
blood. It is difficult to tell
if it is leading to or coming
from the small building to the
left, but take your chances and
enter it anyway.

Let this be a reminder to you to
always watch your back. Look!
That guy dropped his pistol! Get
it! That's much better than the
nightstick! Don't just shoot the
freak, aim for his exposed
heart, that is his weak spot.
Obi-wan would be proud! (Episode
III reference) Before you leave,
check the back of the room for
some more ammo and a few pill
bottles.

After you finish up in this
room, head back out on the
rooftop and follow the blood
trail. I still recommend running
to the next door. Again, you may
get attacked a time or two, but
just keep running. You will see
a solitary freak in the path
ahead of you. Quickly dispatch
him with your pistol then enter
the door. If you somehow got
turned around , just remember to
follow the blood trail.

Another stairwell. There are
three bottles of pills in the
corner on the floor to replenish
any health you may have lost,
but be quick! As you approach
the steps leading down, you'll
face roaches once again. Just
run downstairs.

Ignore the first set of double
doors, running past them to the
second set of double doors. You
can't go any further down, the
path is blocked. Step through
the double doors.



________________________________

CHAPTER 3 - The Infant Ward

________________________________

There's that little girl you saw
earlier. Where'd she run off to?

Damn, more creepy hallways.
Watch out as you begin walking
down the corridor. A freak will
burst out of the first room to
the right. Look at the clipboard
on the wall, "Jools Watsham."
You just killed Jools, the lead
guy of Renegade Kid, the
producers of this game! Good
thing he completed the game
before you off'ed him.

Inside Jools' room you will find
some ammo, grab it if you need
it.

Back out in the hallway, across
from Jools' room is the room of
Greg Hargrove, Jools' partner
(in the non-gay way). As a
matter-of-fact, all of the
clipboards in this hallway bear
the names of the guys that
helped to get this game made,
see the back of the games
booklet for more info.

As you make your way down the
corridor, you will get ambushed
two more times. After
dispatching the freaks, raid
their rooms for extra ammo.

The path to the left is the way
that little girl ran to. You can
hear her crying, but the path is
blocked. Go through the double
doors at the end of the hall.

An operating room. There is some
health to the right on the
counter. Go through the door on
the left wall, you know, the one
with blood all over it, not the
nice, clean, safe-looking door
(its locked anyway).

Before you move into range and
the freaks become aware of you;
there are health pick-ups in the
open closets. You cannot enter
the door directly across from
you, and the left path is
blocked. Either kill or run past
the freak and go right and
through the door.

You just stepped into a hallway
that looks like a waiting room.
Notice the yellow door to your
left? We'll be coming back here
in a minute. For now though, go
right and into the waiting area.
On the first chair you come to
you will find the map for this
floor. Continue down the
corridor. At the end will be a
freak aimlessly pacing the
floor. I suggest ignoring him
and running to the door on the
left.

Proceed through the hallway.
There will be a freak in a
closet to the right, but he is
easily bypassed. Wait! Look in
the incubators! What the hell?
Those certainly aren't human
babies. Keep going down the
hallway, ignoring the door on
the right, it is locked, round
the corner and step through the
door.

Head right. The closet on the
right has some ammo. There are
some more of those worm things,
keep going. At the end of the
hall will be a door with a
picture of a rainbow some kid
colored. Before you step through
the door, look at the chair just
to the right. On it is a book,
examine it. It is a piano book
with this image:



   C#  D#      F#  G#   A#
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| C | D | E | F | G | A | B |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

Now, step into the room. In here
you will find health and ammo,
take what you need. In the back
of the room is a small piano
with the word "DEAD" written on
the wall above it. Is it a trap?
One way to find out! Examine the
piano and play the notes
D,E,A,D. Look, the top of the
piano opened! Check inside. You
got a keycard. Cool. This is
what you need to go through the
yellow doors like you saw
earlier.

Backtrack to the door I said to
remember. The worms will burst
out of the incubators and attack
you. They crawl along the floor
and walls as they approach.
Treat them like the Flood in
Halo, fire at them while
retreating.

For now though, I recommend just
running. Once you step through
the yellow door, you should find
enough health to replace what
you may have lost. This will
also reserve your ammo.

After stepping through the
yellow door, check the security
room to the right for some ammo
and that health I told you
about.

Proceed down the corridor. After
it turns to the right, you will
see the path ahead blocked off,
so keep following the open path.
Check the closets for pick-ups
and keep your ears open for
freaks. You can actually run
past them if that is your
preferred method.

Look at your map, this area
makes a "figure 8," only square,
like on a digital clock. You
need to get to the yellow door
on the other side of the
blockage.


_______________________Y_
__S___   __*__   _____  |
 | |    |   |    | |
 | |    |   |    | |
 | |____|   |____| |
 |_________________|

"S" is where you started from.
"*" is the blockage. And "Y" is
the yellow door. Once you turn
right at the blockage you can
take either way to get to the
door.

After stepping through the
yellow door, you will see some
ammo ahead of you. Don't grab it
just yet. As you round the
corner worms will drop from the
air conditioning duct-work. Take
them out with the pistol, then
replenish your ammo. As you go
down the hall, there will be a
couple of freaks in the closets,
either kill them or run past
them. Step through the next
yellow door.

You will have to do some
fighting in this hallway. Behind
the counter is some ammo, but
don't get it yet unless you
absolutely need it. Turn to face
the hallway.

If you try to run, towards the
end of the hall, worms will drop
out of the duct-work again, and
this time they will hit you and
slow you down, which will give
the freaks you just evaded the
time they need to catch up with
you and join the attack. Slowly
make your way down the hall,
taking the enemies out one at a
time and picking up the pick-ups
as you go. After you clear the
hall of nasties, go back and get
the ammo if you left it there,
then exit the door at the end of
the hall.

As soon as you enter this small
room, worms will drop out of the
duct-work like before. Just run
past them to the double doors
directly in font of you.

You are in a Patient Ward like
you saw in Chapter 1, this time,
it is a haven - no enemies and
some recovery items! Before you
go through the double doors at
the other end of the Ward, equip
your pistol. Enter the next room
with your pistol in hand, not
your flashlight.

Quickly take out the freak, now
the room is secured. You can
find some ammo in the corner of
the room. Go out the glass
double doors.

You are in a skywalk. There are
two flying enemies just ahead
that will soon notice you and
begin attacking you. It takes 6
bullets to put one of these guys
down, so unless you are a really
good shot, firing at them is a
waste of time and ammo, and even
a waste of life. I died several
times trying to fight my way
past them. So, as you no doubt
have guessed, I recommend
running for your dear sweet
life!

Run past them and take the path
to the right.


*******************************

Tip provided by: Xieyi21

I managed to found out another
way to take care of the banshees
that you had specified

Jus need to equip with the
pistol and when you hear them
coming then shoot straight at
their face for about 5 to 6
 rounds, they will then escape a
back for a while makes it easier
to walk pass the area without
getting hurt by running away by
them

hope them helps in your
walkthrough.


***************************


If you managed to kill the
flying monstrosities, take your
time and in stead of going to
the right, go straight. Sure,
the path has been destroyed, but
with the flashlight equipped,
you will be able to see that you
are in fact on a skywalk,
connecting two buildings and
that there are 7 floors.

After exiting to the right, you
will be in a long, straight
pathway. Here you will find
recovery items and chances are,
you will need them. Make sure
your health is as good as you
can get it before you go through
the doors at the end of the
walkway.

There are two more flying
banshees here. What ever you do,
make sure you turn left. The
path to the right is a dead end,
and quite literally. So run to
the left and go through the
doors.


________________________________

CHAPTER 4 - The Cleaver

________________________________

Make your way down the corridor.
What is it about a little girl
singing that is so damn eerie?
The first path to the right
holds some ammo and behind the
counter is some more ammo and
health.

Proceed down the path across
from the counter. There is that
girl again! Why did she point?
Keep going. Worms will pop out
of the sidewall vents and from
an overhead vent. Deal with them
and go through the door.

To your right, on top of a cart
is the map. You can either go
straight or take a left. Both
lead to the same place but I
find the left path to be easier.
Which ever way you take, go slow
and easy and take the enemies
out as quickly as possible.

If you went straight, it
connects to the left path, so
once you are in that hallway,
turn right. If you took the left
door in the room where you found
the map, just keep going
straight. Round the corner to
the left at the end of the hall,
and keep going to the exit.

You are now in a morgue. There
are dead bodies and roaches
every where. Don't worry, these
dead guys will not rise to
attack you. You can find some
recovery items in the closets
and once you are done, exit the
door at the other end of the
room.

You are in another area with a
security room. Check inside for
anything you can salvage. There
is a piece of paper on the
counter top, it reads:

Perhaps you seek the truth
The truth is all lies
Purloined of their youth
Count the dead men's eyes

 . . . Ok?  Probably some weird 
that. Anyway. Look, there is
another cabinet with a shotgun
inside. Examine it. Whoa! There
is a combination lock, but what
is the combination? Maybe that
poem had the answer.

Perhaps you seek the truth
The truth is all lies
Purloined of their youth
Count the dead men's eyes

No numbers in it, but it said to
count the dead mens eyes. What
dead men? Those you saw in the
morgue? Give it a try. Go back
and count the dead guys and then
enter the number of eyes to
unlock the cabinet.


The answer is:







0
1
2


SWEET! Now you've got a shotgun!
Now you can step through that
yellow door and deal with
anything!

Make your way down the hall.
Watch out! This freak spits at
you! Now they attack from a
distance too!?!

Take the wooden door on your
right, the path ahead is locked
and blocked.

In the room past the wooden
door, you'll find some shotgun
and pistol ammo. Part of the
wall has been busted down, that
is your pathway. Run to the
right and go through the door at
the end.

What is that sound? Scraping?
Metal on metal? Maybe some one
sharpening something? Check the
closets for pick-ups, then go
through the clean door.

The path ahead is blocked, so
take the only other option.

Up ahead is another blood trail,
follow it to the right. Before
you go through the double doors,
take the path to the right. At
the end, you will find some very
valuable pick-ups. After you get
them, go through the double
doors.


BOSS 1 -


Ok, that thing doesn't look too
friendly and it is coming your
way. Hit it with your shotgun.
It will try to squirt some kind
of fluid at you, so side step
it.

Your shotgun blasts will hurt
it, but it will still probably
run up to you and hit you. You
will fall to the ground a bit
stunned. The Cleaver will walk
away from you.

Use this time to recover and get
into a better firing position.
Continue the pattern of firing
and retreating and dodging his
attacks when you can. Also watch
out for worms that will be in
the room.

Once he falls, follow the blood
trail out the other end of the
room.

********************************

The following boss tip provided
by: XenomorphNL

boss 1: the cleaver.

your hit and run technique is
good, used it myself as well
when i first encountered the
cleaver.

but instead of firing your
shotgun-shells into his body,
its better to fire them to his
mouth. the damage will be much
greater in that way!

********************************

so with the first boss, the
cleaver. i found a clever and
slightly cheating way to do it.

-Once you enter the room and the
plays, shoot him and move to the
right as close to the wall as
you can. this SHOULD make him
not be able to get to you its
almost short of blocking him so
you can shoot away and i think
only his green stuff will shoot
at you. BTW shooting him in the
mouth does massive damage to
him.

:) hope it helps all

- Shannon

********************************

When you enter the room to fight
the cleaver. wait until he
shoots his green stuff at you
when he does side step right and
wait in the corner to the right
of the door you came in from. He
will get stuck on the corner and
won't shoot his green stuff at
you but you have a perfect shot
at his head.

- The Ace

********************************

Ahead of you is some health,
grab it then step into the
elevator. Approach the buttons
and "Use" them. Touch the
flashing button.




________________________________

CHAPTER 5 - The Courtyard


________________________________

Head out of the elevator, down
the hall and through the doors.

Cool, you're outside, no more
creepy hallways. Go down the
steps. Is that Jane Doe from
earlier? So she didn't get
chopped up! She dropped a key,
go get it.

Before you head down the steps,
there is a door to your left. It
is unlocked and leads to the
roof of that small building.
Once you reach the top, you will
find a door with a keypad. The
code you found earlier will not
work here, you'll have to find
another.

Back in the courtyard, go down
the steps and through the iron
gate.

You are in another courtyard. At
the top of the steps, stop and
look to the left. You will see a
set of double glass doors,
double wooden doors, and a
single metal door.

Go in the single metal door.
Another stairwell to the roof.
Check it out.

On the rooftop, there is another
door with a keypad and you still
don't have the code. But look at
your feet, there is a picture of
a woman with the number 31
scratched into it. "31" isn't
the code for the door either.
Head back down to the courtyard.

The double glass doors looks
like they lead back into the
hospital, so let's try the
wooden doors.

It is a chapel. To your left is
a book with the original title
scratched out and "3rd Floor
West Building" written beneath
it. You don't know what this
means yet, but keep it filed in
the back of your mind. You may
even want to write that down in
the notepad.

Head up the isle and look in the
first pew on your left, another
book. Its title has been
scratched out too with Guard
Tower written beneath it.

Go up and behind the pulpit.
There is an open photo album
with a picture missing. The part
of the picture you found earlier
fits there, but it seems there
are two missing parts. You'll
have to return here once the
others are located to complete
the image.

Head back out to the courtyard
and through the double glass
doors.

Go around the corner and head
towards the elevator. There is
another part of that picture
here on the floor. After taking
in picture, set into the
elevator, approach the control
panel and press the flashing
button.



________________________________

CHAPTER 6 - The Electric Buzz-
saw


________________________________

Step off the elevator. The path
is blocked on all sides except
the left path. If you look past
the blockade to the right, you
will see a yellow door. You
can't reach it yet though. Turn
to the left and be sure to snag
the map off of the table.

In this room, there are two
yellow doors that lead to the
right. It doesn't matter which
you take, they both lead to the
same place. There is health
scattered around the room. Once
you are finished scavenging the
room, go to the yellow door in
the south west corner of the
room.

Across the hall is a wooden
door, quickly enter to avoid the
worms. Inside is a briefcase but
you need three keys to open it.
Look around the rest of the
room. On the desk is what looks
like a journal entry. Just who
are the different pronouns
referring to?

On the floor is another journal
entry. Experiments? Think it is
referring to the monsters you've
been fighting? If so, then what
do you think it is talking about
in reference to the cures? Cures
for what? And who is this "He?"

Go in the restroom and look by
the sink, another entry.

Step out of the restroom and you
will see another note on the
chair. It mentions a bronze key,
possibly one of the keys needed
to open that briefcase. Might
want to check the men's room by
the staff lounge.

Go through the busted wall. On
the restroom floor is another
note, this one about the silver
key. So, we need to look for the
office near the central walkway.

Look at all of the blood in that
last stall. Either some one got
killed on the pot or ate some
really bad Taco Bell. What am I
saying, there's no such thing as
bad Tace Bell! Exit the restroom
through the main door (not
through the broken wall).

You will encounter a new enemy
here. These humanoids with no
legs, just torso, will come
crawling at you, and will spit
at you when in range. After you
deal with the three crawlers, go
left (west on the map). Peek
into the open rooms to look for
health or ammo, then go through
the double doors at the end of
the hall.

You are in a stairwell, go down.
It is blocked, but there lies
the golden key! The way upstairs
has been blocked as well, so
head back out into the 5th floor
hallway.

Defeat the crawlers again, then
go straight and through the
double doors marked "Staff
Only."

Grab health from the closet if
you need it then step through
the yellow door.

Turn left and go through that
yellow door.

The security room has plenty of
ammo, make sure to max out your
guns, then go through the white
door.

We don't know where the staff
lounge is yet, but the central
walkway is down the hall to your
right.

You are back in the room that
the elevator is in, this time
you are on the other side of the
blockage. A look around this
rooms reveals it to be a dead
end, though you can find
recovery items in the closets.
Once you are through here, exit
the north west door.

There are worms, but you can
avoid them. Go through the door
directly across from you.

Go straight then hang a right at
the end of this hall. Follow it
around to the next junction. You
will see some double doors in
front of you and a single door
to your left. Take the double
doors, they are marked "Lounge."
This sounds like one of the
places we want to be.

Avoid the roaches and go left.
Step through the double doors at
the end of the south end of the
lounge.

Ah, a men's room and a lady's
room. The note for the bronze
key said to check the men's
room. Watch out for the roaches
and check the middle stall. You
now have the gold and bronze
keys. One more to go. If the
roaches hurt you, check the
lady's room for some health,
then go back into the lounge.

Shoot straight across the lounge
and through the north exit
double doors. The flying bugs in
this room are drawn to your
flashlight. Quickly shut it off
to avoid taking damage. Make
your way to the other door.

The path to the left leads to a
stairwell, but there is a
blockade set up. You can find
some recovery items though.

Watch out for crawlers. When the
hall branches left or right, go
left and through the yellow
door. The right path is a dead
end.

Simply run through this room,
avoiding the worms, to the other
end.

Straight ahead is a dead end,
blocked off. The wooden door to
your right leads to pick-ups.
Once you are finished gathering
goodies, head to the east across
from the wooden door.

BOSS 2

This guy may be handicapped but
he can still kick your ass. Look
at your map. Use the path of the
outer perimeter to approach the
gatlin-gun-wheel-chair-guy.

As soon as the cut scene is
over, dash to the right and make
your way to him. he sees that
you ware getting too close, so
he will flee from you. Chase him
down, firing as often as you
can. Only use the flashlight it
he gets far from you. There is
enough light when you are within
range.

When he gets far away enough
from you, he will turn to face
you and start shooting. When he
does, take the path around the
outside again to get close to
him.

Repeat the process of cat-and-
mouse and sneaking around to his
side, firing off a round as
often as you can. Once he is
down, orenintate yourself by
looking at the map and take the
east exit.

The following boss tip provided

boss 2:

mister "i'm-handicapped-
but-i'll-shoot-yer-eye-out".

multiple times i've tried to
find the weak spot of this boss,
but now í've got it:

you might want to try this:


   ]* [

 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    ---------     ------------

he:*
the way you walk: >/<

run up and down the hallway, so
that he fires his gun empty on
you. when you've done this 3/2
times or so, he'll reload. then
run to him and start shooting 1
bullet. íf you hit him he'll get
hit, and after that he'll start
reloading again. so he can't
drive away when you approach.
then you'll be standing in front
of him. guess what comes next?
yup, a nice and clean headshot!
use this technique until he's
dead.

The following boss tip provided
by: Ron W

********************************


You start in the room like this:
^ - you
* - enemy

_____|  |_____
|            |
|  ___* ___  |
|  | |  | |  |
|  |_|  |_|  |
|            |
|  ___  ___  |
|  | |  | |  |
|  |_|  |_|  |
|            |
|_____  _____|
 |^ |

You want to get yourself into a
position like this:

_____|  |_____
|            |
|  ___* ___  |
| >| |  | |  |
|  |_|  |_|  |
|            |
|  ___  ___  |
|  | |  | |  |
|  |_|  |_|  |
|            |
|_____  _____|
 |  |

or this:

_____|  |_____
|            |
|  ___* ___  |
|  | |  | |  |
|  |_|  |_|  |
|    ^       |
|  ___  ___  |
|  | |  | |  |
|  |_|  |_|  |
|            |
|_____  _____|
 |  |


Basically positioning yourself
close enough so that he tries to
shoot at you, but behind the
wall where his shots won't hit
you.

Make sure you are not too far
away, like this:

_____|  |_____
|            |
|  ___* ___  |
|  | |  | |  |
|  |_|  |_|  |
|            |
|  ___  ___  |
|  | |  | |  |
|  |_|  |_|  |
|    ^       |
|_____  _____|
 |  |

or he won't shoot at you.

After five bursts of gunfire, he
will begin reloading. That is
your chance to run up to him and
unload one shotgun blast to his
head. Only one though because
you cannot hurt him while he is
still flashing red from the
first shot, so any other shots
are wasted.

From there, he will ride off to
another intersection, and you
begin the process again.

 - Ron W

********************************

After exiting through the east
door, the way to the left is
blocked. So head down the
hallway to the wooden door at
the end.

This is the office near the
walkway that the one note
referred to. Grab whatever
health and ammo you may need and
look in the restroom to find the
silver key near the sink.

Step back out into the hallway.
Now ask yourself, do I really
want to backtrack all the way to
that briefcase? Because if you
don't, the exit to CHAPTER 7 is
just up ahead. If you want to
back track, then read on, if
not, then skip ahead to the
triple asterisk (***). But it is
well worth the effort to look in
the briefcase.

Use your map to find your way
back to the briefcase. The
yellow doors are the opened
paths that you can take. It
really isn't as confusing as it
may seem. Return to and pass
through the Staff Lounge. In the
Lounge, take the door in the
middle of the room.

Once you get to the very center
of the mp, head south to the
next intersetion. Go west
through the door and you will
see the lady's room to your
left.

Go back through the hole in the
wall and into the office. Locate
the briefcase and open it. you
now have the electric buzz-saw!

Now make your way back to the
office where you got the silver
key, well, not to the office,
but that hallway.


***

Go through the yellow door. You
are back in the room with the
elevator, but you cannot go far.
Take the double glass doors to
your left.

You are on another skywalk and
there are two screaming banshee
that will soon be on you. You
have a shotgun this time and it
only takes two direct hits to
kill them or you could just run.
Either way, take the left exit,
the part of the skywalk that
heads north. After you step
through the doors, it is quite
safe. Go to the left and through
the double doors to find
recovery items. Once you have
your fill, go back to the
skywalk and take the double
doors at the north east part of
the map.




________________________________

CHAPTER 7 - The Main Security
Room


________________________________

You are in some sort of lobby.
To your right are some
restrooms. The lady's room is
empty and surprisingly NOT
bloody. There is some health
pick-ups in the men's room but
you probably won't need them.

Go through the double doors.

You are in some kind of shopping
area. The first set of doors to
your right are locked. Go into
the next room on the right. On
the bottom of the shelf to your
left is the 5th floor map.
Ignore the door in the back for
now.

The last store on the right is
Deuncil Drug where you can find
some health.

I do not recommend going east
through the double doors. That
path is the long way to the same
hallway you will reach by going
through the back door of the
room where you found the map.

I have gone east and it simply
isn't worth the time, health, or
ammo. there are no other paths
to take (after going east) or
things to get other than health
and ammo.

Go back to the room where you
found the map and exit through
the door in the back. You are a
some storage room. Go deeper
into the room, passing through
the hole in the wall and out the
door leading south.

There are crawlers in this
hallway. They seem to stay just
out of range of the buzzsaw, so
switch to the shotgun.

The path leading east will just
bring you back to the double
doors in front of Deuncil Drug,
so do not go that way. Turn to
the right (west) and through the
door.

There is nothing in either of
the restrooms, so just go
through the yellow door.

Looking at your map, there are
two exits to this room, one to
the east and one to the south,
go south.

Just ahead are some red double
doors marked Security and locked
with a keypad. You don't have
the combination, but a poem to
the right of the door reads:

A dead end is not what you've
found Instead a riddle you may
have missed Take some time to
look around Someone's office may
have the list

Ok, so this gives us a goal;
find an office and look for the
combination. Look at your map.
The map shows five offices on
the south east section of the
building. We're going to head
east down the hallway.

Towards the end, it will branch
off to the left, go straight
through the white door.

Don't bother with the wooden
door here, it is locked, just
keep going.

The path in front of you is
blocked, so head east. The
hallway is shaped like a
backwards "L." Round the corner
and head north until you see a
wooden door on the left, go in.

On a chair in front of you is a
note that reads:

1. Wooden Chairs
2. Paintings
3. Computer Monitor
4. Clock
5. Trash Cans
6. Newspaper Pages

Look around the room and count
how many you see of each item on
the list.

1. Wooden Chairs - 3
2. Paintings - 2
3. Computer Monitor - 1
4. Clock - 1
5. Trash Cans - 2
6. Newspaper Pages - 3

There's your code, 321123

Go back out into the hallway.
All other paths are locked or
blocked, so use your map and go
back to the security doors.
Enter the code then step through
the doors.

Head to the right and check the
cabinets. Booya! "Now I have a
machinegun. Ho ho ho." "Say
hello to my little friend!" (Two
Movie References)

Search the room for more
machinegun ammo, then exit the
room through either door heading
south.

You'll be in a hallway with some
worms. Deal with them as you see
fit then exit through the door
at the end of the hall.

The door to the left (north) is
locked so just keep going
through the wooden door.

Look at your map. The room on
the south east corner is locked,
so don't bother running over
there. Head north up the
hallway. If you need some
health, the double doors to the
right (east) leads to a blocked
off stairwell, but there are
some health pick ups here.

Continue north up the hallway
and exit through the white door.

All of the doors are locked. One
office to the right is open and
holds some shotgun ammo, only go
after it if you need it,
otherwise, just run to the
yellow door.

You are now in the Cafeteria.
Look at your map. The north exit
leads to a stairwell, that is
your destination. You can
explore the cafeteria if you
like but there is nothing to
find.

In the stairwell, the path up is
blocked, so obviously, go down.
Exit to the 4th floor.


________________________________

CHAPTER 8 - The Flashback


________________________________

Directly ahead of you is an old
gramophone, examine it. It seems
to still work.

The clean door to the left is
locked, so take the bloody door.

Here is a new enemy, a green
worm. There is nothing in this
room, so run across it to the
double doors.

This room doesn't have anything
either. Just make your way
through the mess of beds and out
the door on the other side.

The wooden door is locked, so
take the bloody door to the
left.

Take the first door on the left,
all others are locked or
blocked.

Watch out for the crawlers, then
exit the double doors.

Go down the hallway. On the
left, in a chair, is the
gramophone record, take it. Then
keep going past the chair and
around the corner to the left.
Step through the door.

Take out the crawlers then go
through the bloody door.

The door in front of you is
locked, so go out the right
door.

You are back in the room with
the beds, go right through the
double doors.

Run straight across the room and
through the doors.

Place the record on the
gramophone. Is this the
flashback? There is Jane Doe
again and the little girl. Just
what are we seeing here?

You can now go through the door
across from the gramophone.

BOSS 3 -

On the walls and ceiling are
mouth-like things that spew
forth worms. Attack each mouth
until it stops pulsating, it
will also not produce any more
worms. As you attack a mouth, it
will flash red. After you
destroy it, it will fade to
black.

Make your way around the area
attacking and destroying each
mouth and run from or fight off
the worms as necessary.

Try to take out the ones on the
ceiling first using your guns.
If you run out of ammo, the
buzzsaw cannot reach the mouths
on the ceiling and then you will
be stuck with no way to reach
them.

********************************

Grant O

Here's a simple way to get a
good start on the CHAPTER 8
boss. Its best that you first
have full health before
entering. Also, like the other
bosses don't hit them when they
flash red (otherwise it'll waste
amo). Use the machine gun and
then the shotgun (I found the
shotgun only takes 3 bullets to
kill each tree mouth), and then
need be the handgun (which I
only needed a few on the very
last mouth).

First stay in the corner where
the door is and take out the
tree mouth things that are
closest to you. This way,
obviously you won't have to
worry about a bunch of worms
coming up on you.

Next, take out every single
other tree thing that you can
see (even the furthest ones)
with your back at the door,
while killing any worm that
comes close (at this point you
can even kill them from a good
distance, while waiting for a
mouth to stop flashing red).
Just keep your back against the
door and stand there shooting at
the ones even in the far
distance with the machine gun.
They will still go dead after a
few each.

After that I managed to finish
the room going in a clockwise
direction. Although I just
barely managed to get through, I
had only lost one health dot
killing the first several with
the strategy I mentioned.

********************************



once the room is cleared, go
through the wooden door.

On a chair in front of you is
the 4th floor map. The only exit
from this room is in the south
east corner, step through the
door.

Round the corner to the right
and run straight for the wooden
door at the end of the hall.

Round the corner to the right.
The wooden door to the left is
an office with health and ammo.
From the hallway, head north
through the door. Keep following
the path until you reach an
intersetion.

There will be a door across from
a counter, the door will be
locked, so keep heading west.

In the room with the flying
bugs, the door leading south is
locked, so continue west.

Keep running west. there is
nothing in this room and no
other paths to take, head for
the skywalk.

There are two banshees on the
skywalk. You now have the means
and experience to deal with
these things. The door to the
north is locked, so go straight
across the skywalk.




________________________________

CHAPTER 9 - The Hole in the Wall


________________________________

The only available path is to
the right, so step through the
double doors.

Great, banshees in the hospital
now. Make your way across the
room through the other double
doors.

The door to the skywalk is
locked, so take the wooden door.

The room straight ahead and in
the alcove on the right leads to
an office, inside is the map.
There is also some health and
ammo in the restroom and closet.
Head back out into the lobby
area.

Go south down the hallway,
stopping in the other office for
some ammo, if you need it. Then
head south again through the
gray door.

Only go through the door on the
left heading east if you have
become good at killing banshees.
Two guard the corridor, of which
at the other end is ammo and
health, but that is all. You
really don't need to go that
way, so take the door to the
right (west).

Follow the hallway. It will lead
you to another hallway that goes
from east to west. Some of the
clipboards deviate from the
typical clinical diagnosis and
have more humorous conditions.
Search the rooms for pick-ups
and once you are done in this
hall, head out the double doors
to the west.

Follow the hall until it
intersects. On the wall, written
in blood is a message saying "If
You Dare." Approach the metal
box and examine it. Seems you
need something to improve your
grip. Apparently, this level
activates the door on the east.
So go through the door on the
west.

Follow the hallway north and go
through the door marked "staff
only."

In the closet to your immediate
left is a glove, take it then
return to the metal box. Move
the lever, then go through the
door.

The walls in this room generate
green worms. Consult your map to
orientate your self then exit
through the south door.

Ahead of you on the floor is a
.357 revolver! Don't miss that!

The only open path is to the
west, so go that way.

Head down the hallway. Look in
the closets for magnum ammo. At
the end of the hall, exit the
north door towards the
stairwell.

Go down the stairs and through
the door to the 3rd floor.



________________________________

CHAPTER 10 - The Torn Photograph


________________________________

Proceed down the hallway. The
rooms to your left all contain
pick-ups of a various nature,
grab what you need.

After turning the corner, at the
end of the hall are two doors,
one to the right and one to the
left. There is also a 3rd floor
map located on the counter top
between the doors. Once you are
finished here, take the west
doors.

Watch out for the banshee in
this hall, don't forget that the
buzzsaw can really even the odds
for you against those things.
There's nothing to be found here
so just go up the hallway and
exit the north door.

The way west is blocked, so head
east. Watch out for the green
worms, they're not ripe yet.
(Movie Reference) Turn your
light off before entering the
next room, there are flying
insects.

There is nothing to be had in
this room, so from the door, go
towards the left (east on the
map) and out the double white
doors.

There are a couple of Crawlers
in this hallway. All the of
doors are locked, so follow the
hallway to the northeast exit.

In this room the way south is
locked, so keep going east.

Oooo, that eerie laughter again.
There are a few pick-ups in this
room, once you have them, take
the south exit.

There are a few Freaks lying on
the floor. Take them out before
they can get up, then just keep
following the path.

There are two Crawlers in this
T-intersetion of a room and
nothing in either closet. The
north door is locked, so take
the south door.

On the floor straight ahead of
you is a flashing object, go see
what it is. It is the last piece
of the torn photo. Now we can
complete the picture.

Step into the elevator (same
hallway, east side) and activate
the panel, touching the flashing
button.


________________________________

CHAPTER 11 - The Guard Tower


________________________________

Follow the path and out the
double doors.

You are back in the courtyard.
Return to the church and place
the three picture pieces in the
book on the pulpit.

There is someone with their face
scratched out, Jane Doe, that
woman that dropped the key
earlier, and that little girl
you've been seeing. There is
also a date - 10/31/07. That is
the same date that was on your
clipboard outside of the room
you woke up in.

Leave the church. Back out in
the courtyard, turn right and go
around the corner. Go through
the gray door and up the stairs.

Once you reach the roof, try
entering the date in the keypad.
Bingo!

you are inside the guard tower.
To your right, past the dead guy
is the last weapon, the sniper
rifle!

You could have skipped ahead
earlier and looked here for the
code to get into the guard tower
and had the sniper rifle much
earlier and it may have even
helped you, but I didn't mention
it because that wasn't the
correct sequence of the game and
you would have robbed yourself
of the challenge of NOT having
the rifle.

Next time you play, remember
this. If you pick it up in
Chapter 5, then you will be able
to use it against the Gatlingun-
Wheelchair-Boss, which will make
that fight much easier.

Exit the tower out of the
opposite door that you entered.
Down the stairs and back into
the courtyard, then go to right
and take the elevator.



________________________________

CHAPTER 12 - The Cleaver's
Return


________________________________

BOSS 4

After the doors open, the
Cleaver will be coming straight
at you from down the hall. Whip
out the sniper rifle and tag
that fool in the head. Wait
until he stops flashing red
before shooting again as he is
not vulnerable when flashing. He
will again attempt to hit you
with the green whatever from his
syringe, just side step it. This
fight should be simpler than
before.

You may not want to hang out in
the elevator. The room you are
in makes a giant figure 8. Lure
the Clever towards you, then put
some distance between you and
keep tagging him. You will
probably run out of sniper ammo,
so be ready to fall back to one
of your other guns.


********************************

"I'm sure many have told you
this, but the thing is you do
not want to leave the elevator.
Back yourself as far as you can
into one of the corners. He'll
come teeth nashing close, but he
won't be able to attack you."

- Grant O

********************************

I have a tip or hint or whatever
you want to call it to help your
readers with the Cleaver the
second time around.

When you first get to him you'll
still be in the elevator. Move
back so your back is against the
far wall of the elevator, shine
your flashlight on the Cleaver
(without moving) and he will
start walking towards you.
Eventually he will get stuck in
the door of the elevator and
will not be able to hit you.
Switch to your shotgun and blow
his brains out with about 6-7
shots. Its real easy =D


- Sean.

********************************

You do want to stay in the back
of the evelevator

shine your flashlight on him(so
he won't shoot acid from the
needle) and wait for him to run
into the elevator

he can't attack you he just runs
in place because he is 2 big to
get into the elevator

stay in the back or he will cut
you with the butchers knife

just keep shooting him until he
dies he'll just run in place
while you shoot him eventully
he'll die

 - D W

********************************


After the fight, put the counter
to your left, then exit the door
at the end of the hall.

Keep going straight, the first
room has some health pick-ups,
then pass through the second
room. Follow the hallway, make
the right turn then through the
door.

There are banshees in this next
hall. The wooden door on your
right is an office with some
health and 9mmm ammo. Follow the
hall, it will make a right turn,
then come to a T-intersection.
Look to your right to find the
map! Now exit the south door.

There is some sniper ammo in the
wheel chair in front of you.
After snagging that, take the
east door.

Look at your map. The room you
are in is in the shape of a
backwards "L." The office in the
southeast corner has some
health. The doors to the
stairwell are locked, but the
office just north of the
stairwell has some magnum ammo.
Back in the hallway, turn off
your light then exit the door to
the north.

There are two offices off of
this hall but one is empty and
the other is blocked, so just
run past the bugs and through
the yellow door.

Run straight ahead and across
the cafeteria, taking out the
banshees as needed, then exit
the door to the north. In the
cafeteria, ignore the other
doors and don't look in the
kitchen. The kitchen is empty
and the middle doors leading
west is the long way to where
we're heading.

The path to the stairs is block,
so head west.

Keep going west (straight) and
into the Patient Ward.

Handle the three Crawlers, then
keep going west.

There's some health in the
foyer, after grabbing that, head
out to the skywalk.

Prepare to take out a couple of
banshees, then take the door to
the south. (The west door is
locked).

After passing through the
corridor running south, turn
back to the west. Watch for more
banshees.



________________________________

CHAPTER 13 - The Door with no
Handle


________________________________

Walk forward down the hall.
There will be a yellow door on
your right, ignore it for now.
Follow the path as it turns to
the left. Just ahead you will
see a box on the floor. After
examining the box, you see that
a special four letter word is
required to open it. There must
be a clue some where. Ah! there
is a piece of paper right beside
the box that reads:

It could be random
That might be true
But, I don't think so
It brought me to you

Hidden in the code
It's easy to see
Just remember that
Ten equals E

Ten equals E? The code on the
box is AULA. Hmmm, still doesn't
make sense, maybe there is
another clue somewhere. Search
the rest of this area to find
some pick-ups, then go back to
and through the yellow door.

All of the doors in this hallway
are locked, so just run to the
double doors at the end of the
hall.

To your left is a wooden door
and on it are scratched: 11, 6,
25, 10. Four numbers, four
letters for the special word.

In reality, five equals E but
according to the poem, Ten
equals E. So they added 5. In
reality one equals A, so add
five and six equals A. Seven
equals B, eight equals C and so
on.

11 would equal F
6  would equal A
25 would equal T
10 would equal E

Enter "FATE." Now you have the
door handle! Return to the
wooden door with the numbers
scrawled on it.

After watching the news story,
go across the room and through
the double doors.

Another surgery room, exit the
bloody double doors.

Fight your way to the door on
the right.

The wooden door is locked, so
take another right.

Kill the Crawlers, follow the
hallway, take the yellow door.

All of the doors in this hallway
are locked but one, take a right
down the branching hall and go
straight to the door at the end.

Does this receptionist area seem
especially bloody to you? Enter
the lounge through the double
doors.

Watch for the green worms. Skip
the doors to the left, they are
locked and go directly to the
doors across the room.

Directly across from you is the
lady's room, there is some
health in there, and one freak
as well. The hallway leads left,
watch for the flying insects.
Run past them and through the
door at the end of the hall.

Banshees. The hall leads to the
right, keep following it until
you can go left, then go through
the door.

The doors to your left and front
are both locked so head right,
all the way to the end of the
hall and through the door.

Bugs, mind the light. The door
left is locked, the path
straight is blocked, so go
right.

Take out the banshees and worms,
check the open rooms for pick-
ups, then exit the double doors
leading to the stairs.

Follow the stairs to the first
floor and step through the
doors.



________________________________

CHAPTER 14 - The Wheelchair's
Return


________________________________

In this first room, there are
pick-ups a-plenty. Raid the
place, turn your light off and
once you are ready step through
the metal door.

Don't move! Equip the sniper
rifle and get one good head
shot! He will run, er, roll off
after you hit him. Give chase!
Don't use your flashlight to
find him. Keep your distance and
look down the long hallways with
the sniper rifle. If he sees
your flashlight's beam, you give
away your position and he will
open fire.

As he runs, check each hallway
with the scope to see if he
stopped at the end. Once you
locate him, pop him in the head,
paint the walls with his brains.
(Movie Reference)

Keep up this pattern and do not
fire unless the reticule is red.
With about 8-10 shots, he will
fall. If you find that you don't
have enough sniper ammo, try to
sneak up on him from the side,
then pop out from around the
corner and unload on him with
whatever you have (Shotgun,
machinegun, magnum).

Once he falls, step through the
metal door.

Follow the hall, dealing with
the freaks as needed. The door
at the end of the hall is
locked, but just to the left is
an unlocked door.

Watch for the crawlers in this
hall. Follow the path and
through the door at the end.

Watch for the bugs, then take a
right and through the double
doors.

Another banshee hallway. Duck
into the side rooms for pick-ups
and cover. Run straight down the
hall, do not take the left. Both
doors lead to the same place,
but the left path is the longer
way.

There are crawlers in this area.
Follow the path, when it
branches, do not go left through
the double doors, that leads you
right back to the banshee
hallway. The hallway past the
right door is blocked, a dead
end, so go straight.

The first door to your left is
an office with flying bugs and
health. The other office on the
left is empty of any thing, so
once the path opens up, go to
the right. Step through the
wooden door with your gun/saw in
hand.

Quickly take out the freak then
go through the white double
doors on the right.

Run past the bugs and to the
double doors on the other side
of the room.

Up and to the left, take the
doors to the skywalk.

As you have probably guessed,
there are banshees out here. The
door to the left is locked, so
just keep running to the other
end.


________________________________

CHAPTER 15 - The First Encounter


________________________________


Proceed forward until you see
the counter, there is a map
waiting for you. Search the room
for pick-ups, just watch for the
bugs on the west side of the
room. Once you have all that you
need, exit the door on the west.

Get past the freak, then through
the door.

After killing the crawler, head
north.

Make your way through the very
linear maze, then exit the door
in the northwest corner.

Follow the path, again linear,
and head out of the north east
door.

The door to the stairs is
locked, so go right (south).

Prepare yourself for a banshee,
then proceed south.

Watch for the crawlers. The door
to the right (west) is locked,
so keep going south.

The west door is still locked,
so keep going south.

The first door to your right is
locked, as is the first office
to your left, the next office is
empty. Man-handle the freaks and
keep going south.

Mr. Redmoor? Is that you? Well
who was that guy in black? It
will all be over soon?

Look up ahead where that guy was
standing, a note. So the little
girl's name is Amanda. And so
maybe you didn't kill her Mommy,
Jane Doe.

After grabbing all of the pick-
ups you need out of this hall,
step through the door leading
east to the stairwell.

Follow the stairs down and
through the basement doors.


________________________________

CHAPTER 16 - The Final Encounter


________________________________


Ironic that you are in the
basement and no longer need the
flashlight. Follow the path. For
several rooms, it doesn't
deviate, no other paths to take.
You will eventually come to a
T-intersection. When you do, go
left.

Keep following the path. Like
before, it will remain linear
for many rooms. When you come to
another T-intersection it
doesn't matter which way you go.
It makes a circle that meets up
at the door to the path.

Keep following the path, dealing
with enemies as they come.
Again, it will stay straight for
a long time, then branch. This
next branch though is just
another circle path within the
room. Pick-ups line the floor.
Grab what you need, then step
through the door.

BOSS 6

Run and gun, run backwards that
is. Hit him whenever possible
but watch for when he flashes
red. Wait for the flashing to
stop before you fire at him
again or else you will just
waste ammo.

Periodically, he will use some
kind of ability to grab you. You
will know he is doing it when
you see white around the edges
of the screen. You can still
hurt him, but you cannot break
away from his grip.*

*I read on the Gamefaqs message
you, if you shoot his hands he
will release you.

I found that the sniper rifle
does the most damage to him
(head shots) but it might be a
bit tedious to set up the shot.

This is the last boss of the
game, there is no reason to
conserve ammo, so just hit him
with what you can and try to
keep your distance.


*****************************


Boss tip provided by: Arkrex

Anyway, regarding you strategy
for the final boss, it seems a
bit empty, so I thought I'd lend
you my fail-proof strategy.

Hit him up with the shotgun at a
distance, never letting him get
too close, nor too far away.
That way, when he eventually
tries to levitate you, you can
switch to the revolver and blast
away at his hands easily
(massive damage). Switch back to
the shotgun once he puts you
down again (the spread prevents
him from dodging the blasts) and
rinse and repeat until he's a
goner.


*****************************


Enjoy the ending.
