            3. STORY
--------------------------------

*** WARNING! ARIA OF SORROW PLOT

(taken from the game's
introduction)

Ever since the solar exlipse of
2035, my life has never been the
same. It was then that I
realized, I, Soma Cruz, am the
rebirth of Dracula... It was in
his castle that I learned the
truth... That I possessed the
power to seize the souls of my
enemies. That evil power almost
engulefed me, but my friends
pulled me from the brink. About
a year has passed since then,
and I thought my troubles were
over...

(in a city's streets)

Mina Hakuba: Ha ha! Are you
serious?

Soma Cruz: Yeah, and that's when
Hammer decided to-

Mina Hakuba: Wait... Soma, can I
ask you something?

Soma Cruz: Yeah, of course,
Mina. What's wrong?

Mina Hakuba: It's been a year
since it all happened, hasn't
it?

Soma Cruz: Yeah, just about.

Mina Hakuba: And what was it
called? You know, the ability to
use the power
   of monsters?

Soma Cruz: You mean the power of
dominance? I lost it when we
escaped
  Dracula's Castle, remember?

Mina Hakuba: I know, but... It's
just that I get this terrible
feeling
   inside...

Soma Cruz: It's probably
nothing... Look, don't worry,
okay? This past
  year, I haven't been able to u
  And-

(a woman appears)

Woman: You... You're Soma Cruz,
aren't you?

Soma Cruz: Uh... Yeah... And you
are?

Woman: You may call me Celia.
But not for long... Come forth,
my servants!

Soma Cruz: What?! Mina, get
back! Damn it! Of all the worst-

Man: Soma! You back off, too!

Mina Hakuba: Mr. Arikado!

Celia Fortner: Genya Arikado,
the guardian?! Hmph! You shall
not interfere!

Genya Arikado: A barrier! Quick,
Soma, use this!

(Arikado tosses Soma a knife.
Some fights and destroys a
Skeleton, Armor
 Knight, and a Golem.)

Celia Fortner: Soma Cruz, I
shall see your demise. That is
certain. Using
   whatever means...

(Celia disappears)

Soma Cruz: Wait!

Genya Arikado: Save your energy.
You won't catch her now.

Soma Cruz: Damn it!

Mina Hakuba: Soma, are you
alright?

Some Cruz: Yeah, I'm fine. But
that power... It returned!
Arikado, what's
  going on?

Genya Arikado: The power didn't
"return." It was always with
you. You just
   never had a need for it since
   set free all the souls you ga

Soma Cruz: You mean I couldn't
use the power because I was
never in any
  danger? Hmm. Anyway, who was t

Genya Arikado: Celia Fortner.
She's the priestess of a new and
rapidly
   growing cult. We suspected sh
   been keeping tabs on her.

Mina Hakuba: But why would
someone like that come after
Soma?

Genya Arikado: They want to
resurrect the lord of darkness.
Like some
   sought to do with Dracula.

Soma Cruz: I guess they don't
like the fact that I didn't
become the "lord
  of darkness."

Genya Arikado: Not only that,
they intend to create a new lord
by
   eliminating you.

Mina Hakuba: E-Eliminating?

Genya Arikado: But Soma, you
don't need to get any more
involved with this.
      Let us deal with it.

Soma Cruz: That woman... She
said she would "see my demise."

Mina Hakuba: Soma...

(Several days later...)

(Soma is outside the cult's
castle.)

Soma Cruz: So, the cult's base
is here. Hammer's info wasn't so
iffy after
  all.

Man: Gahaha! You doubted my
word?!

Soma Cruz: H-Hammer? What are
you doing here?

Hammer: What, are ya dense? Who
told ya 'bout this place? Wait,
it was me.

Soma Cruz: Well, yeah, but...

Hammer: Hey, you got your mind
on doin' somethin' wicked, huh?
I want in,
  buddy. And hey, what happened 
  remember, right?

Soma Cruz: You mean Yoko? She's
not coming. In fact, I haven't
told a soul.

Hammer: Huh? She ain't comin'?
Well, why not?! Aw, man... Well,
since I'm
  here, I'd better make the best
  and you're my customer!

Soma Cruz: Hammer, look, I'm
saying this for your own good.
You really
  should leave.

Hammer: Can't do that, I'm
afraid. I know when someone's in
trouble and I'm
 not just gonna leave ya here.

Soma Cruz: Okay... I appreciate
it.

Hammer: I'll scope out the area
and find a spot to set up shop.
See ya
  around! (to himself) Man, why 
  this...?

Soma Cruz: ...

         6. WALKTHROUGH
--------------------------------

      I. The Lost Village


You begin the game in the Lost
Village with a knife, and three
souls: Skeleton, Armor Knight,
and Golem. Equip these, and move
on through the next two rooms,
fighting the Skeletons, Bats,
and Peeping Eye along the way.
In the next room, pick up the
Short Sword and equip it.
Continue right.

Watch out for the Wargs and Axe
Armors in the next room. There
are some Zombies, too. In the
next room, there is a short
cutscene with you, Yoko
Belnades, and Julius Belmont.
Yoko will give you your first
magic seal; she'll describe them
to you. If you need to practice
any of the magic seals, pause
the game, go to Magic Seal, then
select the one you want to
practice.

Yoko will then follow you. Head
back to the room where you found
the short sword. Go down to the
bottom. To your right is a Save
Room. I suggest you save. Then
head left, and your first boss
battle will begin.

   -----------------------------
   ///          Boss: Flying Arm
   -----------------------------

This boss shouldn't give you any
trouble. You'll typically be
level 3 when you fight him, and
that is plenty enough. When he
spins his swords around, just
avoid him. He'll also have his
swords come flying towards the
center of the screen from both
sides; simply jump over them to
dodge this attack. He'll also
shoot his swords directly at
you. When this happens, again,
simply run away from them. After
you defeat him, you'll have to
draw Magic Seal 1, the one that
looks like a V, and he'll be
gone for good. You'll get his
soul, which reduces the speed of
falling. Grab the health he
drops after the short
conversation with Yoko and head
left.

With the Flying Armor soul
equipped, jump and in the middle
of your jump, hold R to float a
little longer than normal so you
can get to the next room. You'll
also pick up a Claymore sword.
This sword is more powerful than
your short sword, but it's
attack is somewhat slower. Equip
whichever you prefer and head
left.

In the next area, if you jump
across the three platforms,
you'll get a Spear. You'll
notice theres a room to your
left, but you can't reach it
because there is a barrier in
the way. Make note of where that
is, though, because that is a
Warp Room. Go into the room
directly below the Warp Room.

Defeat the Ouiji Table in here
and grab the Mace. Then stand as
far to the left of the room as
you can and drop down (if you
don't know how, it's Down+B at
the same time.). The room to
your left is a Save Room. After
saving, head right, grab the
$1000, and go right.

You'll be back outside again.
Drop down and head left; this is
where Yoko ran off to. She'll
describe to you how she can fuse
souls to weapons, thereby making
them better. After you're done
talking to her, head right,
through the next room.

This is Hammer's Shop. At
various points in the game,
he'll get more and more items
for you to use, but the weapons
he sells aren't the best you can
get. The best ones are fused
with souls in Yoko's place.

Anyway, after you've talked to
Hammer, head to the room above
his shop. There is only some
Zombies and an Ouiji Table in
this room, and you pick up
$1000. Go right.

You'll be in another outside
area. If you go down and to the
right and through the few rooms,
you'll pick up a Cape. This is
an accessory that just adds 2
points to your defense. You
could sell it if you want, too.

Back in the area outside, theres
a Potion above the entrance to
the area with the cape. Above
that is the room you need to go
to. To reach the door, jump up
the platforms near the door on
the left side of the room, and
use the Flying Armor soul to
cross the gap. Once across, head
inside. There's a couple student
witches you should take care of,
then exit through the door in
the upper right side of the
room.

This room is just full of
candles. Break 'em, and grab the
money, and continue to the
right.

in this room, the right exit is
blocked off; just hit the switch
next to the door by hitting it
with your weapon and continue
right.

Watch out for the Spin Devil in
this room, and head right,
through the door.

      II. The Wizardry Lab

Immediately when you enter this
room, note that there is a save
room directly below you on the
left side of the room. Across
from the save room is a room
which has a treasure chest with
money inside it, and a Blunt
Sword. Go back to the shaft and
head down it. There is a door at
the bottom of the room to your
left; enter it.

There are many different enemies
in this room, but one of note is
the Skeleton Archer. If you have
the patience, you may want to
enter and exit the room and kill
him until you get his soul,
because it will help you a LOT
in a boss battle later on in the
game. It's your choice, though,
of course. There are also some
Slimes, two Axe Armors, and a
Student Witch. Head out on the
left side of the room.

You'll emerge in another shaft.
Go down, and enter the first
door on your right.

There's 2 Manticores in this
room. Kill them, and move on to
the next room. It's (surprise!)
another shaft. Directly across
from you is your first warp
room. Enter it and activate it
by pressing up on the D pad. You
can now warp back and forth
between here and the Lost
Village warp room. This will
come in handy if you ever need
to buy potions or upgrade your
weapons. Go back to the shaft,
and head down. Enter the door on
your right.

Fight your way through to the
bottom of this room, and head
left. Watch out for The Creature
(the one that looks like
Frankenstein), because he can
take quite a few hits to kill.
He moves slowly though, so you
should be alright.

You'll come into another tall
room. Head to the bottom of it
and go right.

Cutscene time! Yay! You'll meet
the Dario and Dmitrii, the
candidates for the new dark
lord. After the cutscene, go
right.

At the bottom of this room,
there are two exits; the one to
the right is a save room, and
the one to the left is a boss
fight. Guess which one you
should enter first. After saving
(duh), go fight the boss.

   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Balore
   -----------------------------

This boss can be kinda tough.
Since you are still somewhat
weak, you should concentrate on
dodging his attacks, and
settling in for a long[er]
battle. His face is his weak
point. He has a few different
attacks. He will throw a punch
that sweeps along the floor of
the room... to dodge this, jump
over it. He'll also do an
uppercut punch, and you dodge
this by running to the right.
You'll know he'll do the
uppercut punch when he pulls his
fist in really close to himself.
He also punches horizontally
across the center of the room,
and you can dodge this by simply
not jumping when he does it. He
usually follows up with a low
sweeping punch after this. When
you see his eye flash purple,
get on the floor and DUCK,
because he shoots a laser beam
at you and it does a lot of
damage. When he isn't moving it,
you can stand on top of his
fist. You should be alright
against this boss if you are
about level 8-10 or above.

After you kill him, you'll gain
the ability to destroy the blue
blocks that look like ice that
you walked over when you entered
the boss room. On your way out,
you have to break the blocks.
Touch the blocks you want to
destroy with your finger or the
stylus, then leave the room. You
should probably save.

Head back to the room where you
saw Dario, Dmitrii, and Celia.
There is a Golem in the room
now. Defeat it, and continue on.

Go to the top of the room you're
in now, and head right. Kill the
Creature, and go to the top of
the room and exit on the left.

Go to the top of this room and
exit to the right.

You'll enter the room with the
Slaughters and the Student
Witches. Go to the top right
exit of this room.

You'll see some blocks that are
breakable, but don't break them.
Jump on them instead and jump
onto the platform. It will begin
moving to the right. While
ducking, hold the stylus on your
screen in front of Soma so the
blocks will be destroyed as you
move, so you can continue on. If
you fall, head back to the left,
and exit and re-enter the room
and the platform will be back to
where it was before. Then exit
on the right side of the room.

Continue right, and you'll enter
a new area: the Garden of
Madness.

     III. Garden of Madness

You'll enter the Garden in a
tall room. Kill the Skelerang's
as you climb; they can hit you
from almost anywhere in the room
with their boomerangs. The first
room on your left is a save
room. After saving, climb to the
top of the room and head left.

At this point in the game, the
Treant in the next room will
take quite a few hits to kill.
When it brings its foot back,
that means its going to kick you
(Bet you didn't see that one
coming, huh?) Just move out of
the way of it so you don't take
a lot of damage. At the far left
end of the room is the second
Magic Seal. Grab it, of course.
Then head up.

The exit to your left as you
enter the room is the Garden's
warp room, so activate it and
then head up. There are
Corpseweed here, and they only
suck because you might think
they are an Une, and only take
one hit to kill, but they
actually take two or three. So,
be careful you don't
accidentially step on one.

In the next room, you'll notice
a Breastplate on top of a pillar
to your right. Jump on the
broken pillar next to it and
then jump up to grab the armor.
Jump to the platform with the
Skeleton Ape on it (they are the
ones that throw the barrels) and
continue right.

Kill the Catoblepas here and
continue right. Take care that
he doesn't breathe on you,
because it will cause
petrification and if you are hit
while petrified, you will take a
lot more damage than usual.

At the top of this room is a
candle with a soul inside it -
break it and you'll receive the
Doppelganger soul, which allows
you to switch equipment and
souls on the fly simply by
pressing X. Leave through the
door on the right. This room
also has a Skeleton Farmer in
it, so if you are collecting all
the souls, I believe this is the
only place you can find him.

Continue going right through
this room, and look out for the
Yorick kicking his head around.
It's easy to forget about him
and take some cheap damage.
Before leaving this room to the
right, you'll notice a gun on a
ledge above you - but you can't
get it yet. Continue right into
the Dark Chapel.

        IV. Dark Chapel

As soon as you walk into the
Dark Chapel, some Mini Devils
will begin to attack you and
make that funny noise they make.
The best way to kill them is to
wait until they begin to attack,
then leap up and hit them as
many times as you can before
they shoot. Head to the right of
this room and you will find a
save room. After saving, head to
the upper right exit.

Watch out for the Ghouls here;
they may just look like Zombies,
but if you touch these, you will
get poisoned. Theres also a
witch here, but if you don't
jump in this room, she shouldn't
see you and you can move on.
Head right.

This room has some Ghost Dancers
and Amalaric Snipers. Don't
bother with the Ghost Dancers if
you can, but you'll probably
want to kill the Amalaric
Snipers. There's a potion in the
upper right of this room that
you can reach using the Flying
Armor soul. The door directly
beneath where you entered this
room is a Warp Room, so be sure
to activate it. Head to the
upper left exit.

There are two Great Armors in
this room. They can suck if you
don't kill them fast, and that
can be somewhat tough as early
in the game as it is. The
Skeleton soul seems to work okay
here, if you throw bones at the
Great Armor constantly and dodge
it's attacks. When it winds up,
run away. Another good way to
kill these things is to equip a
heavier weapon if you haven't
already. I prefer the quick
weapons for the majority of the
time, but whatever is easier to
use for you is obviously what
you should use.

After killing the Great Armors,
head left. You'll see a flying
enemy, a Valkyrie, so kill it
and continue.

When you emerge in the next
room, you'll see a platform
moving up. There is a good item
up there, but you can't reach it
yet, so head right, avoiding the
Ghosts and the Witch.

Head up and to the left of this
shaft and you'll find a save
room. Save, because at the
bottom right of the shaft is the
next boss you have to fight.


   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Dmitri
   -----------------------------

You'll be fighting one of the
dark lord's candidates in this
battle, Dmitrii. He can be easy
or hard, depending on what souls
you have. If you have the
Student Witch soul, use it on
him immediately, because Dmitrii
copies your Bullet Soul attacks,
and the Student Witch soul is
very, very easy to dodge. You
may want to use your Skeleton
soul, too, because his default
attack is hard to dodge and odes
a lot of damage. DO NOT use a
Guardian type soul on him,
because he will begin to use it
and it will not go away. Fight
this battle with your weapons.
Quick weapons work well against
Dmitrii. If you choose not to
use any of your souls, then
you'll have to dodge his Malphas
attack(the attack he absorbed
from the enemy in the cutscene
you saw before the fight). To do
this, you have no choice but to
jump over it, but he usually
sends out many of these attacks
in succession, so it becomes
quite difficult to dodge them.
If you get caught in the middle
of the attack, you will be
unable to move and you will take
more and more damage until the
attack is over. The best way to
kill him is by hitting him with
the Skeleton soul. If you do
that, all he will do is throw
bones at you like a Skeleton
does, so just stay as close as
you can to him, and duck and hit
him with your sword. Repeat this
until he is dead. You'll
probably want to be about level
14 or 15 at this point.

After you beat him, he'll die,
and you'll apparantly gain
dominance over his soul,
although you don't gain any
powers from him. Go back and
save before you continue right,
because there is another boss
battle coming up already.

After saving, continue right
through Dmitrii's room, and
watch out for the Quetzalcoatl
there. The best way to kill this
enemy is to duck and wait, and
hit its head as it bounces over
you. Try to stay away from the
edges of the room as you fight
him, because he'll bounce off
the walls and be much harder to
predict.

In the next room, the boss room
is the only exit to the upper
left.


   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Malpha
   -----------------------------

This battle can be tough.
Malphas has three attacks: the
black balls, the bats, and the
feathers. You'll know which I'm
referring to when you see them
for yourself. Dodge the black
balls by standing somewhat far
from Malphas and then, at the
last moment, jumping over them.
Stick close to Malphas unless it
does any of the attacks besides
the feathers, because it is
pretty much impossible to dodge
this attack unless you're
directly underneath Malphas. For
the bats, you will know Malphas
will do that attack when it
turns to the right or left and
moves back a little. To dodge
this, move to the opposite side
that Malphas is facing. Wack
away at Malphas until it dies.

After you defeat Malphas, you'll
get the Double Jump ability!
Yay, finally! Using this, you
can get the Hoop Earring off to
the right in the room before
Malphas room by double jumping
and using the Flying Armor soul.
Go back to the save point and
save.

Head back towards the warp point
in the Dark Chapel. You'll be
able to get the Power Belt item
in the room with the moving
platform by double jumping to
it. You should probably equip it
to add a point to your attack
and defense.

You'll pass through the Valkyrie
room and the Great Armor room
again. Then you'll be back in
the room with the Ghost Dancers.
Head to the Warp Room. This
would be a good time to go back
to the Lost Village and pay a
visit to Hammer (and Yoko, if
you have enough souls) to
upgrade your weapons and
whatnot. When your done, warp to
the Garden of Madness.

      V. Garden of Madness

From the Warp Room, head up.

In the room you are in now, head
to the upper right exit. There
should be a Catoblepas in the
next room. Forget about him and
climb the room, and leave
through the upper left door.
Kill the Corpseweed and Une, and
then head down.

After killing a Catoblepas,
you'll find a treasure chest
with money inside and a Fleuret.
This is a good fast weapon, so
if you like it and it boosts
your attack, equip it, then go
back to where you entered this
room.

Climb the broken pillar and
double jump onto the platform
above. Head right after that,
killing the Skeleton Apes along
the way.

In the next room, there is a
Mollusca. If you touch this or
get hit by it, you will be
poisoned, so either double jump
over it or attack its eyes.
Either way, head right.

The next room has 2 Treants and
a Barbariccia. Kill them and
head to the right, where you'll
find a save point. After saving,
head up in the room with the
Treants. You'll emerge in a room
with a Rycuda, and another boss
battle in the next room to your
left.

   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Dario 
   -----------------------------


Dario has these attacks: He'll
shoot a fireball, cause three
pillars of fire to rise from the
ground, cause a shockwave to run
along the ground, and he'll
teleport around. To dodge the
fireball, jump over it. This
attack is incredibly fast and is
hard to dodge, but if you just
time your attacks right you
won't be near Dario when he
shoots a fireball. As for the
three pillars of flame, the
first one will start where you
are standing, and the second one
will start where you are
standing shortly after the first
one starts, and then a third
will start in between the two.
You will know that this attack
will start when he holds both
his hands in the air and laughs,
and he starts to glow faintly
red. The best way to dodge this
attack is to let the first one
start, then move just outside
its range, and let the second
one start, then run away from
it, so the third one (and the
overall area of the attack) is
very small. Use the time when
these pillars are burning to use
some soul attacks on Dario, if
you have ones that can reach
him. (I'll use the Skeleton soul
as an example. If you make the
width of the pillars small
enough, you should be able to
jump up and hit Dario with a
bone. For the shockwave, simply
jump over it. The best way to
defeat Dario is to let him
attack, then get one or two hits
in, then wait for his next
attack and repeat until he's
dead. You'll probably want to be
between levels 17 and 20 for
this fight.

After you beat him, a short
cutscene will ensue. Obviously,
you aren't going to gain a power
from him, but you should go back
to the save room and save really
quick. After that, head back
through Darios room.

Watch out for the Skelerangs,
and head up and to the left. You
will emerge in the Demon Guest
House.

     VI. Demon Guest House

The first room here is a long
corridor. In it are Persephone,
of whom you can get quite a few
hits on before they are actually
able to attack - remember that
when they scream, get away from
them as they are about to attack
you. Head left.

In the next room, Genya Arikado
will catch up to you. He'll give
you a Talisman from Mina. See
the Endings section for more
information on what to do with
this Talisman. After this, head
left.

From where you are, if you head
down, the first room on the
right will be a save point. So,
save. The big room has Ghost
Dancers in it again, and there
is also some Lilith enemies.
Don't let them attach themselves
to you, as they will drain lots
of your HP and you won't be able
to attack them until you shake
them off. Head to the room
directly to the left of the save
room.

In this room there is a Lilith
and some Bone Towers. Kill them,
and continue left.

The next room contains one of
the few puzzles in the game.
There is a button in the next
room, and when you press it, 16
squares light up and you gain
control over the cursor. When
you press the A or Y button on a
square next to the empty square,
it will move itself into that
square. The way it is set up
will let you go to where you
need to, but there are some
items hidden within the rooms
that aren't accessible until you
move the rooms around a little.
Here is what is in which room:

Room 1: Cestus
Room 2: nothing
Room 3: nothing
Room 4: nothing
Room 5: Cutall
Room 6: nothing
Room 7: nothing
Room 8: Turquoise Stud
Room 9: Justaucorps
Room 10: nothing
Room 11: nothing
Room 12: Great Sword
Room 13: nothing
Room 14: nothing
Room 15: nothing

Now, notice the arrows pointing
in four directions in the room
with the switch. There is one
blinking, indicating you are
there. The other three represent
the exits to the maze. The upper
right one is where you need to
go to continue with the rest of
the game, whereas the lower left
one takes you back to the Lost
Village. The upper right one
contains a Ring Mail. When you
are done here, you can hit Reset
and then head towards the upper
left exit.

Watch out for the Killer Dolls
in the next room. If they touch
you, you will be cursed, and the
curse will drain all your MP
really fast. To get it back,
you'll have to wait for it to
wear off, then use items (which
I don't recommend) or wait for
it to recharge, or save your
game. Head up and to the right
and enter the next room.

There is a Killer Clown near the
entrance to this room. Kill it
and exit through the upper right
door.

In this room, stay in the upper
portion of it and exit through
the upper right door.

If you drop down in this room,
you'll get a High Potion. Grab
it, and then continue to the top
and left of this room.

In the next room, enter the door
directly above you.

Climb this room to the top, and
exit to the left.

This room can be a little
tricky. Theres a Quetzalcoatl
bouncing around in here, and a
Lilith and two Killer Clowns and
a Buer. The room in the upper
left exit of this room contains
the next Magic Seal, so be sure
to grab it. After you get it,
head to the top exit of the room
with the Quetzalcoatl in it.

There is a save point to your
right, so save before you go
fight the next boss.


   -----------------------------
   ///          Boss: Puppet Mas
   -----------------------------

This boss can hurt you in three
ways. You can run into him, get
hit by his flying puppets, or
you can be turned into a puppet
and stuffed into one of his iron
maidens. Obviously, just run
away from the flying puppets,
and wack away at him in the
meantime. When you hear him
start to make wierd noises, look
at his hands and find the
blue/grey puppet and hit it
until its dead. If you don't,
you will switch places with it
and take a massive amount of
damage. Other than that, just
beat at his head. It would be
good to be about level 20-23 for
this boss.

After you defeat him, you'll
gain his ability which allows
you to throw puppets and switch
places with them. Obviously, it
won't damage you when you do it.
Ever see those tiny holes you
can't fit through with what
looks like a dead puppet on the
other side? That is where you
use this ability. Throw the
puppet through the hole, and
you'll be on the other side.

After you fight this boss, the
game becomes a little less
linear. You have a choice to
make right now: head to the
Condemned Tower and destroy
Gergoth, or head to the
Subterranean Hell and fight
Rahab? Since I think the easier
path lies in fighting Rahab
first, that is the way I will
describe to you.

So, save. Then head to the room
with the Quetzalcoatl, and go
through the bottom right door.

From this room, exit to the
bottom left.

Cross this room and exit to the
bottom left again. You might run
into the devil near the top of
the room. He's not too tough,
you just have to concentrate on
him and dodge his attacks, and
throw in some attacks of your
own to take him down.

The room you'll enter is the
warp room for the Demon Guest
House. Since in this FAQ you'll
be fighting Rahab first, you'll
want to warp to the Dark Chapel.

From the warp room, head down
and to the bottom left exit,
past the Creature.

In the next room, there are
Ghouls and a Hell Boar. Avoid
the Ghouls so you don't get
poisoned. The Hell Boar is
similar to its Slaughterer
counterpart, only it has an
uppercut attack rather than a
punch, and it shoots its
fireball horizontally. So, kill
it and move on.

Head to the bottom of this room
and exit to the left.

In the next room, enter the
middle exit, or in other words,
right below where you entered
the room.

WATCH OUT for the spikes on the
ceiling! They do a lot of
damage. Let them fall, then
quickly move out of the way and
wait for them to rise again and
continue on your way. This is
where you need to use your
Puppet Master soul. On the other
side of the wall is a Catoblepas
and a Guillotine. Kill them and
watch out for the Barbariccia
and another set of spikes before
you leave the room.

     VII. Subterranean Hell

You will emerge in the
Subterranean Hell. Immediately
kill the Dead Pirate, head down,
kill the other one, and then
head right into the save room
and save. Then head to the upper
right exit.

Watch out for the Cave Troll,
then prepare yourself for
another boss fight.

   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Rahab 
   -----------------------------

I found this boss somewhat easy,
but that means nothing to you,
doesn't it? Anyway, since you
can't swim underwater yet, there
will be a lot of time spent in
this battle waiting for Rahab to
enter your area of attack. He
has these attacks: He'll jump in
the air drop icicles which you
dodge by swimming out of the
way. He'll also come up, and
spit ice at you which creates
platforms. This is a good
oppurtunity to attack. He'll
also destroy the platforms he
creates, so don't bother
standing on them. There's no
reason anyway. Just relax, and
hit him as much as you can and
dodge his attacks. You should be
about level 25 for an easy
battle. Anything above 20 will
probably do just fine.

After you beat him, you will
gain the ability to swim
underwater. As always, go save
before you continue.

Since you've beaten Rahab, you
don't need to go further in the
Subtereanean Hell yet. Warp to
the Dark Chapel.

     VIII. Dark Chapel (2)

In the big room with the Ghost
Dancers in it, right after the
warp point, exit through the
upper left door.

In the next room, get rid of the
Great Armors and head left.

After the Valkryie, head up to
the next room.

Head to the upper right exit of
this room.

Save in the upper left exit of
this room before heading through
the door directly across from
the save point.

Watch out for the Tombstone in
this hallway, and continue
right.

You'll emerge in a room with
three bells. Get rid of the Mini
Devils if you have to, then
equip the Puppet Master soul and
throw it through the little hole
and continue right.

You'll emerge in a big room.
Right off the bat there will be
some Valkryies and some Mini
Devils. Kill them as you need
to, and head to the right.
You'll see a sword on a platform
above you. If you try to double
jump, you won't reach it, but
if, at the height of your double
jump, you throw a puppet, the
puppet will land right next to
the sword and you will switch
places with it. So, pick up the
Kotetsu and head down. There
will be a Quetzalcoatl, so you
should probably take it out,
then head left. Directly left of
the Quetzalcoatl is a UMA News
3-2, so, if you want that, grab
it. Head down from there. Head
left, and drop down to the
bottom of this room. Head to the
right, drop down, and press the
switch to open the door. The
door will remain open for the
rest of the game now. After
that, head right. Kill the
Tombstone and then go through
the door.


      IX. Condemned Tower

You'll emerge in the Condemned
Tower. Head right. You have to
go through a long area with
quite a bit of enemies before a
save point, so play smart.

The next room has a Draghignazzo
in it. He has the same attack as
Barbariccia, just with a
different color scheme, and he
does more damage. Go right from
here.

The next room is empty. Continue
right.

Grab the Mind Up to the right,
and go through that door for a
cutscene. After the cutscene, go
back to the previous room and
head up. (Oh, and just a quick
note - you can't open the
barrier yet. You need to beat a
whole bunch of bosses and
whatnot first.) At the top of
this room is a Silver Stud. Exit
through the upper left door.

Woo hoo! It's my least favorite
enemy in the game, the Disc
Armor. This thing can do a bunch
of damage to you if you're not
careful. I just double jump over
him because I don't think its
worth it to fight him, but if
you can beat him without taking
any damage, then good for you.
Anyway, head left from this
room.

More Disc Armors! Do what you
can as you climb this room. If
you feel like killing them, do
so; if not, just go fast.

The next room has a Fleaman in
it. Not very dangerous, just
hard to hit. Continue right.

There is another Draghignazzo in
this room, but its the only
enemy. You'll have to climb to
the top of this room, then drop
down to head to the next room to
the left.

The next room has two Fleamen in
it. Kill them and move on.

The first enemy you'll see in
this room is a Skeleton Ape. The
next enemy you'll notice is a
Great Axe Armor. Above him is an
Estoc - which does decent
damage. Grab it if you want,
then continue right. Oh, and one
more thing - if you need to
level up quickly and have the
Imp soul, use it and hit the
Great Axe Armor. Then leave the
room, and quickly enter and hit
the Great Axe Armor again. If
the Imp soul is activated, it
will kill it in one hit. Repeat
this until you are out of MP for
some easy, easy and fast EXP
points.

There is a Werewolf in the next
room. He can be somewhat tough,
but just do this if you want to
kill him: Hit him once or twice,
then let him do an attack, dodge
it, then hit him once or twice
again. After he is dead, head
up, but watch out for the
Skeleton Ape, as it is quite
hard to dodge his barrel if you
don't know its coming. Continue
above him, then exit to the
left.

The next room has a Buer in it.
Kill it before it turns around
and rushes at you, then continue
left.

The next room has a Buer again,
this time on the slanted ground,
so watch out. Head up, and go
left. You'll notice a door on
the left side of this room, but
you can't reach it because
another door is in your way.
Remember where this is, because
after you beat the boss, this is
where you'll need to go. So
continue climbing the tower and
head right.

This room contains another Great
Axe Armor. The best place to
hide when he does his attack is
RIGHT next to him while ducking.
Kill him and continue right.

The next room has two Fleamen,
but just ignore them and go to
the top. You'll notice the boss
door to the left, but the room
to the right is a save room. I
SUGGEST YOU SAVE, as this next
boss is, in my opinion, the
hardest in the game. If you need
to level up for him, remember
that Great Axe Armors give you
300 EXP points per kill.

   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Gergot
   -----------------------------

You're definitely going to want
to be at least level 28 or above
for this sucker. The reason he
is so tough is because he almost
fills up the screen, thereby
making it hard for you to dodge
his attacks. I suggest you stock
up on Potions, too. Equip
something that can attack over
your head, such as and Axe or
Great Sword. He has a few
different attacks: he'll jump at
you, breathe
poisonous/petrifying breath,
shoot a beam at you, and suck
air in and chomp down on you. It
is very, very tough to dodge all
of these attacks, although of
the four, the two breath attacks
are the easiest to dodge. When
he sticks his chest out, run
away from him and wait for the
breath to disappear. For the
jump, you'll have to time it
right and run under him when he
does it. This is tough, and I
usually take a hit, so when your
HP gets low, use a Potion.
You'll know that he is about to
jump if he backs all the way up
to the wall and crouches down.
When you see a ball start to
form at his mouth, he is about
to shoot the beam at you, so go
crouch down by his feet and pray
you don't get hit. When he sucks
air in, if hes not close to a
wall, go over to it and wait for
him to chomp down to begin your
attack. If he is too close to a
wall, if you time a double jump
right, you'll dodge the attack.
About midway through the battle,
he'll scream, jump, and the
floor will break. You and he
will drop down to the bottom of
the tower, and resume your
fight. When he lands, his head
will be momentarily stuck in the
floor, so take this oppurtunity
for some free shots. Just don't
take to long, because when he
gets up, you'll get hit by his
head if you are too close. Then
the battle resumes as before,
except he will be slightly
faster. The Skeleton Archer
soul, when used by holding R and
releasing after charging for a
while, will do a lot of damage
to Gergoth. Use it wisely,
though, because it takes a while
to charge up and you'll have
wasted a lot of MP if you get
hit while charging it.


After you defeat him, you'll get
his soul, which actually is just
a sweet attack for you. It
doesn't allow you to go anywhere
you couldn't before. But anyway,
be sure to grab the health he
drops, and climb the tower
again. Because of your battle,
all the rooms in the middle of
the tower have no floors, so use
the Flying Armor soul and double
jumps to get to the top. Once
there, save, and then cross the
room where you started fighting
Gergoth. You'll find a Tower
Key. Go into the next room and
activate the warp, then go back
and save. Remember where that
room was with the locked door i
told you about earlier? Go back
there (its in the middle of the
tower, on the left side, if you
forgot) and touch the door to
unlock it. Continue left.

     X. Cursed Clock Tower

You will emerge in the Cursed
Clock Tower. A cutscene will
ensue in the hallway. Continue
left.

This area has a lot of
platforming elements. Be careful
to not get hit too much, because
there are lots of spikes all
over the place. In this room,
don't go down, just go directly
across. Use the Flying Armor
soul if you have to.

The next room has a bunch of
pistons going up and down with
spikes on the ceiling. Here's
how to pass this room: you'll
notice that some pistons have
blood on them, and others don't.
The ones with blood will go all
the way up to the spikes,
whereas if you stood on the ones
that don't have blood and
ducked, you would not touch the
spikes. So, for the first set of
pistons, go to the third piston,
duck, wait for it to go up, then
when you can, run across the
rest of the pistons to safety.
For the next set, you'll want to
duck on the first piston, then
run to the last one. Duck on
this one, then keep going.

In the next room, wait at the
entrance for a yellow platform
to come. Jump on it, and ride it
to the top of the room, dodging
the annoying Medusa Heads on the
way. Watch out for the yellow
Medusa Heads, because they will
petrify you if they touch you.
Anyway, exit to the upper right
area of the room.

The next room sucks. Make sure
the Puppet Master soul is
equipped, then prepare to dodge
a bunch of spinning spikes. You
have to time it right; I can't
really tell you how to get
through them. Once you get to
the top platform, use the Puppet
Master soul at the right time to
get past the spikes. Go up to
the next room.

This room has Imps and four
swinging pendulums in it. Kill
the Imps, then climb the
pendulums to the top - it might
take a few tries, because the
timing is wierd. Go to the upper
right exit in this room.

In the next room is a Bugbear,
and the next Magic Seal. Grab
it, and continue going right.

In the next room, you'll want to
take the upper left exit. Climb
the gears to do this.

After that, you'll emerge in a
room with a ton of spikes.
You'll have to slide under them,
twice (push Down and B to
slide). Then, your going to head
up and to the right. Dodge the
Slime and Tanjelly and exit to
the right.

This room can kinda suck. You
don't have to ride the platform
all the way around to climb it -
you can actually stand on the
bird thing sticking out from the
wall and then jump to the gear.
Exit to the top left.

This is the HUGE pendulum room.
Kill the Imps if you have to,
and then get on top of the
enormous swinging pendulum. Your
exit is right above where you
entered, so you'll have to
double jump to get there.

The next room is the room before
the boss room. To the right is
the save room. If you have the
Mandragora soul, use it here,
and the little guy floating
around in the background will
give you his soul - he is the
Flying Humanoid. So, anyway,
save, then head to the boss.


   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Zephyr
   -----------------------------

Zephyr has quite a few attacks,
but if you know how to dodge
them, you shouldn't have a
problem with him. Sometimes
he'll jump onto the ceiling,
then jump down, and on the way
down he'll throw a knife at you.
You can either run out of the
way of the knife, or slide out
of the way. I found it easier to
slide. If you hit him enough,
he'll freeze time and then, when
it unfreezes, he'll slash at
you. When he does this, either
backdash or jump out of the way,
or both. It might help to hit
him a couple times, then wait
for him to attack, so you can
avoid this attack, because I
found it hard to dodge. Other
times, he'll freeze time, jump
over you, and throw daggers -
when time unfreezes, the daggers
will fall straight down.
Obviously, just stand in between
the daggers to not get hit.
Sometimes he'll just throw a
dagger at you. This is a fast
attack and is hard to dodge.
You'll probably want to equip a
weapon that you can swing fast
for this battle. I would say you
should be around level 30.

After you beat him, you'll
recieve his soul which allows
you to stop time. Go save as
always. Then head back to his
room, and head straight to the
left. You'll find the warp room
for the Cursed Clock Tower.

Now that you have the Zephyr
soul, you are ready to go back
to the Subterranean Hell. So
warp to the Dark Chapel, then
head back to the save room right
before you get to the room where
you fought Rahab.

   XI. Subterranean Hell (2)

From the save point, head up and
to the right.

Watch out for the Cave Troll,
and keep going right.

This room was where you fought
Rahab. Keep going right. (Note:
Notice that you can jump as many
times as you want underwater.
It's this games version of
swimming, basically.)

In the next room, watch out for
the Decarabia, and head to the
lower right exit. There are
Mermen and Fish Heads in this
room too, but they shouldn't
give you any trouble. There's
also a Mimic in the upper right
corner of the room.

Next, kill the Fish Heads in
your way, and don't touch the
Needles as you make your way to
the left. Be sure to grab the
High Mind Up on the ledge before
you do down a little and then
head right, through the Fish
Heads. Go down to the bottom of
the room and head left, out the
exit.

Slowly fall down the shaft,
dodging the Needles and killing
them as you need to. Get out of
the water and head left.

In the next room, you'll see a
little head floating around on
the water. That is a Procel - if
you get its soul (it's really
rare - three stars!), you'll get
one of the few Ability souls in
the game, which allows you to
move faster underwater. You
don't NEED it, per se, but it
can be helpful. Anyway, head
left.

In the next room is a Frozen
Shade - kill it, and head to the
upper left exit.

The next room has the only Alura
Une in the game. When the girl
in the plant bends down, that
means the stalks are about to
shoot up, so if your standing on
one, move out of the way. After
you kill the Alura Une, continue
left.

At the beginning of the next
area is a Dead Pirate. Kill it,
then head to the upper exit.

In the next room, kill the
Ukoback and head right.

The next room has Bone Arks in
it. Get its soul if you can,
it'll help you access an area
later. The far right exit of
this room is a save room. You're
probably somewhat low on health,
so you should save.

From the save point, head back
the way you came, to the room
with the Ukoback. Head down.

You'll see a Dead Pirate to your
left - ignore it and head right,
drop down to the bottom of the
room, and then head left.

The next room has a Dead Pirate
in it, kill it and enter the
room to the left. It is a warp
point. If you need more health,
you can warp from here to, say,
the Lost Village where you can
get to a save point with minimal
problems. Oh, and you can buy
stuff if you need it. Anyway,
after your ready, head down.

In the next room, go right, drop
down to the bottom of the room,
and head left. The treasure
chest that was behind the Frozen
Shade was a Mimic anyway.

The next room has another
Ukoback in it. Kill it, and
continue left.

Drop down to the bottom of this
room and go right, and you'll
find a save room. Head across
from the save room.

In the next room, grab the
Mushroom on your way down to the
next exit you need to go to,
which is the bottom right one.

In the next room, you'll be
offered two paths - take the
upper one, the one out of the
water, and kill the enemies and
head right.

In the next room, you'll see
something happen, and time
freeze. This is where you need
to use the Zephyr soul. Head
right afterwards.


      XII. Silenced Ruins

This room contains easy enemies,
like Ghouls, Peeping Eyes,
Skeletons, and Bats. Plow your
way through and exit to the
right.

The next room has various
Skeletons in it, ranging from
regular Skeletons, Skelerangs,
to Skeleton Archers. Head to the
exit in the middle of the room
to the right.

Kill the Gorgon in this room and
watch out for the Ghouls as
well, and head right.

In the next room, head to the
bottom, watch out for the Bone
Ark, then head to the top right
exit.

Cutscene! After you're done
talking to Julius, head right.

The room to the right of the
room you are in now is a save
room. Save! There is a boss
coming up. Head to the upper
right exit.

The next room has Skeletons,
Dead Crusaders, and Ghouls in
it. Take the path at the bottom
of the room to head right; it is
much easier than the top, as
there is a Dead Crusader up
there that you cannot jump over
due to the low ceiling. Next, is
a boss battle.

   -----------------------------
   ///           Boss: Bat Compa
   -----------------------------

A bunch of red bats come
together to from the relatively
easy boss that is Bat Company.
It has three attacks: it forms
to look like a bat, and makes
its way around the room to run
into you. To dodge this, stand
in one place and attack it, then
when it comes towards you, jump
over it to the other side. It
also forms a hand and tries to
grab you - don't let it, as this
can be devastating. It'll also
form some sort of a... thing...
that shoots little blue rings at
you. This one can be tough to
dodge, but note that you can
destroy the rings by hitting
them with your weapon or a soul.
If you can dodge his attacks,
you will have no problem beating
Bat Company. You'll probably
want to be around level 32-35 to
beat this boss.

After you beat him, you'll get
his soul, which allows you to
transform into a bat and fly
anywhere as long as you have MP.
Yay! Go save.

From the save point, head left
through the hallways until you
get to the bigger room where you
can go down. Go to the bottom of
this room, the room with the
Bone Ark in the middle, and go
right.

Watch out for the Larva flying
around, and head right. You'll
come to the Warp Room for the
Silenced Ruins. If you need
Potions or anything like that,
you can (obviously) warp back to
the Lost Village and buy them.

You have another option at this
point. As of right now, you can
get the crappy ending if you so
choose - you can go fight Dario
in the Pinnacle, or you can go
beat Paranoia and be well on
your way to getting the best
ending of the game. (If you just
go beat Dario, you'll miss a
huge section of the castle, as
well.) The rest of this guide
will tell you how to get the
best ending, so anyway, warp to
the Cursed Clock Tower.

  XIII. Cursed Clock Tower (2)

From the warp room, head right,
then down.

At the bottom of this room,
stand on the switch so the wall
to the right breaks. Head left
from here.

In the next room, you have to
get to the bottom without
getting hit by the spikes. Watch
out for the Medusa Heads, and
jump to the bottom left of the
room - it's OK, there aren't any
spikes there. Then head right.

Again, watch out for the Medusa
Heads and spikes as you drop to
the bottom of this room and head
left.

The next room is where you need
the Bat Company soul. Fly
through the spikes and exit to
the right.

There are no enemies in the next
room, but there are a ton of
spikes. Simply drop to the
bottom of the room, then slide
(again, Down +B) under the
spikes and head left.

There is a Devil in the next
room. I'll leave the option to
kill him up to you, but anyway,
head left.

There are a bunch of Harpies in
the next room. Kill them, and
head left to enter the Pinnacle.

       XIV. The Pinnacle

There is a Succubus in this
room. They will latch onto you
and suck your HP if you're not
careful, so don't get to close
to them. Kill her and move on.

In the next room, kill the
Bugbear and continue heading
left. You'll see some Malachi -
they can be tough, but you need
to kill them to continue. Head
left.

In the next room, immediately
drop down.

To the right is a save room.
Save, definitely, then head left
from the save point.

The next room contains a whole
bunch of Succubus in it. You can
either kill them, or kick cancel
(if you don't know how to do
that, it's simply jumping,
double jumping, then pressing
Down + B and landing on the top
of an enemy, and then repeating)
across them to get to the other
side. Exit to the left, of
course.

   XV. Demon Guest House (2)

You'll be back in the Demon
Guest House. Head to the left.

In the next room, hit the switch
to the left to enable you to
travel between the lower half of
the Demon Guest House and the
upper half.

You need to go to the middle
left room to go fight Paranoia.
A lot of people don't do this,
because you need 3 souls to
continue:

1. Axe Armor
2. Killer Clown
3. Ukoback

When you get these three souls,
you can move on. You can find
Axe Armors in many places,
namely, the Lost Village and
Wizardry Lab, and Killer Clowns
are all over the Demon Guest
House. Ukobacks can be found in
Subterranean Hell. When you get
these 3 souls, come back here
and use them on the walls with
their picture on it to continue.

Once you use them, you'll be
able to go into the next 2
rooms, the first of which is
empty and the second of which
begins the boss battle with
Paranoia.

   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Parano
   -----------------------------

This boss has 2 forms - a little
one, and a big one. The small
one will come out of the mirror,
and proceed to attack you with a
knife. Attack, then run, attack,
then run, repeat. Your hits do
not knock him back. After a
while, he'll go into the mirror
and then, using the little
mirrors in the four corners of
the screen, direct a laser that
bounces off all of them. To
dodge this attack, watch where
the mirrors point and then stand
(or jump, or fly with the Bat
Company soul) out of the way.
After he dies, you can go into
the next room. Go ahead, after
using a Potion if you need to.
This version of Paranoia is the
same as the last except that he
does more damage, and rather
than attack you with a knife,
he'll hover above you and then
come down at you fast. To dodge
this attack, wait until he
hovers directly above you, then
when he starts to come down on
you, run to away from him. He'll
also fire two lasers at you in a
row, rather than one. Besides
those, defeat him like you did
the small version and seal him.
You'll want to be about level 36
to 38 for this boss.

After you beat him, you'll gain
the ability to enter mirrors.
Any mirror you see you will be
able to enter, which will
usually allow you to get a new
item or something along those
lines. After you beat him, head
left to get Olrox's Suit - at
this point, for me, this was the
best piece of clothing for me to
equip, so it was pretty good.

Head right. There is a Mana
Prism in the mirror of the room
where you fought the little
Paranoia. Continue right, and
head back to the save point of
the Pinnacle.

       XVI. Pinnacle (2)

From the save point, head left.
Head up from this room.

The next room contains some Dead
Warriors and a Mushussu. Use the
same tactics you did against the
Mushussu as you did against the
Manticore. As for the Dead
Warriors, watch where they turn
around, then wait for them to
return and hit them, as you
stand safely out of the range of
their attack. Anyway, head left.

In the next room, head up,
killing the Guillotiners along
the way.

In the next room, head to the
right, past the Dead Crusader
and the Erinys and the Werewolf,
and out the east door.

In this room, head down, kill
the Guillotiner and the
Mushussu, and watch out for the
Alastor and head to the upper
right door. To kill the Alastor,
make sure all the other enemies
in the room are dead, then hit
the sword, and don't let it
attack you. There's also a Mana
Prism in the upper center of the
room.

In the next room, head to the
right, past the two pairs of
Dead Crusaders and Erinys. There
is a Spear on the ledge above
the door you need to exit.

Ignore the Werewolf in the next
room and head up.

Fly up from this room using the
Bat Company soul.

Head straight left from here,
ignoring the Werewolves on the
top ledge and ignoring the Fire
Demon if you so choose.

The next room has a bunch of
Dead Warriors in it. You can
either be patient and kill them
all, or take a risk and
jump/kick cancel past them. You
can also fly over them with the
Bat Company soul too. Either
way, exit to the left.

The next room is empty; to the
left is a save point. USE IT.

Fly up from the empty room.

Head left in this room, killing
the Bugbears in it. Try not to
wake them all up at once, as
this can be tough to deal with.
You need to save your energy for
the boss battle coming up.

The next room is just stairs.
Climb them and head left.

The next room is empty, but
there is a boss door to the
left. Enter it.


   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Aguni 
   -----------------------------

DO NOT FIGHT DARIO, unless you
want the bad ending. Stand in
front of the mirror in this room
and use the Paranoia soul, and
you will enter it and fight
Aguni, the fire demon. Here are
his attacks: he'll fly into the
air, and shortly he'll crash
into the ground where you are
standing, and send shockwaves
through it. To dodge this, when
he comes down at you, start
running, then jump over the
shockwaves. He'll also do three
swipes at you with his hand -
this can be tough to dodge. When
the first one starts, run in the
direction that you have more
room in, so you can dodge his
three swipes. He'll also shoot
fire a couple times that runs
along the ground, so make sure
you are not near a wall when he
does this, and use this as a
good time to attack him as you
jump over the fire. He'll also
fly around the room, but you can
dodge this if you simply duck.
You'll want to be at least level
40 for this boss. Since you have
it if you are fighting him, the
Axe Armor soul works well on
him.

After you beat him, exit the
mirror. Cutscene time!
Afterwards, head to the left to
get the final Magic Seal. It's a
complex one. Head to the save
point of course, then warp to
the Garden of Madness. There is
a warp point in the Pinnacle
below and to the left of the
first save room you entered in
the area. Just head to the
bottom of the shaft right next
to it, and head left. In the
next room, just head left past
the Erinys and the Dead Warrior
and you'll be in it.

  XVII. Garden of Madness (3)

From the warp point, head up.

In the next room, head to the
bottom right exit.

In the next room, kill the
Mollusca.

IMPORTANT! To unlock Julius
mode, do NOT equip the Talisman
that Mina gave you. Once the
game ends, it will save, and you
will still be able to open this
file, and equip the Talisman and
continue through the rest of the
game. Anyway, after you've
unlocked Julius Mode, equip
Mina's Talisman and enter the
boss door.

After the cutscene is done, head
back to the warp point and warp
to the Condemned Tower.


   XVIII. Condemned Tower (2)

From the warp room, drop down in
the center shaft to the very
bottom. Don't worry, you won't
get hurt. Head to the right for
two screens.

Now that the way is open, drop
down into the Mine of Judgement.

     XIX. Mine of Judgement

From the entrance, head left
until you cannot any more. There
is a save point here. After you
save, go to the right, and in
the room next to the entrance,
drop down to the bottom. Watch
out for the Tanjellys, as they
can Poison you. Head left.

In the next room, don't drop
down, just head left.

In this room, drop to the middle
and enter the first door you see
on the right.

In the next room, again, don't
drop down, just head right.

Watch out for the Tanjellys, and
head down in this room. The exit
to the left is the one you want.

Again, do not drop down in this
room, just head left.

More Tanjellys to watch out for.
Head to the middle right exit.

What are you not going to do in
this room? Drop down, that's
what. Head right.

Drop down and head left in the
middle exit.

Guess what to do in this room!
Can't? Don't drop down, and head
left.

In this room, head to the first
exit on the left. The room after
this is empty, and the room
after the empty one is a warp
room. Activate it, then head
back to the shaft and drop down
and go right.

This is getting annoying to
type. Don't drop down, head
right. There. I said it for the
last time.

In this room, watch out for the
Tanjellys, drop down to the
bottom, and head right. There is
a save point here.

AFTER SAVING, head left. There
will be an empty room, and then
a boss room.

   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Death 
   -----------------------------

Everybody's favorite staple
Castlevania boss is back! He's
tough, as usual, in this
incarnation, as well (especially
on Hard Mode). Death has two
parts, the first one gray, the
second one red. They are both
tough. 45 is a good level to be,
but if you can dodge his
attacks, you could do with a
lower level. Here are the
attacks of his first part: He'll
face you, come down, and swing
his scythe at you. Dodge this by
jumping, then landing and
ducking under his second swipe.
His scythe will also spin, then
he'll throw it and it'll break
into a bunch of pieces. Attack
the pieces and they will be
destroyed, then you can jump
through the hole in the pieces
you create. Without his scythe,
Death will sometimes start to
sparkle, then he'll summon three
copies of himself that shoot
laser beams down. To dodge this,
stand in between the laser
beams. He can get his scythe
back too. When he changes red,
his attacks change. He'll throw
his scythe, and little sickles
will fly around the screen
sometimes. To dodge this, either
run out of the way of the
scythe, or jump over it. Being a
bat could help as well. He'll
also try to swipe at you, and
I've found the best way to dodge
it is to jump over both of his
attacks. When Death shoots blue
beams to his side, pay attention
to the order they come out in -
big heads will come from those
sides of the screens and will
bite at you. To dodge these,
stop attacking Death and run in
the opposite direction of the
head right before it bites down,
then, before the other one
appears, turn around and run
towards where the first head
came from. Repeat this until the
attack ends. You can also fly
with the Bat Company soul to
avoid this attack altogether,
but this uses up a lot of MP you
could be using on attacks. The
Axe Armor soul, which I know you
have, works pretty well on
Death. You should be about level
42 or above to beat Death.

After you beat him, go save.
Then head left and enter the
door after Death's room to enter
the final area of the game, the
Abyss.

         XX. The Abyss

Don't worry, you can always go
back to the regular castle from
the Abyss by using the door you
entered it in, or by the warp
room at the very end of it.
Anyway, drop down from the room
you are in now.

Head left and use the save room.

There are really tough enemies
in the Abyss, and not many save
points - so perhaps some Potions
would be in order. There is an
Arc Demon in this room, and do
NOT stand above the glowing red
floor in any of the rooms, as
they shoot fire and it does a
lot of damage, and can
potentially trap you, allowing
other enemies to hit you. Watch
out for the fire pillar in the
right of this room, and drop
down.

There is a fire pillar that goes
through the floors in this room,
so watch out. Drop down, and
kill the annoying Rippers. After
the Rippers, there are two Flame
Demons and two more fire
pillars. Kill the Flame Demons
and move on.

The next two rooms are empty.
Continue left.

The next room has sinking sand
and Alastors in it. The Alastors
can be tough to fight in this
situation, so fight the first
one right where it appears, then
head down and fight the second
one.

In the next room, kill the
Erinys and sink all the way to
the bottom of the sinking sand.
You'll find a lamp you can break
to get the Hippogryph soul! This
is really useful (especially
against the last boss), as you
can press up and L to jump
really freaking high at no MP
cost! Anyway, head up.

Watch out for the Heart Eater in
this room, as it flies around
really fast. Head left, mind the
Mud Demon, then drop down.

Ignore the Mud Demons in this
room, and just wait for them to
disappear for you to continue
on. Drop down from this room.

The next room is empty. Head
right.

The next room is also empty.
Drop down.

Kill the two Frozen Shades in
this room, ignore the third one,
and head left and drop down.

There is an Erinys and a Stolas
in this room. The Stolas can
take a while to kill, and in the
meantime can summon various
monsters. I suggest you jump/fly
over both of these enemies, and
exit the room as fast as
possible.

The next room contains just a
Final Guard. You have a couple
options here. You can either
kill it, and move on, or fly
over it with your Bat Company
soul. Do either, and drop down
to the next room.

Kill the Malachi as fast as
possible, then work on the White
Dragons next. Kill the next
Malachi and then head right.

The next room is empty. Head
right.

The next room is also empty.
Head right.

There is a Malacoda in this
room. Kill it, drop down, go
around, and head right.

Mind the Erinys and the Mud
Demon in this room, then head to
the save room before the boss
battle.

   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Abaddo
   -----------------------------
I had a lot of trouble with this
boss. He'll jump around the
room, and summon locusts to
swarm over you and take damage.
I used the Gergoth soul here to
destroy the locusts in many of
his attacks, and then refilled
my MP with potions. You'll know
which way the locusts will come
by the direction he waves his
baton in. If he swings it
completely straight, they will
come in a straight line; if he
makes a U, they will come in
that shape, if he swipes over
his head then down, they'll come
in that shape, etc. For all but
the last one, the Gergoth soul
works perfectly. I've been told
that the Final Guard soul works
as well, but most people that
aren't collecting souls won't
have it. For the U shape, you
can use the Hippogryph soul
repeatedly to stay towards the
ceiling. For the straight line
attack, use Gergoth.So, work on
dodging his attacks, and
whacking him in between, and
you'll beat him soon. I
recommend you be around level 42
or above again.

After you beat him, definitely
go back and save, then continue.

There are two empty rooms after
Abaddon. Go through them.

The next room has Malacodas and
a Black Panther in it. The Black
Panther soul is very, very
useful, so I suggest you try to
get it. It makes you go really
fast, and barely uses any MP.
Head up into the next room.

Ignore the Stolas and head up.
He might summon a lot of Erinys,
so you may have to kill them to
continue.

The next room has an Iron Golem
in it. You will always, no
matter the weapon, do one damage
to the Iron Golem unless you
have the Dead Crusader soul on,
and attack him from the back, in
which case you will always do 2
damage. He has 50 HP... so
either kill him, or fly over him
with the Bat Company soul. There
is also a Black Panther behind
him. Head up from this room.

Don't get on the platfrom with
the Giant Slug until you kill
him. Just hit him from beneath
and then continue up.

The next room is empty. Head
left.

The next room is also empty.
Head up.

The next room has an Erinys and
a Tanjelly in it. Kill them
both, while dodging the spikes,
and head up.

Kill the White Dragon and the
Succubus, then head right.
You'll activate the warp room
for the Abyss. Head up from
here.

To the right of this empty room
is the last save point in the
game. Save! You are about to
fight the last boss! Yay! Head
left from the save point, and
enter the door to fight the last
boss.

   -----------------------------
   ///              Boss: Menace
   -----------------------------

The last boss! After the
cutscene, the battle will begin.
The first part of Menace is
fairly easy. All you have to do
is dodge the spikes by running
to the right if they come from
above, or running to the center
if they come from below. When he
opens his mouth, run to the
right to get out of the way of
his breath. Hit the tiny head
sticking out from his chest
until it blows up to get to the
second part. Be patient; this
first part is easy, so don't
waste any of your potions or MP
refillers on this. Just use your
weapon to attack him. The second
part is another matter entirely.
He will stand up and walk around
the enormous room, swinging at
you whenever you get too close.
You will need to destroy the
face on his knee and the one in
his mouth to beat him. That
would be easy, but the problem
is the little traingle things
with teeth that he sends out
that hunt you down. Dodging
these is not easy, but you can
destroy them. The Black Panther
soul, if you have it, can help
escape damage fast in this
battle, and the Hippogryph soul
will help you jump up to attack
the face when you need to. Just
don't run into him, because
you'll probably get stuck and
he'll deal a ton of damage to
you. I recommend you be around
level 45 to beat him. And, once
you do, sit back and enjoy the
ending - you've beaten the game!
