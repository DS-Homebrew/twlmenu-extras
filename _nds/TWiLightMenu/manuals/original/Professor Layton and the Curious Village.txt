001-General Information
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a walkthrough for the Nintendo DS game called Professor 
Layton and the Curious Village. It's a puzzle/mystery game 
containing a lot of brainteasers.

Please note that this guide does not cover the Wi-fi puzzles you 
can get with this game, because I am currently unable to 
download the wi-fi puzzles for some reason. It worked when I 
first purchased this game, but it doesn't work now. Dang.

You can contact me at ilovecartoonssomuch@yahoo.com if you have 
any questions, suggestions or that sort of thing.

002-Video Walkthrough
-----------------------------------------------------------

I made a video walkthrough for this game, so if you would rather 
watch me solve various puzzles rather than read about them, you 
can see them all at:

http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=42DAED4CD1C0D33F

I will put the links to individual videos in the guide as well.

003-Walkthrough
-----------------------------------------------------------

Video #1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCDPzFH944A

The game begins with Professor Layton and his apprentice Luke 
driving to St. Mystere, where the Professor has been asked to 
help solve an inheritance dispute. It seems that Baron Augustus 
Reinhold left behind a will stating that his entire estate will 
go to the one who finds the Golden Apple.

This is quite a mysterious will, given that no one had ever 
heard of the Golden Apple before the will's reading. Could it be 
a treasure of some sort?

Lady Dahlia, Baron Reinhold's wife, has sent for Professor 
Layton to help solve the mystery. They just need to go to the 
town and...wait, what's this?

Puzzle #001: Where's the Town?
------------------------------

Lady Dahlia included a map, along with the instructions "My 
village is on a road that leads to no other towns." The 
instructions are on the top screen of the DS, and the map is on 
the bottom screen.

As you can see, there are four roads and five towns. Using your 
stylus, draw a circle around the correct town. Which town is 
that? Why, it's the town in the upper/left, the one with red 
roofs. Circle it and submit it as your answer.

-------

With the puzzle solved, Professor Layton and Luke make it to 
town, where they stare at the very odd tower at the north part 
of town.

Video #2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnflujF2vzs
	
The drawbridge to town is closed. Tap on the man who runs the 
drawbridge, Franco, to talk to him.

Puzzle #002: The Crank and the Slot
-----------------------------------
Location: Drawbridge
Character: Franco
--------------------

Summary: To solve this puzzle, figure out which slot fits the 
crank. Is it slot 1, 2 or 3? You can tap the crank to change the 
viewing angle to help you out.

Solution: See the two square parts sticking out of the crank? 
Slots 2 and 3 show that the side between the two of them is 
flat. However, the crank shows that there is actually a sharp 
angle between the two of them. Therefore, Slot 1 is the correct 
answer.

-------

Franco lowers the drawbridge and lets you into town. Now it's 
off to find Lady Dahlia! But first...let's explain the game's 
control scheme!

Click on the shoe in the bottom/right corner. Yellow arrows will 
appear. Click on the arrow to travel in that direction. A white 
glove appears in front of doors that you can enter through. You 
can also click on a person to talk to him or her.

Try it out now by tapping on the woman on the left.

Puzzle #003: Strange Hats
-------------------------
Location: Entrance
Character: Ingrid
------------------

Summary: You have four hats pictures here. Which hat is as wide 
as it is tall?

Solution: Hat A is the correct hat.

------

You can talk to the man here. He tells you to tap on the barrel 
for a hint coin. You can find hint coins hidden all over this 
game, and you can use them to get three hints on every puzzle. 
You're reading a guide with the answers to all the puzzles, so 
you shouldn't need them, and so, I do not list where all the 
hint coins are.

Head north, and the professor explains about the game's save 
system. Tap the briefcase in the upper/right corner to be taken 
to a screen where you can save your game, look up an index of 
all the puzzles you've seen, read a journal to get an overview 
of the plot, and read about the various mysteries in the game.

You can also solve the painting, gizmo and furniture meta-
puzzles here, but you don't learn about them quite yet. 
Basically, sometimes when you solve puzzles in this game, you 
will get a painting piece, gizmo, or piece of furniture as a 
reward. Collect them all, and at the end of the game, you can 
solve each of the meta-puzzles for bonus puzzles.

And now that you've gotten an idea of the control scheme, it's 
time for...

003a-Chapter One: Reinhold Manor Awaits
-----------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this chapter is to get to Reinhold Manor, which is 
in the northeast part of town.

Of course, along the way, you'll want to talk to everyone you 
meet in order to get a puzzle. In this game, pretty much 
everyone you talk to has a puzzle for you to solve.

For example, that man there! Percy! The town author! Tap on him 
to get...

Puzzle #004: Where's My House?
------------------------------
Location: Plaza
Character: Percy
----------------

Summary: Leave the front door of Percy's house and turn left. 
Take a right at the first intersection you meet, and a right at 
the next intersection you meet. You end up facing the morning 
sun. Which of the seven houses in the picture is the correct 
one?

Solution: The morning sun is in the east, so you can work 
backwards from there to figure it out. Alternately, you can use 
guess and check on every house--pick a house, follow the 
instructions and see if it results in facing east. You can also 
rule out a few houses that are facing the same direction, 
because taking the same route from those houses would result in 
facing the same direction, and there's only one solution, so 
when two houses both lead you to the same direction, they can be 
ruled out, right? Right.

Anyway, the answer is the house with the blue roof in the middle 
of the screen, the one that faces north.

------

Video #3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z0ZpTSUhnI

Ah, but it's not just talking to people that gives you puzzles! 
You can also find puzzles by examining things! For example, 
examine that clock tower there to get a puzzle.

Puzzle #005: Digital Digits
---------------------------
Location: Plaza
Examine: Clock Tower
----------------

Summary: Occasionally, a digital clock will show the same digit 
three or more times in a row, such as when it's 3:33. How many 
times does a digital clock do this over the course of one day?

Solution: There's not much to do to solve this puzzle besides 
make a list of all the times during the day when three or more 
digits appear in a row. Here's a list of all those times:

1:11 AM
2:22 AM
3:33 AM
4:44 AM
5:55 AM
10:00 AM
11:10 AM
11:11 AM
11:12 AM
11:13 AM
11:14 AM
11:15 AM
11:16 AM
11:17 AM
11:18 AM
11:19 AM
12:22 AM
1:11 PM
2:22 PM
3:33 PM
4:44 PM
5:55 PM
10:00 PM
11:10 PM
11:11 PM
11:12 PM
11:13 PM
11:14 PM
11:15 PM
11:16 PM
11:17 PM
11:18 PM
11:19 PM
12:22 PM

The list is made up of 24 different times, so the answer is 34.

---

Those are both the puzzles you can do on this screen, meaning 
there's not much left to do besides go right to the next screen. 
Do so, and the Professor and Luke see a man blocking the road. 
Tap on this man with your stylus to talk to him.

His name is Marco, and he gives you a puzzle to solve.

Puzzle #006: Light Weight
-------------------------
Location: Manor Road
Character: Marco
----------------

Summary: You have seven weights here that are all the same 
weight. You also have a weight that is rather light, but it 
looks exactly like the other weights. Can you figure out which 
weight is the light one by using a scale only twice?

Solution: The number of the light weight is randomly determined. 
You're going to have to use logic here. These instructions work 
well:

Place weights 1, 2 and 3 on the left-hand scale. Then place 
weights 4, 5 and 6 on the right-hand scale. Press the red button 
to weigh them.

If the left-hand scale goes up, you know the light weight is 
either 1, 2 or 3. Then, weigh 1 and 2. If 1 and 2 are the same 
weight, 3 is the light weight. If 1 and 2 are not the same 
weight, choose the one that is lighter.

If the right-hand scale goes up, you know the light weight is 
either 4, 5 or 6. Then, weigh 5 and 6. If 5 and 6 are the same 
weight, 4 is the light weight. If 5 and 6 are not the same 
weight, choose the one that is lighter.

If the left-hand scale is equal to the right-hand scale, then 
you know the light weight must be 7 or 8. Weigh the two of them 
to determine which is lighter.

---

Marco lets you pass. Now you can walk north towards the manor. 
Your path here is block by Ramon, a servant at the manor. He 
thinks Layton could be someone in disguise, so he asks Layton to 
solve a puzzle and thereby prove his identity.

In case you haven't figured it out yet, pretty much every 
character in this game has a puzzle for you to solve.

Puzzle #007: Wolves and Chicks
------------------------------
Location: Manor Border
Character: Ramon
----------------

Summary: You want to take three wolves and three chicks across a 
river. You have to take one or two animals with you when you 
cross the river, and if the wolves ever outnumber the chicks on 
one bank, they will eat the chicks. Can you get the animals 
across the river without allowing the wolves to eat the chicks?

Solution: There are multiple solutions, and you get as many 
tries as you need to solve the puzzle. My strategy is to start 
by getting the wolves on the right side of the river.

1. Take two wolves right.
2. Take one wolf left.
3. Take two wolves right.

Then you want to start moving all the chicks over. This will 
require having an equal amount of wolves and chicks on both 
sides.

4. Take one wolf left.
5. Take two chicks right.
6. Take a chick and a wolf left.

Now move two chicks right so all the chicks are on the right 
hand side.

7. Take two chicks right.

Now that all the chicks are on the right, you want just bring 
all the wolves right.

8. Take one wolf left.
9. Take two wolves right.
10. Take one wolf left.
11. Take two wolves right.

---

Ramon is pleased when you solve the puzzle, and he leaves. You 
can now walk towards the manor, but before that, tap on the 
flowers on the other side of the riverbank to get a puzzle.

Puzzle #008: Farm Work
----------------------
Location: Manor Border
Examine: Flowers
----------------

Summary: Alfred and Roland are being paid $100 to plow and sow a 
10-acre plot of land. Each boy will plow and sow half of the 
land. Alfred plows 20 minutes per acre, and Roland plows 40 
minutes per acre. Roland sows three times as fast as Alfred.

So, how much of the $100 should Roland receive?

Solution: Ha, this is a tricky puzzle. It tries to confuse you 
by giving you a bunch of unnecessary mathematical facts.

To put it simply, Alfred works on half the land, and Roland does 
the other half. Since each of them does half the work, each of 
them should receive half the money. The answer is $50.

---

Now head forward towards the manor. Luke is impressed by how 
large it is, and thus ends Chapter One.

003b-Chapter Two: The Fugitive Feline
-----------------------------------------------------------

Video #4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbKyoZZvunI

Professor Layton and Luke have arrived at Reinhold Manor. They 
go inside and meet Matthew, the butler. He says that everyone is 
waiting upstairs, but before you can join them, you must solve a 
matchstick puzzle. Matthew then explains the control scheme for 
matchstick puzzles.

Puzzle #009: One Poor Pooch
---------------------------
Location: Manor Entrance
Character: Matthew
------------------

Summary: Here's a picture of a dog. After the picture, the dog 
is hit by a car. Move two matchsticks to show what the dog looks 
like after it is hit by the car.

Solution: The game says not to assume you'll be looking at the 
dog from the side when the puzzle is done. That's your hint that 
tells you you'll be looking at the dog's flattened body from 
above.

Change the picture from
  __
/|  |__
\|__|
 /\ /\

to

 \__/
/|  |__
\|__|
 /  \

---

Examine the bookshelf for another puzzle.

Puzzle #010: Alphabet
---------------------
Location: Manor Foyer
Examine: Books
--------------

Summary: What's the last letter of the alphabet? Hint: It's not 
Z.

Solution: Tricky puzzle! It wants you to answer "t", which is 
the last letter in the word "alphabet".

---

While in the manor foyer, you can look at the paintings on the 
wall. One is of the late Baron Augustus Reinhold, and the other 
is of his daughter Flora.

When you look at the paintings (if you don't look at them now, 
later on, Layton will look at them automatically), Matthew gives 
you a painting frame. Throughout this game, when you solve 
certain puzzles, you get pieces of the painting that belongs in 
this frame. When you collect all twenty of them, you can put the 
painting together and get three bonus puzzles.

Go upstairs now to meet Baron Reinhold's wife, Lady Dahlia. A 
cutscene plays, where Professor Layton talks to Lady Dahlia. 
There is a mysterious crashing sound, and her cat escapes from 
the house.

Lady Dahlia becomes upset and demands that you search for her 
cat, Claudia by name. This will be the goal of Chapter Two--to 
find Claudia the Cat. You'll have to search throughout the 
entire town to find her, and so, you will get a basic idea of 
the town's layout while searching for Claudia.

You can talk to Simon, the man with glasses, for a puzzle.

Puzzle #011: Arc and Line
-------------------------
Location: Manor Parlor
Character: Simon
----------------

Summary: You have a mathematical puzzle, which requires some 
basic geometry skills to solve. How long is line AC?

Solution: Line AC is the same length as line BD, because ABCD is 
a rectangle, and the two diagonals of a rectangle are always the 
same length.

Now, you may notice that BD is a radius of the circle. The 
radius of the circle is ten inches (5 + 5), so BD must be 10 
inches as well. And since AC = BD, AC is 10 inches. The answer, 
therefore, is 10 inches.
 
---

Tap on the chandelier to get a hidden puzzle.

Puzzle #110: The Vanishing Cube
-------------------------------
Location: Manor Parlor
Examine: Chandelier
-------------------

Summary: You have a bunch of matchsticks here that form four 
cubes. Move one matchstick so you have only three cubes.

Solution: This requires three-dimensional thinking. See the cube 
in the middle/back? Only one side of this cube is showing. That 
means this is the cube that is going to "disappear".

Take the matchstick that forms the side of this cube, and rotate 
it so it is facing straight up and down. Then place it so it 
forms a side on the uppermost cube. It will connect the red end 
of two matches if you do this properly.

---

Now that you're done with the puzzles here, go outside.

Video #5: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3feXjYIaOrU

Hey, Claudia the Cat is here! Tap on her, and she runs off. 
Then, there's a minor scene in which a mysterious villain crash-
lands in town and declares his intent to get the treasure of 
Baron Reinhold and defeat Professor Layton! Uh oh!

The villain won't try to kill Layton for a while, though, so 
just forget about him for now and look for Claudia. Move back to 
the screen with Ramon, and you can click on the boat for a 
puzzle.

Puzzle #013: Sinking Ship
-------------------------
Location: Manor Parlor
Examine: Boat
-------------

Summary: Fifteen people are on a sinking ship. There is a five 
person raft onboard, and an island four and a half minutes away. 
How many people can make it to the island if the boat sinks in 
twenty minutes?

Solution: The trick to this puzzle is realizing that you'll need 
at least one person on the raft at all times.

So...

Minute 1: Five people get on the raft.
Minute 4 1/2: Four people land on the island. One takes the raft 
back to the ship.
Minute 9: Four people get on the raft.
Minute 13 1/2: Four people land on the island, making eight 
people on the island in total. One takes the raft back to the 
ship
Minute 18: Four people get on the raft.
Minute 20: Ship sinks. The eight people on the island and the 
five people on the raft are safe. Therefore, 13 people lived.

---

Go down a screen, to the screen with Marco. Here, you can go 
inside the building on the left by tapping on the door. Inside 
this abandoned store are two puzzles.

Puzzle #014: Which Chair?
-------------------------
Location: General Store
Examine: Chair
--------------

Summary: Which of the five chairs is good for an auditorium?

Solution: Chair E, because it is the only chair that is 
stackable. Humbug, I say. That's not much of a puzzle.

---

Puzzle #015: How Many Are Left?
-------------------------------
Location: General Store
Examine: Candle
---------------

Summary: Ten candles are lit. Some wind blows out three of the 
candles. How many candles are left in the end?

Solution: This puzzle is phrased in an attempt to confuse you. 
What it means by "how many candles are left in the end?" is "How 
many candles will NOT melt?". The answer is three--the ones that 
were blown out.

---

That's it for the general store. Leave, then go left to the 
clock tower area. Franco shows up and says someone stole the 
crank to the town, so no one can get in or out of town now. I 
bet that's the work of the mysterious villain!

Franco also found a weird gizmo, which he gives to you. From now 
on, people will give you gizmos when you solve certain puzzles. 
Collect all the gizmo pieces, open up the "Gizmo Puzzle" in 
Layton's trunk, then click on all the gizmo pieces you collected 
to get a robot dog.

Claudia the Cat is here. Tap on her, and Luke tries to calm her 
down. She attacks Luke. What a vicious cat!

There are a few buildings here at the Clock Tower, but the only 
one you can enter now is the Town Hall, which has a blue door. 
Inside is Rodney. Talk to him for a puzzle, and when you solve 
the puzzle, he gives you a gizmo. So, do that to see how getting 
gizmos works.

Puzzle #016: Triangles and Ink
------------------------------
Location: Town Hall
Character: Rodney
-----------------

Summary: There's a big triangle made up of little triangles. 
With one dip in ink, you can make four little triangles. How 
many dips of ink does it take to draw the big triangle?

Solution: Seven.

---

Tap on the window on the right for a hidden puzzle. 

Puzzle #118: Red and Black Cards
--------------------------------
Location: Town Hall
Examine: Windows
----------------

Summary: A deck of cards is shuffled, then cut in half. If you 
do this 1000 times, how many times will the number of black 
cards in Pile A equal to the number of red cards in Pile B?

Solution: Math! Fun math, too. Let's say Pile B has x black 
cards. That means Pile A, then, must have 26-x black cards 
(because there are 26 black cards in total).

As for red cards, Pile B has 26-x red cards (because there are 
26 cards in Pile B in total). So, the number of red cards in 
Pile B = the number of black cards in Pile A. Aha! The number of 
red cards in one pile always equals the number of black cards in 
the other pile!

So, if you do this trick 1000 times, the conditions will be met 
1000 times. Cool!

---

Video #6: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3nOTQfjTN4

Leave the town hall. If you talk to Deke, he tells you Claudia 
went left. However, Professor Layton suggests taking a detour to 
the south to get a room at the inn.

So, go south. Talk to Stachenscarfen here for a puzzle.

Puzzle #017: Five-Card Shuffle
------------------------------
Location: Entrance
Character: Stachenscarfen
-------------------------

Summary: Which one of the four pictures is different than the 
others?

Solution: D is the one that is different.

---

Now, go inside the Inn, which is the building with the blue 
door. Talk to the woman there, Beatrice, to get the Furniture 
Puzzle. It's sort of like the Gizmo puzzle. From now on, 
whenever you solve certain puzzles, you get pieces of furniture. 
Get all the pieces of furniture and solve a furniture puzzle to 
get three bonus puzzles! You won't be able to do that for quite 
some time, however.

Beatrice also has a puzzle for you.

Puzzle #018: Of Dust and Dustpan
--------------------------------
Location: Inn
Character: Beatrice
-------------------

Summary: Move two matches to make it so the dustpan is holding 
the dust.

Solution: You have to turn the dustpan upside-down to solve this 
one. Move the rightmost match to the left of the dust. Then, 
move the middle match (the only match that is horizontal) to the 
left a little to connect the two lower matches. See how the 
dustpan is now upside-down?

---

There is a hidden puzzle in the picture behind Beatrice.

Puzzle #112: My Beloved
-----------------------
Location: Inn
Examine: Picture
----------------

Summary: Arrange the pieces of this picture so they form a 
picture of "My Beloved".

Solution: If you think of the pieces of the picture like this:

A B
C D

Switch C and B, then C and A.

C A
B D

Rotate A twice, then rotate D twice. The black outline sort of 
looks like a woman, and that's the solution.

---

Leave the Inn and go south. If you tap on the Laytonmobile, you 
get a puzzle.

Puzzle #019: Parking Lot Gridlock
---------------------------------
Location: Drawbridge
Examine: Laytonmobile
---------------------

Summary: Slide the cars out of the way so the Laytonmobile can 
exit!

Solution:

1. Move the second-from-the-top car right.
2. Move the car right of the Laytonmobile up.
3. Move the car right of the Laytonmobile up.
4. Move the Laytonmobile right.
5. Move the bottom/left car up.
6. Move the bottommost car left.
7. Move the second-from-the-bottom car left.
8. Move the second-from-the-left car down.
9. Move the Laytonmobile left.
10. Move the topmost car down.
11. Move the second-from-the top car left.
12. Move the topmost car left.
13. Move the rightmost car up.
14. Move the car right of the Laytonmobile up.
15. Move the Laytonmobile right.

---

Okay, let's get back to searching for Claudia! Go north twice, 
then left. The woman here, Agnes, knows how to get on Claudia's 
good side: offer her some food.

But, of course, Agnes won't give you the food unless you solve a 
puzzle.

Puzzle #022: Pigpen Partitions
------------------------------
Location: Park Road
Character: Agnes
----------------

Summary: Draw three lines to separate the seven pigs.

Solution: Okay, see the pig in the bottom middle and the pig in 
the top middle? One line starts from the peg left of the pig in 
the bottom middle, and stops on the peg right of the pig on the 
top middle.

Another line starts from the peg right of the pig in the bottom 
middle, and stops on the peg two left of the pig on the top 
middle.

The third line starts on the peg below the pig in the 
upper/left, and stops on the peg below the pig on the 
upper/right.

---

Agnes gives you fish bones for Claudia. You can now go north to 
give the fish bones to Claudia and end the chapter if you want, 
but there are a few puzzles left in this chapter. Three of them 
are on this screen.

Video #7: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9XKH7_cS44

Puzzle #020: Unfriendly Neighbors
---------------------------------
Location: Park Road
Character: Pauly
----------------

Summary: Draw four lines between the four sets of numbers. Just 
make sure that none of the lines overlap.

Solution: The line between the two B's is a straight up/down 
line. The D line goes left from the left D, up to the top of the 
screen and to the right. The line from the right D goes left 
once, up to the top of the screen and left. The two will 
connect.

The C line goes right from the left C, and it goes all the way 
right, then up, then right and goes into the C. The A line goes 
down, right, down, left, down, right and up--basically, it goes 
along the only empty spot left for it.

Puzzle #021: Pill Prescription
------------------------------
Location: Park Road
Character: Pauly
----------------

Summary: A dude man has to take ten pills, and he has to label 
them in the order he will take them. What's the least number of 
pills he has to label?

Solution: If he labels all the pills except one, he can always 
identify it as the unlabeled one. For example, if he decides not 
to label Pill 5, he will always know which pill is Pill 5--it's 
the only one without a label.

So the solution is that he can get away without labeling one 
pill, but the puzzle assumes that he doesn't have to label the 
first pill either, because he'll swallow it before doing any 
labeling. I don't know HOW he knows which pill is Pill 1 if he 
doesn't do any labeling, but that's the puzzle solution anyway.

Puzzle #111: Mystery Item
-------------------------
Location: Park Road
Examine: Poster
---------------

Summary: What is...something that you need to live, something 
that people keep in their houses AND something that decreases in 
quantity the longer it's kept?

Solution: Food. Move a matchstick on the leftmost box to spell 
out the word "Food" and submit it as your answer.

---

Go inside the blue door building to the right, which is the 
local restaurant. Both the characters here have puzzles.

Puzzle #025: Equilateral Triangle
---------------------------------
Location: Restaurant
Character: Flick
----------------

Summary: Can you move this triangle:

   X
  X X
 X X X
X X X X

Upside down by only moving three X's?

Solution: Yes! Move coins 1, 2 and 3:

   1
  X X
 X X X
2 X X 3

To these spots:
   
2 X X 3
 X X X
  X X
   1

Puzzle #023: Juice Pitchers
---------------------------
Location: Restaurant
Character: Crouton
------------------

Summary: Crouton has an eight-quart container of juice, a five-
quart container and a three-quart container. Can you move the 
juice between the three containers until you get four quarts in 
one jar?

Solution: Crouton has a few puzzles that involve separating 
liquids in uneven containers. The solution to these puzzles is 
generally these four steps:

1. Big jar to middle jar
2. Middle jar to small jar
3. Small jar to big jar
4. Middle jar to small jar

Just repeat the four steps until you get the desired amount of 
liquid. In this case, it takes seven turns.

---

Once you solve the puzzles here, go outside and go north. 
Claudia the Cat is here, and she'll come with you if you got 
fish bones from Agnes (puzzle #22). Before you do that, check 
out the garbage. Professor Layton will be reminded of a puzzle, 
because pretty much _everything_ reminds the Professor of a 
puzzle.

Puzzle #026: Bottle Full of Germs
---------------------------------
Location: Park Gate
Examine: Garbage
----------------

Summary: You have a breed of germ that divides in half every 
minute. If you start with 1 germ, the jar becomes full in 60 
minutes. If you start with 2 germs, the jar becomes full in how 
many minutes?

Solution: The 1 germ becomes 2 germs after 1 minute...so 
starting with 2 germs only shaves 1 minute off the total. 60 – 1 
= 59, so the answer is 59 minutes.

---

Good, once you're done with the puzzle, NOW you can pick up 
Claudia and end the chapter.

003c-Chapter Three: The Missing Servant
-----------------------------------------------------------

The game tells you that if you missed any puzzles in the last 
chapter, they will now appear in Granny Riddleton's Shack near 
the clock tower.

Video #8: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHH3PkMzmtY

Professor Layton and Luke return to the mansion with Claudia, 
but there's no time for celebrating. Something really bad has 
happened--Simon (the man with glasses) has just been killed!

Fortunately, Inspector Chelmey from London is on the case! Now, 
talk to Matthew and Gordon for puzzles and plot advancement.

Puzzle #027: Bickering Brothers
-------------------------------
Location: Manor Foyer
Character: Gordon
-----------------

Summary: Six brothers are sitting at a table. Brothers 3 and 5 
can't sit next to each other, and no brother sits next to 
someone a year older or younger than he is.

Solution: Place the brothers like this:

  1
5   3
2   6
  4

Puzzle #028: Find the Dot
-------------------------
Location: Manor Parlor
Character: Matthew
------------------

Summary: You have a strange shape with a red dot and black dot 
on it. When you turn it around, where will the black dot be?

Solution: The lower/right corner.

---

Matthew tells you that he found a mysterious small cog on the 
ground at the scene of the crime.

Chelmey returns after you talk to Gordon and Matthew. He becomes 
concerned that Ramon isn't here, and so he puts Ramon at the top 
of his suspect list.

The Professor can then go into Lady Dahlia's room. She gives you 
the mission of finding Ramon while Chelmey inspects the crime 
scene. Chapter Three officially begins here.

Inside Lady Dahlia's room is a picture of her holding a baby. 
Leave the room and ask her about it to learn that she's never 
had a baby in her life. How odd.

Video #9: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlQcYomeFJo

Inspector Chelmey here has a puzzle for you.

Puzzle #029: Five Suspects
--------------------------
Location: Manor Parlor
Character: Chelmey
------------------

Summary: Five people were arrested, and each gave a statement.

A: One of us is lying.
B: Two of us are lying.
C: Three of us are lying.
D: Four of us are lying.
E: All five of us are lying.

How many people are telling the truth?

Solution: Only one of them is telling the truth: Person D. You 
know this is the case, because all five disagree, so no more 
than one can be telling the truth.

---

Head downstairs and talk to Matthew. He says that the picture of 
the woman with the baby is really Lady Violet with Flora 
Reinhold. How curious that she looks so much like Lady Dahlia!

Head outside, and our heroes see Claudia with Simon's glasses. 
That could be an important clue! They inform Inspector Chelmey 
about the glasses, but he just gets mad at the Professor for 
interrupting his investigation.

As Luke points out, Inspector Chelmey is kind of rude. Oh well. 
It's best to forget about him for now, and just start looking 
for Ramon.

Outside of the manor, Agnes is waiting with a puzzle.

Puzzle #030: One Line Puzzle 1
------------------------------
Location: Manor Border
Character: Agnes
----------------

Summary: Which of the four pictures can't be drawn with only a 
single stroke of the pen?

Solution: The cottage.

---

Leave the manor grounds now, and talk to Marco. He tells you to 
avoid the mysterious tower. If you talk to him again, he gives 
you a puzzle.

Puzzle #031: Racetrack Riddle
-----------------------------
Location: Manor Road
Character: Marco
----------------

Summary: We have three horses here.

Horse A runs two laps in a minute.
Horse B runs three laps in a minute.
Horse C runs four laps in a minute.

If you line up all three horses and set them running on the same 
racetrack at the same time, how long will it be before they're 
all lined up at the starting line again?

Solution: One minute, clearly.
 
---

Head inside the abandoned general store now. This will be the 
last time you visit the general store in this game. Examine the 
candle and the candy jar for puzzles.

Puzzle #033: Light Which One?
-----------------------------
Location: General Store
Examine: Candle
---------------

Summary: You have one match. You want to light a room with an 
oil lamp, fireplace and heat your bathwater. In order to do this 
successfully, what do you light first?

Solution: The match!

Puzzle #032: Candy Jars
-----------------------
Location: General Store
Examine: Candy Jar
------------------

Summary: You have 10 jars with 50 pieces of candy each. You pour 
out the candy into bags. Now, you have 20 bags full of candy.

You want to have an average of 25 pieces of candy per bag. What 
is the percentage of this happening?

Solution: 100% -- this happens 100% of the time. Basically, you 
need to know the mathematical concept of "average", or else you 
probably won't be able to solve this puzzle.

---

Video #10: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxuqjXl5glE

Leave the General Store (forever), then go to the left to the 
plaza where the clock tower is. Percy warns the Professor and 
Luke to stay away from the mysterious tower. He also gives you a 
puzzle.

Puzzle #034: How Many Sheets?
-----------------------------
Location: Plaza
Character: Percy
----------------

Summary: There's a picture of several sheets of paper. How many 
sheets of paper are overlapping at the place where the most 
sheets overlap?

Solution: Five.

---

Tap on the building right of Percy to get a puzzle.

Puzzle #058: Get the Ball Out 1
-------------------------------
Location: Plaza
Examine: Door
-------------

Summary: Can you move all these various blocks in order to get 
the red ball to the bottom of the lock?

Solution: My strategy (which isn't the fastest) involves filling 
the right-hand side of the puzzle with blocks and not moving 
them at all. That way, you have less blocks you have to worry 
about dealing with.

1. Move the left blue block down.
2. Move the left green block down.
3. Move the right blue block up.
4. Move the upper purple block up and left.
5. Move the lower purple block up twice.
6. Move the bottom yellow block right.
7. Move the upper yellow block down.
8. Move the left blue block right.
9. Move the left green block down.
10. Move the upper yellow block in the upper/left corner.
11. Move the red ball down three times.
12. Move the upper yellow block right.
13. Move the left green block up.
14. Move the red ball into the lower/right corner.
15. Move the left blue block up.
16. Move the red ball into the finishing position.

---

If you go to the left, a loud noise sounds. Pauly says it comes 
from the mysterious tower.  Professor Layton figures that 
because people have been mentioning the tower a lot lately, it 
must be important.

Go inside the restaurant here and talk to Crouton for a puzzle.

Puzzle #024: Milk Pitchers
--------------------------
Location: Restaurant
Character: Crouton
------------------

Summary: Crouton has a ten-quart container of milk, a seven-
quart container and a three-quart container. Can you move the 
milk between the three containers until you get five quarts in 
two jars?

Solution: Move the milk like this:

1. Big to middle
2. Middle to small
3. Small to big
4. Middle to small
5. Small to big
6. Middle to small
7. Big to middle
8. Middle to small
9. Small to big

---

Leave the restaurant and go right to the plaza with the clock 
tower. Talk to Deke to gain access to the northern part of town, 
where the tower is. He doesn't let you pass until you've solved 
twelve puzzles, as well as puzzle #35.

Puzzle #035: Strange Dots
-------------------------
Location: Plaza
Character: Deke
---------------

Summary: You have some dice, with numbers associated. What is 
the number that goes with the fourth die?

Solution: Three! See, the dice are supposed to resemble clock 
hands. Deke must have thought up this puzzle because he's 
standing in front of a clock tower. 

---

Deke then steps aside and lets our heroes into the northern part 
of town. 

Video #11: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfUSRM6DWBM

You can get a number of puzzles here. One comes from Lucy, one 
comes from the cat and mouse, and one comes from the doorway to 
the left.

Puzzle #036: Too Many Mice
--------------------------
Location: Clock Tower
Character: Cat and Mouse
------------------------

Summary: A certain mouse species gives birth once a month, with 
twelve babies being born at a time. A mouse that is two months 
old can give birth.

You buy one of these mice. How many mice will you have in ten 
months?

Solution: One mouse, the one you bought.

---

Puzzle #037: Brother and Sister 
-------------------------------
Location: Clock Tower
Character: Lucy
---------------

Summary: A boy has an older sister. If you take two years away 
from the boy's age and give them to the sister, she would be 
twice his age. If you take three years away from the boy's age 
and give them to the sister, she would be three times his age. 
How old are they?

Solution: Math time! If B is the boy's age and G is the girl's 
age, the premises of the puzzle give us two equations.

2(B – 2) = G + 2
3(B – 3) = G + 3

The first equation simplifies into...

2B – 4 = G + 2
2B – 6 = G

The second equation simplifies into...

3B – 9 = G + 3
3B – 12 = G

Now we know that both 2B – 6 and 3B – 12 equal G, so...

2B – 6 = 3B – 12
2B + 6 = 3B
6 = B

The boy is 6. Now, plug that into 2B – 6 = G...

2(6) – 6 = G
12 – 6 = G
6 = G

The girl is 6 as well.

Alternately, you could have just guessed ages at random for one 
character and fit that age into both equations to see if it 
works.

Puzzle #107: A Worm's Dream
---------------------------
Location: Clock Tower
Examine: Doorway on the Left
----------------------------

Summary: We have a worm in an apple! Slide all the pieces of the 
puzzle into place.

Solution: The trick to the puzzle is that the upper/left and 
bottom/right pieces are identical. The bottom/right piece goes 
in the upper/left corner, and the upper/left piece goes in the 
bottom/right corner. So don't let the two identical pieces fool 
you while solving the puzzle.

---

Go north now. Both of the characters here have puzzles.

Puzzle #038: Island Hopping
---------------------------
Location: Fork in the Road
Character: Zappone
------------------

Summary: You have a series of islands and bridges. You want to 
visit every island once and cross over every bridge once. Sadly, 
this is impossible.

It IS possible if another bridge existed. Where should this 
bridge go?

Solution: The bridge goes from the purple house (in the middle 
of the diagram) to the lighthouse which is down/left of it.
 
---

Puzzle #039: One-Line Puzzle 2
------------------------------
Location: Fork in the Road
Character: Agnes
----------------

Summary: Agnes has four more pictures for you. Three of them can 
be drawn with one stroke of the pen, but one can't. Which one is 
the one that doesn't belong?

Solution: Professor Layton's top hat. Sorry, Professor!

----

Take the left fork to the north to reach the market, where there 
are two puzzles. One comes from Archibald, and one comes from 
the wall above Archibald.

Puzzle #040: How Old is Dad?
----------------------------
Location: Market
Character: Archibald
--------------------

Summary: A 22-year-old boy doesn't know how old his father is. 
The father figures his son is kind of a dolt, and tries to get 
him to think by saying he is as old as the son, plus half of his 
own age. How old is the father?

Solution: If you think about it, everyone is half of his or her 
own age, plus half of his or her own age. So the son's age must 
be half of the father's age. The son is 22, so the father must 
be 44.

---

Puzzle #101: Splitting It Up
----------------------------
Location: Market
Examine: Wall
-------------

Summary: You take a cube and paint all six sides red. Then, you 
cut the cube into 27 identical-sized pieces. How many of those 
pieces will have one red side?

Solution: Six, one on each face of the larger cube.

---
 
That's all there is to the left fork. Go back south, then take 
the right fork north.

Video #12: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r264v-kGf50 

A timid-looking fellow named Gerard is standing here. Talk to 
him twice for two puzzles. You might have to go away and come 
back to hear the second puzzle, though.

Puzzle #041: Spare Change
-------------------------
Location: Northern Path
Character: Gerard
-----------------

Summary: You have a picture of coins and a rope. If the rope is 
pulled tight, how many coins will be above it?

Solution: Nine.

---

Puzzle #042: The Camera and Case
--------------------------------
Location: Northern Path
Character: Gerard
-----------------

Summary: A person is selling a camera and a case for $310. He 
says the camera costs $300 more than the case.

You buy the case with a $100 bill. How much change should you 
get back?

Solution: We know that the camera and the case cost $310, and 
that the camera is $300 more than the case. The only way this 
works is if the camera is $305, and the case is $5.

So, if you pay $100 for a $5 case, you should get $95 in change.

---

Good news! This is the point in the game where you should have 
collected all the gizmo parts! Put them together to get a robot 
dog that hunts out hint coins!

When you go north from here, you meet Jarvis. He tells you that 
Zappone should know where Ramon is. Go south two screens, then 
talk to Zappone.

Zappone tells you to visit Crouton, the man who runs the 
restaurant. Go south two screens. Before visiting the restaurant 
to the left, you should go inside town hall building to get a 
puzzle from Rodney, and you should go north to get a puzzle from 
Lucy.

Puzzle #043: Three Umbrellas
----------------------------
Location: Clock Tower
Character: Lucy
---------------

Summary: There are three girls. Each person has an umbrella. But 
say they take their umbrellas from an umbrella stand without 
looking. What are the odds that only two girls will walk off 
with their own umbrellas?

Solution: The odds are 0. It's impossible for only two girls to 
have their own umbrellas. If two girls have their own umbrellas, 
the third girl has hers, too, which means _three_ girls have 
their own umbrellas.

Puzzle #044: Stamp Stumper
-------------------------
Location: Town Hall
Character: Rodney
-----------------

Summary: Divide the block of stamps into seven groups, each 
group with a total of 100. Just to make things harder, each 
group has to be a different shape.

Solution:

1122
11522
35557
34667
34477

---

With those puzzles out the way, it's high time to put an end to 
this chapter of the game. Go to the restaurant and talk to 
Crouton. He mentions a rumor about an old man who kidnaps 
people.

Crouton tells you to visit the cafe, and the chapter ends.

003d-Chapter Four: Night Falls
-----------------------------------------------------------

Video #13: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFM8oU-Urjs

It looks like the Professor and Luke get to do even MORE 
wandering around town.

Adrea here has a puzzle.

Puzzle #045: Puzzled Aliens
---------------------------
Location: Park Road
Character: Adrea
----------------

Summary: Some aliens are confused about an Earth device, and 
give a very strange description of it. What are they talking 
about?

Solution: The answer is a compass. Bleh...

---

When you go to the right, Gerard interrupts the investigation by 
forcing you to find his glasses. Fortunately, they're not far. 
Go left, then up to the park gate. Deke knows where the glasses 
are.

Puzzle #046: The Biggest Star
-----------------------------
Location: Park Gate
Character: Deke
---------------

Summary: Draw a line between four stars to make a big star.

Solution: The trick is that the top of the pine tree forms one 
of the points of the big star.
---

Deke tells you to go the inn for the glasses. So, go to the inn. 
Outside of the inn, click on the sign for a hidden puzzle.

Puzzle #113: The Pet Hotel
--------------------------
Location: Entrance
Examine: Inn Sign
-----------------

Summary: Rearrange the matches to spell the name of an animal.

Solution: CAT. Fortunately, not too many three-letter animal 
names exist, so guessing the correct answer is pretty easy.

---

Go inside the inn, and ask Beatrice for the glasses. She gives 
them to you. Then, go the Gerard and give him his glasses. He 
will now step aside and let you explore the north part of town. 
He will also give you a puzzle.

Puzzle #047: On the Run
-----------------------
Location: Plaza
Character: Gerard
-----------------

Summary: There's a map with many exits. A burglar starts at the 
red arrow, and whenever he reaches a junction, he turns left or 
right. He never retraces his steps, either. Which exit can he 
not go through?

Solution: Exit B! No matter which direction he approaches it 
from, he can't go through it.

--------------------------
Location: Clock Tower
Character: Cat and Mouse
------------------------

Summary: 5 cats catch 5 mice in 5 minutes. How many cats can 
catch 100 mice in 100 minutes?

Solution: 5 cats. Hey, if they catch mice at a rate of 5 mice 
per 5 minutes, that means in 100 minutes, they catch 100 mice.

---

Puzzle #049: 1,000 Times
------------------------
Location: Clock Tower
Character: Lucy
---------------

Summary: _ is 1,000 times _ _. Which letter fits in all three 
blanks?

Summary: There is a series of letters: O T T F _ S S E N T. 
Which letter goes in the empty spot?

Solution: The letters spell out the alphabet. One Two Three Four 
Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten. The answer is "F" for "Five".

---

Head inside the cafe. The barman agrees to help if you've solved 
30 puzzles. If you haven't done that yet, go to Granny 
Riddleton's shack and solve some puzzles.

Once you've solved enough puzzles, the Crumm the Barman tells 
you to see Prosciutto. To get to his house, you leave the cafe 
and take the right fork. However, Professor Layton is going to 
take the long way to Prosciutto's house, in order to make sure 
he finds all the puzzles in the north part of town.

Two puzzles are here at the cafe. Zappone has one, and the other 
is a hidden puzzle behind the bottles.
 
Puzzle #051: The Town Barbers
-----------------------------
Location: Crumm's Cafe
Character: Zappone
------------------

Summary: The two has two barbers. Barber A has a horrible 
haircut, and Barber B has a nice haircut. Who is the better 
barber?

Solution: Barber A. The assumption is that the barbers cut each 
other's hair, instead of cutting their own hair. If that's the 
case, Barber A gives a better haircut.

---

Puzzle #106: How Many Glasses?
------------------------------
Location: Crumm's Cafe
Examine: Bottles
----------------

Summary: A man wants to move the glasses of juice in the top row 
so they look like the glasses of juice in the bottom row. What 
is the least number of glasses he has to touch?

Solution: One. Presumably, he pour from one glass into another 
without touching the second glass.

---

Summary: Oh no! A monster is attacking the town! Stab it in the 
eye!

Solution: The monster is the sky, so stab the moon.

---

Head to the right to see Pauly, who's upset. He always seems 
upset about something, I've noticed.
 
Video #15: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0dFELmUeg8

Pauly's upset because he can't solve a puzzle! This looks like a 
job for Professor Layton!

Puzzle #052: Find a Star
------------------------
Location: Northern Hill
Character: Pauly
----------------

Summary: Find a star in the picture.

Solution: It's in the upper-left corner.

---

Pauly gets mad at the Professor for solving the puzzle. That's 
gratitude for you!

Go south and into a house to the left. This is Prosciutto's 
house. He's got a big ham hanging from his ceiling, and those of 
you who speak Italian will be amused at the fact that 
"Prosciutto" means "ham" in Italian.
 
Talk to him, and he tells you about the strange kidnapper. Then, 
tap on the ham for a hidden puzzle.

Puzzle #114: Tetrahedron Trial
------------------------------
Location: Prosciutto's
Examine: Ham
------------

Summary: You are given a picture of a tetrahedron that has been 
lain flat. Which of the triangles goes in the empty spot so all 
the various lines will connect with the tetrahedron is folded up 
again?

Solution: C

---

Leave Prosciutto's house. Professor Layton and Luke seem to have 
reached the end of the investigation for the day...when they see 
a stranger stuffing an unconscious Ramon inside a large sack.

Our heroes give chase, but the stranger manages to flee and hide 
inside the tower. The tower's lights go on, and a large noise 
sounds.

Our heroes return to the scene of the kidnapping, where they 
find a small cog, just like the one found at the scene of the 
murder. How odd. In any case, chapter four is now over!

003e-Chapter Five: The Hunt Begins
-----------------------------------------------------------

Professor Layton returns to Reinhold Manor to tell everyone the 
bad news about Ramon being kidnapped and/or possibly murdered. 
Inspector Chelmey seems disinclined to agree about the matter, 
and it seems he is right, as Ramon comes walking in through the 
door shortly after!

Ramon denies any knowledge of being kidnapped. Luke wants to 
argue, but the Professor shushes him.

Chelmey, Ramon and Lady Dahlia leave. Talk to Gordon for a 
puzzle.

Puzzle #012: Make a Rectangle
-----------------------------
Location: Manor Parlor
Character: Gordon
-----------------

Summary: You have a shape that can be cut into two pieces. The 
two pieces can be put together to form a rectangle.

Solution: The top piece should be shaped like this. 

  _ _ _ _ _
 |_|_|_|_|_|
     |_|

---

When you leave the manor, Professor Layton and Luke talk. Layton 
agrees that they saw a dead or unconscious Ramon and does not 
understand what happened. Why, the things that are happening 
here are downright curious!

Video #16: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK9lB_bkV1o

A new day begins, and it starts with a phone call from Inspector 
Chelmey, who wants to see Professor Layton and Luke at the 
manor. The Professor hopes the discussion will be about what 
happened yesterday.

Talk to Beatrice here for a puzzle.

Puzzle #055: The Odd Sandwich
-----------------------------
Location: Inn
Character: Beatrice
-------------------

Summary: Beatrice has an odd sandwich that she wants to fit 
inside her small lunchbox. How many times does she need to cut 
the sandwich before it fits?

Solution: Once.

---

Leave the Inn and talk to Stachenscarfen for a puzzle.

Puzzle #056: The Lazy Guard
---------------------------
Location: Entrance
Character: Stachenscarfen
-------------------------

Summary: A lazy guard wants to walk through nine rooms while 
making the fewest number of turns possible. How many turns will 
he make?

Solution: The trick is that he can make fewer turns if he enters 
the room at an angle than if he enters the room while going 
perpendicular to the doorway. The answer is two.

---

Go north, and talk to Deke for a puzzle.

Puzzle #057: Cut Which One?
---------------------------
Location: Plaza
Character: Deke
---------------

Summary: There are six interlocked rings in the picture. Which 
one can you cut away to make an unbroken chain of five rings?

Solution: Cut off Ring D.

---

Head right. There's a piece of paper on the ground here that 
talks about the death of Lady Violet, Baron Reinhold's first 
wife. You'll learn more about her backstory soon.

Talk to Marco here for a puzzle.

Puzzle #059: The Longest Path
-----------------------------
Location: Manor Road
Character: Marco
----------------

Summary: Can you get from point A to point B while taking the 
longest route?

Solution: You want to go left from A. Take the second left three 
times in a row. Then, take the first left, the first right, the 
second right twice, and then reach B.

---

Head to the manor now. Claudia is outside it, and tapping on her 
reveals a puzzle.

Puzzle #060: Weighing Cats
--------------------------
Location: Reinhold Manor
Character: Claudia
------------------

Summary: You have two equations here.

Four white cats = 5 black cats
1 white cat + 2 black cats = 3 red cats

What about 3 red cats + 4 black cats VS 4 white cats and 1 black 
cat? Which of those two groups is heavier? Or do they weigh the 
same?

Solution: The first group is heavier, which is easier to see if 
you replace "3 red cats" with "1 white cat + 2 black cats". So, 
the correct answer is "A".

---

Video #17: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=807YHchfvik

Head inside the manor now to see Chelmey yell at Matthew for 
bringing him sweets. The Inspector certainly has a temper, and 
he turns it on Professor Layton. He's mad that Layton interfered 
with the murder case yesterday, trying to raise up a panic about 
Ramon being killed when Ramon is perfectly fine. He orders 
Layton off the case.

That's quite rude of Inspector Chelmey, but Layton doesn't want 
to give up quite yet. Leave the manor and go south to talk to 
Ramon. He confirms the story he said yesterday; he says nothing 
happened at all. Apparently, he doesn't remember being 
kidnapped.

Professor Layton then decides that he and Luke don't HAVE to 
solve the murder mystery. They came to St. Mystere to solve the 
mystery of the Golden Apple, and by golly, that's what they're 
going to do. Thus begins Chapter Five.

That's right. About three hours into the game, Professor Layton 
and Luke decide to try solving the mystery that they came to the 
curious village to solve. Good job, Professor!

The Professor decides to start his search in the manor. Go 
inside the manor and upstairs to talk to the people there. All 
three have puzzles, and Gordon has two.

Puzzle #061: Pin Board Shapes
-----------------------------
Location: Manor Parlor
Character: Gordon
-----------------

Summary: What is the largest cross you can make a pin board that 
has 17 pins inside it, and 16 pins outside it?

Solution: The cross needs to be tilted at a 45 degree angle. 
It'll look something like this, if you draw a line between the 
various x's:

..x.x..
.x.x.x.
x.....x
.x...x.
x.....x
.x.x.x.
..x.x..

Puzzle #103: Wood Cutouts
-------------------------
Location: Manor Parlor
Character: Gordon
-----------------

Summary: You have an oddly-shaped piece of plywood that you want 
to cut into four identical pieces.

Solution: Each piece will be shaped like this:

x    x
xxxxxx  (that's six blocks wide)

Puzzle #062: The Mysterious Note
--------------------------------
Location: Manor Parlor
Character: Inspector Chelmey
----------------------------

Summary: Chelmey once got a note that reads like this:

710 57735 34
5509 51 7719

Which suspect, Bill, John or Todd, is the one whom Chelmey 
should arrest, based on that note?

Solution: When you flip your DS upside down, you can see that 
the numbers spell out "Bill is boss. He sells oil." Bill is the 
one who should be arrested. 

Puzzle #063: How Old is Mom?
----------------------------
Location: Manor Parlor
Character: Lady Dahlia
----------------------

Summary: A father says he was once twice as old as his wife. The 
next year, he was only one and a half times her age. If the 
father is 44 years old now, how old is the mother?

Solution: When you work out the math, it ends up being the case 
that the father is tricky, and talking about when he was two 
years old. The mother was one year old at the time. The next 
year, when she was two, he was three (which is one and a half 
times two).

The father is therefore one year older than the mother. If he's 
44, she's 43. Answer? 43.

---

Once those puzzles are done, go downstairs and talk to Matthew. 
He can't tell you much about the late Baron Reinhold, but he 
recommends that you see Ingrid, who worked at the manor with the 
Baron for a longer period of time than Matthew did.

Video #18: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRtmwBgIAgY

Head south/down a couple of screens to the area with Marco. Hey, 
Ingrid is there! What a fortunate coincidence.

Ingrid tells you more about Lady Violet, the Baron's first wife. 
Go north twice and tap on Matthew to visit Lady Violet's grave. 
Matthew also tells the Professor about the Baron's journal.

Head to Lady Dahlia's room on the top floor. The journal is on 
the desk to the left. Read it to learn that the Baron left a 
clue about the Golden Apple with one of his friends.

So now our mission is to find the Baron's friend! Leave the 
manor to find Ingrid. Talk to her, and she tells you that 
Zappone was a friend of the Baron.

Zappone is hanging around the fork in the road, so head there 
now. But first, you want to take a brief detour in Town Hall to 
talk to Rodney.

Puzzle #064: Odd Equations
--------------------------
Location: Town Hall
Character: Rodney
-----------------

Summary: If 8 – 6 = 2, and 8 + 6 = 2, what does 7 + 6 equal?

Solution: This puzzle uses time (or any other base 12 unit of 
measurement) for an answer. 8 o'clock + 6 hours = 2 o'clock, and 
8 o'clock - 6 hours = 2 o'clock. Six hours past seven is one 
o'clock, so the answer is "one".

---

Leave City Hall and go to the north part of town. Before heading 
to the fork in the road, you can talk to Lucy and look at the 
cat and mouse for puzzles.

Puzzle #066: Birthday Girl
--------------------------
Location: Clock Tower
Character: Lucy
---------------

Summary: A woman, talking about her birthday, says she turns 22 
in two days, and on New Year's last year, she was 19. When is 
her birthday?

Solution: January second. Today, in terms of the puzzle, must be 
New Year's Eve. Tricky!

Puzzle #067: The Chocolate Code
-------------------------------
Location: Clock Tower
Character: Lucy
---------------

Summary: Your gadget-loving girlfriend has sent you a message in 
some chocolate. It says GRCY NW. What does that mean in English?

Solution: "TEXT ME". See, the bites of the chocolate refer to 
directions on a keyboard...yeah, I know, it's a pretty iffy 
puzzle. That's probably why it's not in the European version of 
the game.

---

Video #19: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ1lfNYBRo0

Puzzle #065: What's E?
----------------------
Location: Clock Tower
Character: Cat and Mouse
------------------------

Summary: According to the diagram, A = 2, C = 3, B = 3, D = 4. 
What does E equal?

Solution: Well, it's kind of hard to show you with a picture of 
the diagram, but the number refers to the number of sides that 
the labeled section shares with another piece of the puzzle. E 
must equal 5.

---

That's all for now, so head north to meet Zappone. Ask him about 
the Baron, and he denies being a _good_ friend of the Baron. 
Sigh...another dead end. I guess that means the Professor and 
Luke will just have to ask everyone they meet about the Baron in 
hopes of finding his friend.

Go up the right path. Another journal entry is lying on the 
ground here. It doesn't seem like the Baron's journal, either. 
The journal entries seem mysterious...unless, of course, you 
already know about the ending of the game, in which case, the 
mysterious journal entries aren't really mysteries at all.

Talk to Gerard here twice for a puzzle.

Puzzle #068: Find the Pentagons
------------------------------- 
Location: Northern Path
Character: Gerard
-----------------

Summary: Can you find all the pentagons in this picture? How 
many are there?

Solution: There are twelve pentagons.

---

Head inside Prosciutto's for a puzzle.

Puzzle #069: Chocolate Puzzle
-----------------------------
Location: Prosciutto's
Character: Prosciutto
---------------------

Summary: You want to break a bar of chocolate into 30 pieces. 
How many times must you break the bar?

Solution: 29 times. The last time, you're splitting a piece in 
half. The puzzle tries to distract you by giving you a lot of 
unnecessary instructions, but don't be fooled!

---

Head to the marketplace, where there's a brief cutscene with 
Giuseppe. He was told that Layton bought a vase. Layton touches 
the vase, getting his fingerprints all over it.

Meanwhile, the mysterious villain who crash-landed in town a few 
chapters ago watches from the shadows.

Layton returns the vase. The villain in the shadows later takes 
the vase and tries to use it for a nefarious purpose, but that 
happens later on. For now, Giuseppe apologizes for the confusion 
by giving the Professor a puzzle.

Puzzle #070: The Shattered Vase
-------------------------------
Location: Market
Character: Giuseppe
-------------------

Summary: Put the pieces of the vase back together.

Solution: Well, this certainly is an easy jigsaw puzzle. Put the 
pieces back into place, then give yourself a pat on the back.

---

There's a big newspaper here. Tap on it to read an article about 
Inspector Chelmey. Ah, how sweet! He's devoted to his wife, and 
hey, wait a minute. Is he eating sweets? But...he doesn't like 
sweets! He yelled at Matthew about them earlier on in this 
chapter!

Video #20: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iACvEBrjV4E

Reading the newspaper article about Chelmey causes Archibald to 
appear. Guess what? Archibald is the Baron's friend that we're 
looking for! How fortunate.

But first, talk to Giuseppe for a puzzle.

Puzzle #071: Sausage Thief
--------------------------
Location: Market
Character: Giuseppe
-------------------

Summary: Someone ate the butcher's sausages! Four boys make 
statements about the crime.

A: B ate them.
B: D ate them.
C: I didn't eat them.
D: B is lying.

One of these boys is telling the truth. So, who at the sausage?

Solution: Boy C ate the sausages. Also, boy D is the one who is 
telling the truth.

Great, so NOW talk to Archibald about Baron Reinhold. Archibald 
says he has a desk the Baron gave him. Perhaps a note is inside? 
The Professor and Luke go to Archibald's home to see.

Examine the desk. A note is in the right-hand drawer...but all 
it contains is an X. Perhaps it's a map of some kind...but a map 
to where?

Thus ends chapter five.

003f-Chapter Six: The Elusive Tower
-----------------------------------------------------------

Archibald interrupts, saying that Beatrice at the Inn wants to 
speak to the Professor. Well, a gentleman never wants to keep a 
lady waiting, so it's off to the inn.

But first, a hidden puzzle.

Puzzle #108: Not Knots?
-----------------------
Location: Archibald's
Examine: Bookshelf
------------------

Summary: There are four pieces of string onscreen. Which ones 
will form a knot when you grab their ends and pull them tight?

Solution: Rope C is the only one that forms a knot.

---

Off to the inn! Once you go inside and talk to Beatrice, she 
talks about a mysterious stranger who trashed his room and 
skipped without paying his bill. The picture of the stranger 
resembles the mysterious villain we've seen a few times.

Beatrice asks the Professor to find this man.

Leave the inn, and Luke notes that there's been a general lack 
of progress in the game so far. The Professor disagrees and 
notes that many people in town have warned against going to the 
tower on the north part of town, the tower that makes mysterious 
noises (also the tower the kidnapped disappeared into when he 
took Ramon).

Perhaps the Golden Apple is in the tower, and nobody knows 
anything about it because everyone avoids the tower. It's 
certainly a possibility.

Chapter Six officially starts here. It's a rather short chapter. 
All you have to do is go north as far as you can, and the 
chapter ends.

Go north once, to the plaza. There are two puzzles here. Percy 
has one, and Rodney (inside the Town Hall) has the other.

Puzzle #072: The Sound of Silence
---------------------------------
Location: Plaza
Character: Percy
----------------

Summary: Which of the following words does not make the sound of 
silence?

Note
Rhythm
Scale
Rest
Treble
Chord
Scale

Solution: Well..."note" and "scale" contain silent e's, and 
"chord" has a silent "h". The "sound of silence", therefore, 
refers to silent letters. The answer is "rest", which is the 
only word on the list without a silent letter.

Puzzle #073: How Many Squares?
------------------------------
Location: Town Hall
Character: Rodney
-----------------

Summary: Rodney gives you a pin board with twelve dots. How many 
squares can you form on this pin board?

Solution: The answer is eleven.

---

Video #21: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9dRH4HsNkI

Head north a couple of times, to the marketplace. Agnes has two 
puzzles for you.

Puzzle #074: A Broken Window
----------------------------
Location: Market
Character: Agnes
----------------

Summary: Four children were playing ball, and one of them broke 
a window. All four children make a statement.

A: I didn't break the window.
B: I broke the window.
C: A did not break the window.
D: B did not break the window.

The child who broke the window is lying; the other children may 
or may not be lying. Who broke the window?

Solution: Use logical deduction to solve this puzzle. For 
example, you can immediately deduce that B did not break the 
window. If B did break the window, B would lie about it, not 
admit to it.

It turns out that Child A broke the window, and B and C lied.

Puzzle #075: The Wire Cube
--------------------------
Location: Market
Character: Agnes
----------------

Summary: You want to create a cube out of wires, using the 
fewest number of wires possible. No portion of the cube can have 
more than one length of wire running over the same edge.

Solution: I do not understand this puzzle, but the answer is 
four, because a cube has eight corners (?) and each wire has two 
ends, and eight divided by two is four.

---

You can now head north of the market for the first time ever to 
reach the path entrance. The sign here contains a hidden puzzle.

Puzzle #119: Red and Blue 1
---------------------------
Location: Path Entrance
Examine: Sign
-------------

Summary: Switch the red balls with the blue balls.

Solution: The strategy I use is to first switch the balls on the 
bottom row. That makes it possible for you to empty out either 
the left or right side and move the ball on the bottom row to 
the top row. You can then do the same thing on the other side, 
so the balls on the top row are in place, and you don't have to 
move them again.

From there, it's simple enough to fill in the balls in the 
second-to-top row. Then switch the bottom row balls and put the 
remaining balls in place. As you can kind of guess, I found it 
was easiest to concentrate on filling up one row at a time.

So once again, my strategy is to:

1) Swap the two balls on the bottom row.
2) Get balls into place on the top row.
3) Fill the second-from-the-top row.
4) Fill the bottom row again.
5) Fill the remaining row. 

---

North of here is the Tower Road, where you can find another 
journal entry. You can also find two puzzles here.

Puzzle #102: Aces and the Joker
-------------------------------
Location: Tower Road
Character: Martha
-----------------

Summary: You have a deck of 52 cards scattered all around, and 
you pick them up one-by-one. What are the odds that you'll pick 
up the four aces before the joker?

Solution: This puzzle is easier than it seems. You don't have to 
worry about all 52 cards; you only need to worry about five 
cards: the aces and joker. The odds of picking the joker last 
out of the group is one in five, because there is one joker and 
five cards. 1 in 5 is 20%, so the answer is 20.

Puzzle #117: Painting a Cube
----------------------------
Location: Tower Road
Examine: Window
---------------

Summary: You want to paint a cube so that all the faces of the 
cube that touch each other are different colors. You have three 
colors, so how many ways can you paint the cube?
 
Solution: Just one. Any variations are simply the same cube 
rotated.

---

When you go north, you reach the base of the tower, which is 
shut off. There is a cutscene starring a mysterious woman at 
this point in the game. She runs off and leaves a ticket for the 
local amusement park behind her. Is this some sort of clue?

003g-Chapter Seven: The Abandoned Park
-----------------------------------------------------------

Video #22: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5fV607q51g

Professor Layton decides to follow up the clue about the 
amusement park by going to the amusement park.

On your way to the park (which is on the left-hand side of 
town), you go to the park road, where Pauly and Adrea have 
puzzles.

Puzzle #076: A Tile Square
--------------------------
Location: Park Road
Character: Pauly
----------------

Summary: You have a tile that is 10 inches by 12 inches by .5 
inches long. What is the fewest number of tiles you would need 
to make a perfect square out of one of those sides?

Solution: 20 tiles, as 20 X .5 = 10. So all the .5 tiles would 
line up to form a square with the 10 inch side.

Puzzle #077: Which Job?
-----------------------
Location: Park Road
Character: Adrea
-----------------

Summary: Company A pays 100,000 a year and gives you a 20,000 
raise yearly. Company B pays 50,000 every six months, with a 
5,000 raise each six months. Which company should you work for?

Solution: Company B. Because it gives more frequent raises, the 
salary for that company increases more quickly. When you add up 
the total amount of money you made in one year, Company B always 
ends up having given you more. 

---

Now, head inside the restaurant for a series of puzzles.

Puzzle #078: Water Pitchers
---------------------------
Location: Restaurant
Character: Crouton
------------------

Summary: Crouton has a 16 quart jar, a 9 quart jar and a 7 quart 
jar. 

Solution: Crouton has a few puzzles that involve separating 
liquids in uneven containers. The solution to these puzzles is 
generally these four steps:

1. Big jar to middle jar
2. Middle jar to small jar
3. Small jar to big jar
4. Middle jar to small jar

Just repeat the four steps until you get the desired amount of 
liquid. In this case, it takes fifteen turns.


Puzzle #079: Apples to Oranges
------------------------------
Location: Restaurant
Character: Crouton
------------------

Summary: Can you switch the apple crates with orange crates?

Solution: Why, this is quite similar to the red and blue puzzle 
a while ago, except easier. The way I solve it is by switching 
the two upper corners, then switching the other two boxes in the 
top row. That way, the two top rows are switched and you no 
longer have to worry about them.

Then, do the exact same thing with the bottom rows, and slip the 
middle rows into place. It's not too difficult.

---

You can leave the restaurant now or later to learn that the gate 
to the park is locked, which officially starts Chapter Seven, by 
the way.

Video #23: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZfkbcHUy0E

---

Okay, enough chess puzzles. Time to continue with the plot. If 
you haven't already, check the gate to the park to learn that 
it's locked. Then, stop by Town Hall and ask Rodney what's going 
on.

Rodney doesn't know where the caretaker to the park is, but he 
mentions the man doubles as the caretaker for the sewers. So, 
head back to the park road and go down into the sewers.

When you're in the sewers, you can tap on the manhole for a 
puzzle.

Puzzle #120: Get the Ball Out! 3
--------------------------------
Location: Sewer Exit
Examine: Manhole
----------------

Summary: Can you move the ball to the bottom of the screen?

Solution: The strategy is to move the yellow block right, which 
will require moving the green block to the bottom/right. You can 
free up some space by working in a counter-clockwise fashion.

1. Move the bottom blue block right.
2. Move the bottom purple block into the exit.
3. Move the bottom blue block left twice.
4. Move the second-from-bottom blue block down to the bottom 
row.
5. Move the right green block down.
6. Move the upper purple block right twice.
7. Move the upper blue block right twice.

The caretaker you're looking for is on the right, but people are 
hanging around in the sewers, waiting to give puzzles to you. 
You don't want to disappoint these puzzle fans, do you?

Go left and talk to Stachenscarfen for a puzzle.

Puzzle #084: Which Boxes to Move?
---------------------------------
Location: Sewer Exit
Character: Stachenscarfen
-------------------------

Summary: You are given a picture of 20 boxes. Several of them 
(namely, the ones on the outside) can be written on. How many 
boxes cannot be written on without moving some of the boxes on 
the outside of the structure?

Solution: Three.

---

You can go down the left tunnel to reach the outside of St. 
Mystere. From this vantage point, you can see the Laytonmobile, 
which reminds the Professor of a puzzle.

Puzzle #085: Weekend Getaway
----------------------------
Location: Outside the Sewer
Examine: Laytonmobile
---------------------

Summary: You and your girlfriend drove somewhere. You drove 180 
miles there (she drove the rest of the way), and she drove 150 
miles back (you drove the rest of the way).

You drove more miles than your girlfriend, but HOW many more 
miles did you drive?

Solution: You drove 60 more miles than her (60 = (180-150) * 2).

---

Head back inside the sewer. This time, take the right route in 
order to find Sylvain, the park caretaker. Naturally, he'll help 
you out only if you solve his puzzle.

Puzzle #086: Squares and Circles
--------------------------------
Location: Sewer Dead End
Character: Sylvain
------------------

Summary: You have a picture here. What is the area of the red 
square compared to the area of the blue square? That is, the 
blue square is how many times larger than the red square?

Solution: You can use math, you can try the game's recommended 
solution of redrawing the middle square so it's easier to 
conceptualize, or you can just look at the picture and say, 
"Hey! That big square is four times as big as the smaller 
square!" Either way, the answer is four.

---

Sylvain will now open the park, so Professor Layton and Luke 
leave the sewer and enter the park. It's abandoned, and if you 
check the posters, it seems that Baron Reinhold had this park 
made specifically for the amusement of his daughter Flora.

You'll want to explore the entire park. Go north once to reach 
the big tent. A puzzle is here on the side of the concessions 
booth.

Puzzle #115: Odd Box Out
------------------------
Location: Abandoned Tent
Examine: Side of Booth
----------------------

Summary: You have pictures of four blocks. Actually, wait! There 
are only two boxes! Three pictures are of the same box, just 
rotated. The other picture is of a completely different box 
(okay, not ALL that different). Which box is the different box?

Solution: D. Boxes A, B and C are all the same box.

---
Video #25: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn2ECly1PTU

Okay, time to explore the amusement park thoroughly, and then 
watch Professor Layton and Luke get attacked by a killer ferris 
wheel.

Go to the right and examine this ferris wheel. It looks normal 
enough. Look at it twice, and you'll get a puzzle!

Puzzle #087: Ferris Wheel Riddle
--------------------------------
Location: Ferris Wheel
Examine: Ferris Wheel 
---------------------

Summary: The ferris wheel has 10 2-seat cars. It turns at a 
speed of 1 full rotation every 10 minutes (in other words, 1 car 
goes through the gates every minute).

The ferris wheel started moving at 10:00 and stopped at 10:30. 
How many people could have taken a ride on the ferris wheel in 
this time?

Solution: 42. That's 30 minutes, minutes the last nine minutes 
(as nobody who boarded the ferris wheel at that time could have 
made a full rotation), which is 21 cars. There are 2 people per 
car, and 21 * 2 = 42, so the answer is 42 people.

---

Head to the right to see a shack that is locked. It seems to 
lead to the sewers. That's somewhat strange.

Go south. Sylvain is here. You can also pick up a piece of paper 
here to read a journal entry about Flora, the town's secret and 
the park. There are two puzzles here.

Puzzle #088: In a Hole
----------------------
Location: Shack Path
Character: Sylvain
------------------

Summary: Oh no! Your tennis ball has fallen down a hole! Name a 
five-letter tool you can use to get it out safely.

Solution: The answer is "water". Ha, I remember this puzzle from 
a Martin Gardner book!

Puzzle #116: The Largest Total
------------------------------
Location: Shack Path
Examine: Shack (particularly, the sack) 
---------------------------------------

Summary: You want to make a magic square using odd numbers 
between 1 and 51. You want the highest possible number as the 
magic number, so what is the number in the middle? 

Solution: The number in the middle is 51, the largest number you 
can use. You don't even have to worry about any of the other 
squares or what the magic number IS to solve the puzzle!

--

By this time, you should have been to all the parts of the park. 
Return to the ferris wheel once the park is thoroughly explored 
for an exciting cutscene where the mysterious villain attempts 
to kill Professor Layton by means of a ferris wheel.

Fortunately for our heroes, they dodge the ferris wheel. The 
ferris wheel destroys the locked shed instead. That means our 
heroes can go to the other sewer system in the town! Um...yay?

Oh, wait. The professor thinks it's an underground passage that 
leads to the tower, not a sewer system. That must be his famous 
intuition talking again! Head into the underground passage.

Video #26: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27MksQdc-t8

There's a puzzle on the wall here. It points to the exit to this 
room.

Puzzle #089: Which Way
----------------------
Location: Under the Shack
Examine: Sign
-------------

Summary: Can you find the hidden arrow in this picture?

Solution: The arrow is bigger than the one shown, and it is 
pointing left. The rightmost end of the arrow is against the 
right edge of the picture. It is on the middle/lower part of the 
picture.

---

The Professor realizes that he must go left. Do so, and you come 
across a locked door.

Puzzle #090: Get the Ball Out! 2
--------------------------------
Location: Underground Path
Examine: Locked Door
--------------------

Summary: Can you get the ball out of the maze?

Solution: My strategy is just to move things around in a 
clockwise manner in order to free up space; once that's done, I 
move the red ball to the exit. The puzzle can be solved in fewer 
moves than I take, though.

1. Move the bottom blue block right.
2. Move the bottom purple block into the exit.
3. Move the bottom blue block left twice.
4. Move the right purple block down and right.
5. Move the right green block down twice.
6. Move the upper purple block right twice.
7. Move the upper blue block right twice.
8. Move the left purple block up and left.
9. Move the left green block up twice.
10. Move the left blue block left twice.
11. Move the yellow block down once.
12. Move the red ball down twice and right twice.
13. Move the left green block down once.
14. Move the left purple block right twice and up once.
15. Move the upper blue block left three times.
16. Move the yellow block up twice.
17. Move the right green block left twice.
18. Move the lowest purple block up twice.
19. Move the red ball to the exit.


---

Solving the puzzle opens the door and leads to a curious room. 
Examine the paintings on the back wall to find a hidden corner 
that contains the key to the tower. But...where is the keyhole? 
Perhaps the dead end in front of the tower isn't as dead as it 
appears.
 
Chapter Seven ends, and the key is added to the list of 
mysteries.

003h-Chapter Eight: The Shadowy Intruder
-----------------------------------------------------------

Examine the paintings on the right wall for a puzzle.

Puzzle #091: Pattern Matching
-----------------------------
Location: Underground Area
Examine: Paintings
------------------

Summary: Which of the four given stitches fit the pattern?

Solution: B.

---

Return to the village now. When you leave the park, Professor 
Layton will decide NOT to investigate the dead end until 
determining the identity of whoever it is who tried to kill them 
with a ferris wheel. Thus, Chapter Eight officially begins.

Professor Layton thinks the key to figuring out who the villain 
is lies at the inn--after all, the villain must be the person 
who skipped out without paying his bill, right? Not paying bills 
and attempting to kill archaeologists with remote-control ferris 
wheels are both villainous deeds, after all.

Before heading to the inn, go into the sewers. On the right path 
is Sylvain with a puzzle.

Puzzle #092: Wash Up
--------------------
Location: Sewer Dead End
Character: Sylvain
------------------

Summary: You want to turn as few valves as possible to get water 
flowing in these pipes. Which valves do you open?

Solution: You should open the only valve on the second-from-the-
top level, and the leftmost valve on the second-from-the-bottom 
level.

---

Now return to the inn and talk to Beatrice. The Professor will 
ask for some newspapers, for reasons that don't get explained. 
All the newspapers have gone missing, for other reasons that 
don't get explained.

Ramon shows up and says that Chelmey wishes to see him. Off to 
Reinhold Manor!

Video #27: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZqupjJn9p0

On the way to the manor, Professor Layton meets up with the 
mysterious woman he met in front of the wall on the north part 
of town. She knows that he has the key to the tower, and she 
warns him to stay away. Then she leaves.

Go north to Ramon. Talk to him for a puzzle. 

Puzzle #093: Over the River
---------------------------
Location: Manor Border
Character: Ramon
----------------

Summary: Help Stachenscarfen get his wolf, sheep and cabbage 
across the river. He can only take one item at a time, and he 
can't leave the wolf alone with the sheep, nor the sheep alone 
with the cabbage.

Solution: This takes seven moves.

1. Take the sheep to the right.
2. Go left.
3. Take the cabbage right.
4. Take the sheep left.
5. Take the wolf right.
6. Go left.
7. Take the sheep right.

---

Time for a healthy dose of plot. Go to the upstairs portion of 
the manor to meet Chelmey.

Inspector Chelmey believes that Layton is the person who 
murdered Simon. His evidence? Layton's fingerprints were found 
on a vase...the vase which was the murder weapon!

That's the vase that was handed to Professor Layton in the 
marketplace in chapter five. Remember? Puzzle #70 was about the 
vase.

Inspector Chelmey destroys the vase and starts hurling 
accusations. Professor Layton brushes them aside by offering a 
few alternate theories as to what happened.

A cutscene occurs where Layton comes to the conclusion that 
Inspector Chelmey is the criminal. He then asks what the 
Inspector's favorite food is, according to the newspaper article 
about him.

Inspector Chelmey likes potato fritters. After all, there's a 
picture of him eating the fritters his wife Amelie made.

Chelmey says that he only likes Amelie's fritters. Professor 
Layton points to the newspaper article that clearly states that 
Chelmey's wife is named Amy, not Amelie.

Aha! Layton laid a clever trap to catch this fiend!

Layton further points out that the gate to town was shut during 
their search for Claudia, yet Chelmey claims to have entered 
town much later, after Simon was murdered. He couldn't have 
entered town when he claimed, as the gate to town was already 
shut!

Furthermore, Layton questions the fact that Chelmey knows about 
the key to the tower, when no one told him about it, and 
Professor Layton has told no one about it either.

Now for the big revelation...Chelmey is really Don Paolo in 
disguise! That's exciting...but who's Don Paolo?

It turns out that Don Paolo is an evil genius who randomly 
decided that Professor Layton is his archnemesis. How utterly 
bizarre, given the fact that Professor Layton has never met him 
before. 

Don Paolo swears revenge and escapes through the window.

003i-Chapter Nine: The Tower's Secret
-----------------------------------------------------------

Video #28: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVuIgmPR6Ps

Well, now that Don Paolo is out of the way, it must be time to 
head to the tower and find the Golden Apple. Stop by Archibald's 
house on the way there, though (Lucy is standing right outside 
Archibald's house); he has a puzzle.

Puzzle #109: Laziest Man on Earth
---------------------------------
Location: Archibald's
Character: Archibald
--------------------

Summary: A lazy man is sitting in his chair in his living room. 
Which part of the room can he not reach without getting up?

Solution: Underneath the chair! 

---

If you head to Prosciutto's, you get a puzzle.

Puzzle #104: A Sweet Treat
--------------------------
Location: Prosciutto's
Character: Prosciutto
---------------------

Summary: Your friends enjoy giving you unnecessary 
complications. They have a four by four piece of chocolate, and 
they want you to divide it into four equal shapes, each with an 
almond in a different position.

Solution: Divide the pieces like this...

aacc
abcd
abcd
bbdd

---

Okay, enough diversions. Time to head straight to the tower. Oh, 
wait. On the way, you meet Martha. Talk to her for a puzzle.

Puzzle #105: Rolling a Three
----------------------------
Location: Tower Road
Character: Martha
-----------------

Summary: The odds of rolling a three on one roll of a die is 
1/6. The odds of doing it twice in a row are 1/36. The odds of 
doing it three times in a row are 1/216.

Well, you've just rolled three threes in a row. What are the 
odds of rolling a three on your next roll?

Solution: As the summary says, the odds of rolling a three on 
one roll of a die is 1/6. The question is designed trick you 
into thinking that you're supposed to give the odds of rolling 
four threes in a row.

---

Okay, NOW head to the tower. You run into the dead end, but 
Professor Layton notices a keyhole he didn't see before. The 
tower key perfectly fits into the keyhole, and the keyhole 
matches up with the X on the piece of paper found in the Baron's 
desk in Archibald's house.

Chapter Nine officially starts here.

Head to the door and tap on it. It doesn't open unless you have 
solved 75 out of the 113 puzzles you could have solved by now. 
If you haven't solved enough puzzles, go to Granny Riddleton to 
solve puzzles you missed and start talking to everyone in hopes 
that they give you puzzles to solve. 

When you can go inside, Professor Layton and Luke will crash 
through the floor and end up in an odd laboratory. Whoever runs 
the laboratory is apparently keeping tabs on everyone in town. 
What an odd place.

Video #30: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeVUPuvGJ04 

When you try to head upstairs, our heroes meet Bruno. Bruno will 
give you a long, ridiculous backstory. Pretty much everyone in 
the village is a robot, but no one has ever noticed. The tower 
is Bruno's workshop, and when he "kidnaps" someone, he's just 
performing repairs on them.

...Wow.

Now the Professor's mission is the scale the tower. Each floor 
of the tower has a puzzle. Solve a puzzle to get to the next 
level. At the top is the Golden Apple...whatever it may be.

Along the way, the Professor and Luke will wrap up various loose 
ends of the plot of the game.

Puzzle #094: Get The Ball Out 4!
--------------------------------
Location: Tower Floor 1
Examine: Locked door
--------------------

Summary: Get the ball to the exit, if you can. If you're really 
good, you can do this in 21 moves.

Solution: Well, I just follow my general strategy of starting in 
the lower/left and moving counter-clockwise, freeing up space as 
I do so. I also tried to get the red ball into the upper/right 
hand corner as one of my goals in hopes that was part of the 
best strategy. 

1. Move the leftmost purple block down.
2. Move the second-from-left purple block left.
3. Move the bottom blue block left.
4. Move the right green block down twice.
5. Move the rightmost purple block down twice.
6. Move the second-from-right purple block right and down.
7. Move the upper blue block right twice.
8. Move the red ball down and right.
9. Move the left green block up twice.
10. Move the yellow block left.
11. Move the up-most purple block left and down.
12. Move the up-most blue block down.
13. Move the red ball into the upper/right hand corner. Yes! 
Progress!
14. Move the upper blue block up and left twice.
15. Move the red ball down twice and left.
16. Move the rightmost purple block up three times, into the 
corner.
17. Time to switch the red ball with the purple block next to 
it. Move the red ball right once.
18. Move the purple block up once.
19. Move the red ball down and left.
20. Move the green block up three times.
21. Move the red ball to the exit.

Woah...I stumbled upon the quickest strategy? Amazing!

Puzzle #095: A Magic Square
---------------------------
Location: Tower Floor 2
Examine: Locked Door
--------------------

Summary: We have a partially completed magic square. Complete 
it, please.

Solution: 'Tis not too hard. The five must go in the middle, and 
8 goes with 2 and 1 with 9 to get those parts of the magic 
square balanced. That's half the numbers already in place for 
you!

2 9 4
7 5 3
6 1 8

Puzzle #096: Take the Stairs
----------------------------
Location: Tower Floor 3
Character: Pavel
----------------

Summary: You're in a ten story building. It took 48 seconds to 
go from the 1st to 4th floor. How many seconds will it take to 
go from the 4th to the 8th? 

Solution: 64 seconds. It must take 16 seconds to climb each 
floor. The "trick" to the puzzle is realizing that 8 – 4 = 4, 
whereas 4 – 1 = 3. So going from the first to fourth floor is 
only going up three staircases, while going from fourth to 
eighth is going up four.

Ah, the joys of mathematical and logical deduction...

Puzzle #097: Princess in a Box 1
--------------------------------
Location: Tower Floor 4
Examine: Locked Door
--------------------

Summary: You're not tired of slider puzzles yet, are you? Good! 
Here's another one. Get the red block to the right-hand side of 
the screen.

Solution: Complicated puzzles. Let me try to simplify the 
explanation by breaking it up into little parts. When I say use 
numbers to describe rows (like "third row"), I mean third from 
the top. When I do the same for columns (like "second column"), 
I mean second from the left.

Part 1 – Get the purple block in the upper/right hand corner by 
moving it and a bunch of green blocks.

1. Move the second row green block right and down.
2. Move the left, third row green block up and right.
3. Move the purple block right.
4. Move the leftmost, top row green block down twice.
5. Move the leftmost, top row green block left once, down once.
6. Move the leftmost, top row green block left twice.
7. Move the purple block up once.
8. Move the rightmost, third row green block left.
9. Move the rightmost, second row green block down.
10. Move the purple block right.

Part 2 – Get the blue blocks together in the upper/left hand 
corner. This involves moving the bottom blue block to the right, 
and bringing it up while moving the purple block down and red 
block right to fill in the empty spots you create.

11. Move the fourth column green block up twice.
12. Move the fourth column green block up twice.
13. Move the leftmost, bottommost green block right once and up 
once.
14. Move the bottom blue block right twice.
15. Move the red block down once.
16. Move the leftmost, second row green block left.
17. Move the second-from-left, second row green block left.
18. Move the leftmost, third row green block up.
19. Move the second-from-left, second row green block up.
20. Move the bottommost blue block up.
21. Move the bottommost green block left twice. 
22. Move the rightmost green block down and left.
23. Move the purple block down twice.
24/25. Move the upper row green blocks right.
25. Move the third-from-left column green block up.
26. Move the second row, fourth column green block right.
27. Move the bottom blue block up.
28. Move the bottom, left green block up and right.
29. Move the red block right.
30. Move the leftmost green block down twice.
31. Move the second row, leftmost green block left and down.
32. Move the lower blue block left twice.

Your strategy now will be to move the blue blocks down to the 
bottom/left hand corner. This will free up space to move the red 
block right and up.

33. Move the third row right green block up and left.
34. Move the third row green block up twice.
35. Move the red block right.
36. Move the left column, upper green block right and down.
37. Move the lower blue block down.
38. Move the upper blue block down.
39. Move the leftmost, top row green block left twice.
40. Move the top row, second-from-left block left twice.
41/2. Move the second row of green blocks up. 
43. Move the red block up.
44/5. Move the bottom row of green blocks right. 
46/7. Move the blue blocks down.

Now, just move that red block up and right, and move the purple 
block down and left.

48/9. Move the two green blocks in the upper/left down once.
50. Move the top row, leftmost green block left twice.
51. Move the top row, second-from-right green block left twice.
52. Move the red block up.
53. Move the bottom row, rightmost green block up and left.
54. Move the purple block left.
55/56. Move the rightmost column of green blocks down twice.
57. Move the red block right.
58/9. Move the third-from-right column of green blocks up.
60. Move the purple block left.
61. Move the second-from-bottom green block left and down.
62. Move the red block down, right, and OUTTA THERE!

Puzzle #098: Card Order
-----------------------
Location: Tower Floor 5
Character: Martha
-----------------

Summary: There are five cards here. Arrange them in the correct 
order.

1. The club is right of the heart.
2. The spade is not next to the diamond or joker.
3. The club is not next to the joker or diamond.
4. The heart is not next to the diamond or spade.

Solution: Simple enough, especially when you combine clues 2 
through 4 to get a new rule: The diamond is not next to the 
spade, club or heart. The diamond, therefore, must be next to 
the joker, so it must be on either the left or right end of the 
table.

The order is diamond, joker, heart, club, spade.

Puzzle #099: 33333!
-------------------
Location: Tower Floor 6
Examine: Locked Door
--------------------

Summary: Arrange the digits 1-9 in a subtraction problem to 
result in 33,333.

Solution: You can do either 41268 – 7935 or 41286 – 7953.

Almost done! Just one more puzzle between you and the Golden 
Apple!

Puzzle #100: Seven Squares
--------------------------
Location: Tower Floor 7
Examine: Locked Door
--------------------

Summary: Make seven squares on the pinboard. Use each pin once.

Solution:

1. The first square is in the upper/left corner. Take those four 
pins in the upper/left and use them to form a square. This will 
be the only non-tilted square.
2. Make a line between the two pins in the lower/left hand 
corner. This is the side of the next square. Form the complete 
square, and an empty pin will be right in the center of the 
square.
3. There are three squares the same size of square #2. The next 
one is formed in the upper/right corner. A line between those 
two pegs forms the side of the square.
4. This square is the same size/position as squares 2 and 3. It 
will be right of square two, but up a peg. That's the only place 
you can place a square of that size.
5. Draw a line, connecting the center of the upper/right square 
with the center of the middle/right square. That's a side of 
square 5.
6. Square 6 will take up the leftmost peg, the bottommost peg, 
the rightmost peg and the topmost peg. It's what I like to call 
a "big" square.
7. Make a square with the four remaining pins.

All right! You have now solved all 120 puzzles in St. Mystere! 
Unless you're like me, and skipped some. If that's the case, go 
through your puzzle index and figure out which puzzles you 
missed, do a search for that puzzle number on this webpage to 
locate where it is, then go back and solve it! 

Okay, so head up the stairs to see...a cottage? On top of the 
tower? How curious!

The game will ask you if you want to continue inside the 
cottage, or if you want to go back to the village. The game 
automatically saves here; if you go forward and beat the game, 
you restart from this point.
The chapter officially ends here, if you're wondering.

Go inside the meet the mystery woman, who reveals herself as 
Flora. Flora is the Golden Apple! The whole thing was a set-up 
by Baron Reinhold to find a suitable guardian for his daughter.

Don Paolo then attacks by means of a destructive flying machine, 
the fiend. Luke, Layton and Flora attempt to escape, but only 
Luke makes it out! Fortunately, Layton has an idea.

Professor Layton creates a makeshift flying machine. It's more 
of a glider, designed to take him and Flora down in safety. Don 
Paolo, who has some anger issues, attacks, fails and swears 
revenge.

Flora and the Professor make a semi-dangerous landing, but they 
end up okay. Flora hugs Professor Layton and smiles, revealing a 
curious birthmark. One that's shaped...like an apple!

The Professor quickly heads to Reinhold Manor and asks Luke to 
locate the apple on Flora's portrait. It's a hidden button! 
Pressing it opens up a secret passage that contains the Baron's 
fortune. Flora decides not to take all of the fortune so the 
curious village can remain open.

The game isn't over yet, folks. There are several bonus puzzles 
you get for doing things during the game.

004-Gizmos
-----------------------------------------------------------

Video #34: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6LHlovAdto

Early on in the game, Professor Layton learns about gizmos from 
Franco. When you solve certain puzzles in the game, you get 
gizmos. Specifically, you get gizmos from puzzles 16, 19, 20, 
21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37 38, 40 and 
41.

Once you have all the gizmos, open up Professor Layton's trunk 
and solve the gizmo puzzle by tapping on all the pieces in any 
order you want. This will result in a robot dog who will sniff 
out hint coins for you.

As a reward, Professor Layton opens up the Inventor's House in 
the bonuses section of the game. Save your game, and the next 
time you turn on your DS, you can access these puzzles.

005-Furniture
-----------------------------------------------------------

Video #35: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFrlT-skerY

You get pieces of furniture for solving certain puzzles in the 
game. Specifically, the pieces of furniture come from solving 
puzzles 18, 33, 43, 46, 47, 49, 50, 53, 55, 56, 57, 61, 63, 69, 
71, 72, 73, 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 89, 91, 103, 104 and 
109.

But that's not all! You have to figure out which pieces of 
furniture go with which character, based on how much they like 
their furniture.

Luke gets the teddy bear, the blue bed, the cream rug, the 
simple chair, the desk, the telly, the bookcase, the pile of 
books, the world map, the violin, the globe and the reading 
lamp. Layton gets all the other items.

Solving this puzzle gets you three bonus puzzles.

Puzzle #124: Missing Number
---------------------------

Summary: What number is missing from the sequence 12311_1213?

he gets a 6, he says 20. What does he say when he gets a 3?

Solution: He says 17, the number of visible dots on the die.

Puzzle #126: Red and Blue 2
---------------------------

Summary: Can you switch the red and blue balls while keeping 
them in the proper order?

Solution: Sure, you can! It's just like Red and Blue 1, only 
this time all you have to do is switch the order of the balls. 
Specifically, switch the blue balls around so they read D B A C. 
Then, move the A ball to the upper/middle spot.

Move the red C and D balls to the right, and move the blue A in 
the lower/left. Then move the red A and B balls out of the way 
to the right so you can move the blue A ball to the upper/left 
part.

Now you'll want to do the same thing--get the red A ball in the 
upper/right. Move it to the middle/upper spot, move other balls 
out of the way and move it to the red D spot. Move more balls 
out of the way, and move the red A to the A spot.

Now the red and blue A balls are in place. You don't have to 
move them again. This is half the challenge to this puzzle.

Move the blue B to the middle/upper spot. Move the balls around 
so you can move it into the Blue B spot. Do the same with the 
red B. Don't move them ever again.

Now get Blue D in place, Red D in place, and slide Blue C and 
Red C into place.

....q...

Puzzle #131: Heavier or Lighter?
--------------------------------

Summary: You have 12 weights. 11 are the same weight, but one is 
different. Can you figure out which one it is in only 3 
weighings?

Solution: Woah. So. Tough. Let me go through all the possible 
results, and hope I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Weigh 1, 2, 3 and 4 against 5, 6, 7 and 8. This results in...

1a. 1/2/3/4 side is lighter.
1b. 5/6/7/8 side is lighter.
1c. The two are equal.


If you have 1a, you know the odd weight is one of the weights 
from 1 to 8. The way to figure out which one is the odd one is 
by switching them up a bit. Weigh 1, 2 and 12 against 3, 4 and 
5. This has three possible results.

1a-2a. 1/2/12 side is lighter.
1a-2b. 3/4/5 side is lighter.
1a-2c. The two are equal.


If you have 1a-2a, you know the odd weight out is not 3, 4 or 5. 
Why? When you moved them in weighing #2, the scales remained 
unchanged. Also, weights 6, 7 and 8 are not the answer, 
otherwise, the scales would balance with the odd weight having 
been taken off.

So it's weight 1 or 2. Weigh 1 VS 2, and the lighter one is the 
answer.


If 1a-2b, you know that the odd weight out must be 3 or 4, 
because when you moved them from the left to the right in 
weighing #2, the scales changed. Also, you know that you are 
looking for a lighter weight, as moving 3 and 4 resulted in the 
3/4/5 side being lighter than 1/2/12. So, weigh 3 VS 4. The 
lighter one if the one you want.


If you have 1a-2c, you know that the odd weight is either 6, 7 
or 8, because 9-12 were eliminated in the first weighing, and 
moving 1-5 in weighing #2 had no effect. Further, because 
1/2/3/4 was lighter than 5/6/7/8 is weighing #1, the weight 
you're looking for is a heavier weight. Therefore, weigh 6 VS 7.

1a-2c-3a. 6 is lighter.
1a-2c-3b. 7 is lighter.
1a-2c-3c. The two are equal.

If 1a-2c-3a, 7 is the odd weight out.
If 1a-2c-3a, 6 is the odd weight out.
If 1a-2c-3a, 8 is the odd weight out.

---

If you have 1b, you know the odd weight is one of the weights 
from 1 to 8. The way to figure out which one is the odd one is 
by switching them up a bit. Weigh 1, 2 and 12 against 3, 4 and 
5. This has three possible results.

1b. 5/6/7/8 is lighter than 1/2/3/4.

1b-2a. 1/2/12 is lighter.
1b-2b. 3/4/5 is lighter.
2b-2c. The two are equal.


If 1b-2a, you know that 2 and 3 aren't the odd weight, as moving 
them from one side to the other did not affect the slope. You 
also know 6, 7 and 8 are not the odd weight, as removing them 
didn't cause the scales to balance. So, the odd weight is 1, 4 
or 5.

Weigh 1 and 5 against 10 and 11. This has three results.

1b-2a-3a. 1/5 is lighter than 10/11.
1b-2a-3b. 10/11 is lighter than 1/5.
1b-2a-3c. 1/5 = 10/11.


If 1b-2a-3a, you just learned the odd weight out (1 or 5) is 
lighter than 10/11. Therefore, you're looking for a lighter 
weight. 5 was lighter than 1 in Weighing #1, ergo, 5 is the 
answer.

If 1b-2a-3b, you just learned that the odd weight out (1 or 5) 
is heavier than 10/11. Ergo, you're looking for a heavier 
weight. 1 was heavier than 5 in Weighing #1, therefore, 1 is the 
answer.

If 1b-2a-3c, you just learned that 1 and 5 equal 10 and 11. 
Ergo, 1 and 5 are not the odd weight out, as they equal the non-
odd weights. 4 is the odd weight out.


If you got 1b-2b, you learned that the odd weight out is not 3 
or 4, as moving those two did not tip the scales. So 1, 2 or 5 
must be the odd weight.

Weight 1/5 VS 10/11. This has three possible results.

1b-2b-3a. 1/5 is lighter than 10/11.
1b-2b-3b. 10/11 is lighter than 1/5.
1b-2b-3c. 1/5 = 10/11.

If 1b-2b-3a, the weight you're looking for is a light one, as 1 
and 5 are lighter than 10/11 (weights that are not the odd one). 
Weighing #1 says 5 is lighter than 1, so 5 is the odd weight 
out.

If 1b-2b-3b, the weight you're looking for is a heavier one, as 
1 and 5 are heavier than 10/11 (weights that are not the odd 
one). Weighing #1 says that 1 is heavier than 5, so 1 is the odd 
weight out.

If 1b-2b-3c, 1 and 5 cannot be the odd weight, as they both 
equal 10 and 11 (also not odd weights, as proved by Weighing 
#1). Therefore, 2 must be the odd weight out.


If you have 1b-2c, you know that the odd weight out is 6, 7 or 
8. When you moved them off the scales, the scales balanced. 
Further, you now know that you're looking for a light weight, as 
6, 7 and 8 were all on the lighter side during Weighing #1.

Weight 6 VS 7.

1b-2c-3a. 6 is lighter.
1b-2c-3b. 7 is lighter.
1b-2c-3c. They are the same.

If 1b-2c-3a, 6 is the odd weight.
If 1b-2c-3b, 7 is the odd weight.
If 1b-2c-3c, 8 is the odd weight.

---

If you have 1c, you know that the odd weight is 9, 10, 11 or 12. 
Weigh 9, 10 and 11 versus 1, 2 and 3. This has three possible 
results.

1c–2a. 9/10/11 side is lighter.
1c–2b. 1/2/3 side is lighter.
1c–2c. The two sides are equal.


If you have 1c–2a, it means the odd weight out is either 9, 10 
or 11. It also means the odd weight is lighter than the other 
eleven weights. Weigh 9 VS 10.

If 9 is lighter, 9 is the odd weight out.
If 10 is lighter, 10 is the odd weight out.
If 9 = 10, 11 is the odd weight out.


If you have 1c-2b, it means the odd weight out is either 9, 10 
or 11. It also means the odd weight is heavier than the other 
eleven weights. Weight 9 VS 10.

If 9 is lighter, 9 is the odd weight out.
If 10 is lighter, 10 is the odd weight out.
If 9 = 10, 11 is the odd weight out.


If you have 1c-2c, you've figured out that weights 1-11 are all 
the same weight. 12 is the odd weight out.

Puzzle #132: Princess in a Box 2
--------------------------------

Summary: You solved the other puzzles in this game, so you must 
be a glutton for punishment. Can you get the red block out of 
this puzzle?

Solution: This is the same as Princess in a Box 1, only with two 
purple blocks. Sigh... Let me try to simplify the explanation by 
breaking it up into little parts. When I say use numbers to 
describe rows (like "third row"), I mean third from the top. 
When I do the same for columns (like "second column"), I mean 
second from the left.

32. Move the top row, left green block down and right.
33. Move the red block right.
34. Move the third row green block up twice.

008-The Puzzle Master's House
-----------------------------------------------------------

Video #38: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bODJfo-K_A

Okay, so you beat all the puzzles in the game, including the 
above-discussed bonus puzzles. When this happens, you get three 
final puzzles to whet your appetite.

Puzzle #133: Finish the Equation
--------------------------------

Summary: Place 3, 4, 7 and 8 into the equation (_ - (_ / _)) x _ 
= 10.

Solution: (3 – (7/4)) X 8 = 10. The equation is deliberately 
misleading with where it places the "divided by" sign. Harrumph.

Puzzle #134: Land Disputes
-------------------------- 

Summary: Four people want the 6 by 6 area divided into four 
parts, each the same shape, and each having a house and well. 
Can you make the proper divisions? 

Solution: The proper shape is this...

 X  X
XXX X
  XXX

Kind of an odd shape, but four of them, one in each corner, will 
perfectly fill the board.

Puzzle #135: Royal Escape
------------------------- 

Summary: So, it's Princess in a Box with more blue blocks. This 
is actually a famous French puzzle called "The Red Donkey", 
although I suppose it's slightly more elegant for them to use a 
princess instead of a donkey here.

Solution: Again, I'll try to simplify things by taking it in 
steps. When I say use numbers to describe rows (like "third 
row"), I mean third from the top. When I do the same for columns 
(like "second column"), I mean second from the left.

009-UK Exclusive Puzzles

Video #39: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz40MW7lpAc

Those of you who played the UK version of the game might have 
noticed some of the puzzles are different. Actually, there are 
16 puzzles that were changed for the UK release, and this 
section covers them.

Some of the puzzles have different names for the UK release, but 
are essentially the same. I'm not going to cover which puzzles 
those are, because this guide is long enough already.

Puzzle #005: Clock Hands 
------------------------ 
Location: Plaza
Examine: Clock Tower
--------------------

Summary: An analogue clock has two hands, and occasionally, the 
two hands line up perfectly. How many times does this happen 
between 12 noon and 12 midnight?

Solution: This happens once an hour, or ten times. 12 noon and 
12 midnight don't count as answers.

Puzzle #010: Four Digits
------------------------ 
Location: Manor Foyer
Examine: Books
--------------

Summary: You have four one-digit numbers. A + C = D, A X B = C, 
C – B = B, A X 4 = D. What is ABCD?

Solution: 2368. A = 2, B = 3, C = 6, D = 8. The best way to 
figure this out is be realizing D must be 4 or 8, and A must be 
1 or 2, based off the last equation, as D cannot be a double-
digit number.

Puzzle #113: Pet Menagerie
-------------------------- 
Location: Entrance
Examine: Inn Sign
-----------------

Summary: A boy has ten pets: dogs, snakes, tortoises and 
canaries. The pets have six wings, three shells and twenty-six 
legs in all. How many snakes are there?

Solution: Six wings means three canaries, three shells means 
three turtles. Those account for eighteen feet. 26-18=8, so the 
dogs and snakes must have eight feet in total. Snakes have no 
feet, so that means there are two dogs.

Ten pets in all minus two dogs minus three canaries minus three 
turtles equals two snakes.

Puzzle #045: Lunar Weight
-------------------------
Location: Park Road
Character: Adrea
----------------

Summary: Gravity on the moon is 1/6 of that on Earth. If you 
weigh a 600 gram weight on the moon, what will it weigh?

Solution: The answer is B, less than 100 grams. This is because 
the scale itself weighs less on the moon, so its starting weight 
will be less than zero (whereas on Earth, it will have zero as a 
starting weight).

Puzzle #046: Star in the Sky
----------------------------
Location: Park Gate
Character: Deke
---------------

Summary: How many triangles are in this picture?

you reach?

person. B borrowed from A, E did not lend to A, and C lent to D. 
Who did A borrow from?

Solution: The clues say that A did not borrow from B, E and C. A 
did not borrow from himself, so he must have borrowed from D, 
the only remaining character.

Puzzle #067: How Many Sweets?
----------------------------- 
Location: Clock Tower
Character: Lucy
---------------

Summary: Three boys are talking about their sweets. B has the

Solution: 9 sweets. B has 3, C has 1, A has 5.

Puzzle #085: Train Speed
------------------------ 
Location: Outside the Sewer
Examine: Laytonmobile

Puzzle #088: Leaky Tank
----------------------- 
Location: Shack Path
Character: Sylvain
------------------

Summary: A 2.5m deep water tank is being filled 60cm per day, 
and leaks 20cm per night, so overall, it fills up 40cm per day. 
How long does it take for the tank to overflow?

Solution: 6 days. The "trick" is that on this day, it is filled 
to 2.6, and leaks to 2.4 that night. Some people might think Day 
6 is not the answer, as 2.4 is less than 2.5, but that is not 
the case.

Puzzle #096: On the Stairs
-------------------------- 
Location: Tower Floor 3
Character: Pavel
----------------

Summary: We have four men on the stairs: Jim, Mike, Steven and

_are_ next to each other, and Tom is higher up than Steve. Which 
one is Jim?

Solution: Jim is on the lowest step. D.

used?

Puzzle #124: The Rope Ladder
---------------------------- 
Location: Decorator's House
Location: Bonus Puzzles Section

the ninth rung, and it rises at 40cm an hour. The rungs are 30cm 
apart. In three hours, which rung will the water be under?

and so will the ladder hanging off the boat.
