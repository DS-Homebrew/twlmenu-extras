BE SURE TO READ THIS FIRST PART!
You can read this faq as long as
you don't change ANY part of it
(including this small
introduction). Also, you can
print it but only for use at
your home, you may NEVER sell
this stuff or else you will make
me really mad and maybe I won't
work anymore! Finally, if you
want to use this faq on your
site (or use any part of it for
other things, like writing your
own faq or something) you have
to mail me and ask me for it, I
will almost surely grant it to
you! Finally, this guide may
NEVER be published in CheatCC.

1~. Introduction

This title marks the first time
that Sonic and Mario, two old
rivals, can confront each other
in the field. However, be aware
that all characters are slightly
less powerful than usual. Sonic,
for example, is still a fast
runner, but he won't be you
won't see him magically winning
all the races, and Mario doesn't
perform miraculous jumps.
Instead, they're given stats
based on their proficiency in
certain areas, which is more
than fair. Now, Mario and Sonic
come with tons of different
comrades, each with unique
stats, and you'll be using them
all to participate in some kind
of Olympic Games, where all the
events are played via mini-
games. Not all Olympic
modalities are depicted in this
game, but the ones here
available all play in an unique
way, and even if the gameplay
ends up being rather predictable
and possibly gets old after a
while, that is where Wi-fi
gameplay ends up being
important, as it allows you to
compare your own records with
those of other players from all
over the world, always giving
you new records to outdo. This
guide tries to cover as much of
the game as possible, and if
you're having any problems with
any part of the game, be sure to
read the proper section of the
guide. I'm not able to give you
magical solutions, but at least
I'll try to give you deep hints
on how to beat particular events
or achieve certain prizes.



2~. Main Menu

After popping the game into your
console, you can press start to
actually begin all the
competition. If you've already
created your own game, you can
simply load its slot, but by
selecting an empty slot you'll
be able to input your own name
and choose a flag for your slot.
These choices aren't that
important offline, but be aware
that they play a more important
role online (if you later feel
like changing them, you can do
so by acessing the "Options"
menu, as stated later in this
guide). Once you've picked your
main slot, you'll finally see
the main menu, filled with tons
of different options, as
described below.



2.1~. Single Player

There's not much I can tell you
about this option... obviously
available in the main menu, this
is the one you should pick if
you want to spend some time
playing this game by yourself.
The options that you're allowed
to pick are described next.



2.1.1~. Single Match

By picking this option, you're
allowed to select a single event
(see the listing later in this
guide) and one character, and
you're allowed to change some of
its options by pressing "Set
Rules" before the actual event.
Obviously, you should try to win
that event with the character
you've chosen, and if you manage
to do it you'll unlock a medal.
Being the third best awards a
bronze medal, the second best is
given a silver medal and the top
performer is graciously offered
a gold medal, just like in the
real Olympic Games. Be aware
that all those medals are stored
in the very same place, i.e. you
don't have to collect them all,
and once a character gets a gold
medal for a specific event there
is no need to replay it in order
to get the other two medals, as
they're just unnecessary by
then.



2.1.2~. Circuit

Possibly one of the biggest
single options that this game
has to offer, this is the mode
that you'll have to play if you
want to unlock more events than
the ones acessible initially.
The game has 16 different
circuits to enjoy, plus one that
allows you to compose your very
own circuit. The enemies you
fight in each circuit are
random, and if you just don't
like what you're seeing (i.e.
they are too strong for you),
you can simply exit that option
- by returning there later on,
you'll be facing different
characters. Also, I must give
you an important note concerning
these circuits - even though you
must qualify in the first
position to earn that circuits'
trophy, if you're simply wanting
to unlock the next circuit (or
new events), you just need to
complete it in the first three
positions, a task which is
easier to perform. Finally,
you're usually allowed to use a
coin before each event. Doing so
basically doubles the points
that you earn with that event,
and I strongly suggest you use
it only when you're sure that
you can get the very first
position for that event, as
doing so will give you an
important 20 points, which may
be the difference between
qualifying in the first or
second spots for a particular
circuit. If you have this is
mind, you will have an easier
time with all circuits, just be
sure to bet on events that
you're sure that you can win.
Next, a quick reference to all
the 17 (actually, 16 + 1)
circuits this game has to
offer...



2.1.2.1~. Beginner's Class -
Mercury Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m

----- Long Jump

----- Hammer Throw

In order to face this first
circuit, I suggest you pick a
Speed Type character, possibly
"Shadow", since he is not only a
fast runner but also has some
power and fair skill.



2.1.2.2~. Beginner's Class -
Venus Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m Freestyle

----- Shooting

----- Table Tennis

Here, you may want to pick a
character that has good skill
and speed, such as "Peach".



2.1.2.3~. Beginner's Class -
Jupiter Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Cycling

----- Fencing

----- 400m

Power and speed are clear
requisites for facing this
circuit, which turn both "Sonic"
and "Shadow" into good options.



2.1.2.4~. Beginner's Class -
Saturn Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Trampoline

----- Archery

----- Javelin Throw

Due to its configuration, your
best choice here is possibly one
of the all-around characters.
I'm not mentioning any names,
since they're all very close to
each other, and you're free to
pick the one you like the most.
Personally, I picked "Mario"
just for fun, but there may be
other options, ones that better
fit your personal taste.



2.1.2.5~. Beginner's Class -
Moonlight Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 400m Hurdles

----- Triple Jump

----- Dream Table Tennis

For the last circuit of this
first class, I suggest you pick
an all-around character that has
high Speed and Stamina. "Amy",
for example, is a good option.



2.1.2.6~. Advanced Class -
Stardust Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m

----- Long Jump

----- Hammer Throw

----- Vault

Due to her high speed and skill,
"Peach" is probably one of the
best characters that you can
pick for this circuit.



2.1.2.7~. Advanced Class -
Planet Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m Freestyle

----- Shooting

----- Table Tennis

----- Dream Basketball

As before, "Peach" is a good
option for this one, but "Wario"
may also end up being a good
choice.



2.1.2.8~. Advanced Class - Comet
Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Cycling

----- Fencing

----- 400m

----- Dream Race

With so many speed-related
events, you could feel like
picking one of those speedy
characters, but be aware they
also tend to have low stamina,
which is a problem. So, one of
your best options ends up being
"Knuckles", a character who has
fair speed and good stamina.



2.1.2.9~. Advanced Class -
Satellite Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Trampoline

----- Archery

----- Javelin Throw

----- 10m Platform

Someone with high skill and some
power is a good option here,
someone just like "Waluigi".



2.1.2.10~. Advanced Class -
Sunlight Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 400m Hurdles

----- Triple Jump

----- Dream Table Tennis

----- Dream Fencing

An all-around character, such as
"Mario", ends up being one of
the best options for this
circuit.



2.1.2.11~. Master's Class -
Meteorite Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m

----- Long Jump

----- Hammer Throw

----- Vault

----- Dream Canoe

"Mario", once more, is a good
option, but so is "Knuckles".



2.1.2.12~. Master's Class -
Supernova Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m Freestyle

----- Shooting

----- Table Tennis

----- Dream Basketball

----- Dream Boxing

Since you won't be needing much
stamina, "Shadow" is a good
option for this circuit. "Wario"
also works just fine.



2.1.2.13~. Master's Class -
Cosmos Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- cycling

----- Fencing

----- 400m

----- Dream Race

----- Dream Shooting

Speed, stamina and (some) power
play an important role here, and
"Blaze" ends up being a good
option.



2.1.2.14~. Master's Class -
Galaxy Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Trampoline

----- Archery

----- Javelin Throw

----- 10m Platform

----- Dream Long Jump

Some with high skill and some
power is a good option here,
someone like "Waluigi".



2.1.2.15~. Master's Class -
Universal Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 400m Hurdles

----- Triple Jump

----- Archery

----- Dream Table Tennis

----- Dream Fencing

"Mario", "Blaze" or "Sonic" are
good options.



2.1.2.16~. Master's Class - Big
Bang Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Dream Boxing

----- Dream Canoe

----- Dream Basketball

----- Dream Long Jump

----- Dream Race

Here, it is not a matter of who
you pick, but how you play.
Going for an all-around
character may be a good idea,
but it is really up to your
personal preferences, since
you'll always have some
strenghts and weaknesses in the
events stated above. "Luigi" did
it for me, after a couple tries,
but you should be very careful
with your opponents, since they
are a lot stronger than in the
past events. If you bet on an
event which you're sure that you
can win, you'll have an easier
time with all the others, and
that's something to be very
careful about, as it may take
you a while to gain the skill
necessary to successfully
complete this unusual circuit.



2.1.2.17~. Free

Unlike what happens in the other
16 circuits, which have all
their events set in stone, here
it is up to you to you pick what
you want to play. You can either
let the console assign random
ones or pick up to five by
yourself, it's rather simple,
and if you pick a wrong option
you can always go back by
pressing "B" - something that is
useful either if you dislike
what the console picked or if
you want to correct some of the
previous choices you made. Even
though there's not really a
purpose behind this mode, it is
a good way to test particular
characters against a certain
circuit, without having to try
tons of different events one by
one.



2.1.3~. Mission

By selecting this option, you'll
be allowed to play five missions
unique to each character. Once
one of your characters completes
all five, he (or she) will
receive a unique emblem, symbol
of his achievement, and that is
basically it. For more
information on what you have to
do in each mission, along with
basic strategies for all of
those, check the "Characters"
section of this very same guide.



2.2~. Versus Play

When you select this option,
your console will instantly try
to connect to other consoles
that have the game, in order to
play against them, but by
selecting "Create Group" you
will also be able to play
against people who don't have
this game, via Download Play. If
you're playing against other
folks who have the game, you'll
be able to pick any events (or
circuits) that the host has
unlocked, but when playing
against folks who don't have the
game you can only access six
different events - 100m, Long
Jump, Trampoline, Archery, Dream
Basketball and Dream Canoe.
Next, you can all pick an unique
character (no, you can't have
multiple people picking "Sonic",
"Mario" or anyone else) and, if
less than four people are
playing, the console assigns the
two other slots to opponents
controlled by the CPU. That's as
far as it goes, but at least
they're not making you pay for
multiple carts in order to have
some quick fun with your
friends.



2.3~. Records

Picking this option just leads
to its submenu, where you can
see all the records that your
characters have set.



2.3.1~. Records

Just as stated above, by picking
this option you're taken to a
place where, given a specific
event, you're allowed to see all
the records that people using
your cart have set, along with
the character they've chosen
back when they set that
particular record.



2.3.2~. Nintendo WFC Rankings

Provided you have access to a
wireless connection to the
internet, you can use this
option to compare your own
records against other players
from all over the world, just
enter this mode and press start
to update all your records. Be
aware that there is no real way
to play online against other
fellows who have the game, and
this is what better resembles
such option.



2.3.3~. Collection

By selecting this option, you
can access a place where you'll
see the many in-game awards that
this game has to offer, and
check which ones you've already
collected.



2.3.3.1~. Medals

Here you can see all medals that
your characters currently have.
Be aware that medals are unique
to each character, and you can
unlock new ones by achieving
victories (first, second or
third places) in the "Single
Match" mode. Here are the medals
that each of your characters can
get:.

the "Single Match" mode.



2.3.3.2~. Trophies

Trophies, however, are
independent from your
characters, and fit a specific
player profile. In order to
unlock new ones, you have to be

task and you'll unlock each of
these Crowns.



2.3.4~. Nintendo WFC Settings

Useful only if you've never
played any Wi-fi enabled titles,
or if you need to change
something, this option allows
you to configure your Wi-fi
settings, which are independent
from the game you're playing,
and are set in your console
firmware. If you're having
trouble with this part of your
configuration, be sure to check
Nintendo's Wi-fi website, which
is usually available at
http://www.nintendowifi.com/ .



2.4~. Gallery

Possibly an option that may be
unappeling to some players, you
can here play some mini-games
which, upon completion, unveil
some interesting facts on the
Olympic Games and subjects
related to them, trivia which is
also mentioned in this guide.
Also, there are more than five
different mini-games, with
increasing difficulty modes, and
that is basically it, as you'll
be able to read below.



2.4.1~. Olympic Trivia

In this mini-game, you will see
a sequence in the upper screen,
and you'll have to follow that
very same sequence in the lower
screen, by quickly tapping the
same jewels which were activated
in the upper screen. As you
advanced in levels, you'll see
more jewels and the sequences
will become more complex, but
you should be aware that only
have to score five points in
each level to advance to the
next one. Complete all five
different levels in order to
unlock all the information and
two CDs (one for Sonic team and
one for the Mario team), which
you can play in the Jukebox.
Now, some trivia connected to
this minigame:


Q: Which colors are used for the
five rings of the Olympic
symbol?

A: In order, they are blue,
yellow, black, red, and green.
At least one of
   these five colors is used in 


Q: How do they determine
countries and locations where
the Olympic Games
   will be held?

A: The Host City for each
Olympic Games is chosen from
among the candidate
   cities by a vote of the Inter


Q: Which continent hasn't been
host to the modern Olympic
Games?

A: The modern Olympic Games
haven't been held in Africa.


Q: How is the Olympic flame lit?

A: The Olympic flame is lit by
the sun's rays in Olympia,
Greece.


Q: Which team marches last in
the Opening Ceremony?

A: The team representing the
host country marches last.


That's all for this section....



2.4.2~. Modern Olympic Games

In this mini-game, you have to
throw the green shell to the
upper screen, so that it hits as
many opponents as possible. Be
aware of Boos (they can only be
hit when they're fully visible)
and Bob-ombs (they explode on
impact, destroying your shell),
but everyone else is just safe
to hit at all times. As you
advance in levels, tougher
enemies will appear, but you
only have to score 10 points in
order to unlock the next level.
Complete all five different
levels in order to unlock all
the information and two CDs (one
for Sonic team and one for the
Mario team), which you can play
in the Jukebox. Now, some trivia
connected to this minigame:


Q: Where were the Games of the
first Olympiad held?

A: They were held in Athens,
Greece.


Q: When was the first Olympic
torch relay?

A: The torch relay was
introduced in the 1936 Berlin
Olympic Games.


Q: Which Olympic Games were the
first to be broadcast on TV?

A: The 1936 Olympic Games in
Berlin.


Q: Were there ever non-sports
events in the modern Olympic

2.4.3~. Beijing 2008

Here, instead of facing a single
mini-game, you will be finding
three different ones, all based
on cards. The first (and the
forth) one makes you match the
card seen in the upper screen
with one from a group seen in
the lower screen. Later, the
game becomes harder, and you'll
have less time to find the right
one. The second (and the fifth)
one makes you match pairs from
the cards displayed on the
field. There is no easy way out
of that one, and you'll be
probably relying on luck and
your own memory. The third game
simply makes you keep track of a
certain card, and then moves
them all across the board. In
the end, you must point to the
right card. Be aware that the
number of points required for
each mini-game (and level)
deeply varies, and you must
complete all five different
games in order to unlock all the
information and two CDs (one for
Sonic team and one for the Mario
team), which you can play in the
Jukebox. Now, some trivia

split the enemies that come in
the conveyor belt to the proper

grab each of the enemies and
drag them to the proper place.
As you advance to the higher
levels, more boxes will appear
and the conveyor belt will start
moving faster, but 15 points are
usually enough to complete each
level. Complete all five
different levels in order to

two CDs (one for Sonic team and

2.4.6~. Jukebox

In this Jukebox you're allowed
to listen to some classical
songs from the Sonic and Mario
series. At first, you'll be
stuck with the gallery's theme
song, from this very same game,
which has an image of the
Parthenon, but as you complete
the mini-games mentioned above
you will unlock new CDs to
listen to, each containing a
different theme song from the
Mario and Sonic series. Apart
from that, there's not much else
to do here. Next, is a reference
to all the songs that you can
unlock:


Mario songs (left side of the

2.5~. Options (Audio Settings,
User Settings and Microphone
Test)

Ah... the classical "Options"
mode. I really hope you know
what this one is all about, or
else maybe you shouldn't be
playing this title. As always,
this option enables you to tune
up some of the gameplay areas,
such as its sound, and it isn't
really important. More often
than not, it is the kind of
thing you'll always try to
ignore.

"Audio Settings" enables you to
change the volume of certain in-
game sounds, such as the music,
sound effects and voices.

"User Settings" makes it
possible for you to change the
name associated to your profile,
the country flag associated to
your profile, apart from making
it possible for you to set an
emblem (from your connection)
that becomes associated with
your player account.

"Microphone Test" is a good
option to use, if you're trying
to figure out the volume of the
sound you must produce in order
for the game to correctly
understand it. There's no way to
configure it, at least in this
game, and therefore you may want
to try this option if you're
having trouble with any of the
events that require you to
produce some sort of sound.



3~. Characters (and "Mission"
mode mini-walkthrough)

Next, there is a description of
all characters selectable in
this game, alongside with some
basic information on them and a
mini-walkthrough for their five
missions (and one extra, which
is only available once you beat
the other five), available in
"Mission" mode. Usually, I'll be
following this setup:

(...) All the way up to the last

then:


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? (some
information on when you should
use this
      particular character, for 
  have trouble reading charts)

Also, be aware that the enemies
that you confront in each event
are usually random, and you may
want to get unskilled ones for
events that require proficiency
on a particular area. If you
just can't beat your opponents,
keep on quitting and retrying
this mode until you get some
that are more unskilled than
your current setup. Finally, a
mission will only be available
if you've already unlocked that
particular event, which you can
do by playing the "Circuit" mode
up to its end, unlocking tons of
new events on your way there.
Also, the sixth mission for each
character only becomes available
when you complete the first
five, in no particular order.

4~. Events

Next, you'll be able to read
some information on the many
events that this game has to
offer. Sure, you may read in-
game descriptions of the
controls before actually facing
each event, but those
descriptions aren't always that
good, and I'll also be including
some tips, which are obviously
worth your time. If you're
having trouble with any kind of
event, read its own section and
you'll probably learn all there
is to know about them. All
events are described with easy-
to-understand guidelines,
telling you exactly the steps
that you have to follow in each
event, but be aware that you can
also press "Set Rules", before
facing each event, to change
some of its options - usually,
only the skill level of the COM
opponents is possible to be
changed, but particular events
offer other choices.



4.1~. Athletics

These seven events are, usually,
considered to be some of the
most important ones that the
Olympic Games have to offer.
They've been around for
centuries, and they obviously
play an important role in this
game.



4.1.1~. 100m

The main objective of this event
is being the first one to cross
the finish line, and they're one
of the easiest (and simplest)
events this game has to offer.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When you see the word
   "Ready?" on the upper screen,
   press the lower screen with
   your stylus. A fe that very
   same place, quickly will
   perform a good starting

3. Quickly drag your stylus from
   the left to the right side
   (and vice-versa) of the
   screen. Th character will
   run.

4. When you're reaching the
   finish line, you'll see a "!"
   symbol next to your
   character. If, by then, side
   of the screen, he will m
   amount of time.

As you can now understand, this
is probably one of the simplest
mini-games this product has to
offer. If you get to choose a
character for this event, I
suggest you go for either
"Sonic" or "Shadow", since speed
is all that matters here.



4.1.2~. 400m

One could think that this event
follows the very same controls
as the previous one, but that
just isn't true. Instead,
stamina now applies, meaning
that your characters will run
tired after a while, they can't
just go and dash as much as they
want. However, the basic goal is
still the same, being the first
to cross the finish line.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When you see the word
   "Ready?" on the upper screen,
   press the lower screen with
   your stylus. A fe that very
   same place, quickly will
   perform a good starting

3. After the previous step,
   quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and your
   character will run, but

4. During the race, you should
   be specially careful with the
   bar seen in the upper left
   corner of the speed. If it is
   shown as betw bar, it will
   mean that you're the small
   heart seen next to it, simply
   drag your stylus s yellow
   line.

5. When you're reaching the
   finish line, you'll see a "!"
   symbol next to your
   character. If, by then, side
   of the screen, he will m
   amount of time.

Optimal characters for this
event would be either "Amy" or
"Knuckles", who have good speed
and fair stamina, but going for
"Sonic" or "Shadow" also seems
to work just fine.



4.1.3~. 400m Hurdles

This one follows the general
lines of the "400m" event, but
adds hurdles to the field.
Unlike what happens in other
games of this genre, knocking
these elements down doesn't
increase your finish time, or
significantly slows down your
characters. However, just for
fun (or realism), you may want
to jump above the hurdles, as
you attempt to reach the final
goal of being the first one to
reach the finish line.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When you see the word
   "Ready?" on the upper screen,
   press the lower screen with
   your stylus. A fe that very
   same place, quickly will
   perform a good starting

3. After the previous step,
   quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and your
   character will run, but

4. During the race, you should
   be specially careful with the
   bar seen in the upper left
   corner of the speed. If it is
   shown as betw bar, it will
   mean that you're the small
   heart seen to your simply
   drag your stylus slowe line.

5. When a hurdle is seen next to
   your character, tap stop
   dragging the stylus and give
   a quick tap t your character

6. When you're reaching the
   finish line, you'll see a "!"
   symbol next to your
   character. If, by then, side
   of the screen, he will m
   amount of time.

You can actually manage to beat
this event with characters such
as "Knuckles", who has good
speed and fair stamina, but
"Tails", "Daisy" and "Sonic" are
also good options.



4.1.4~. Long Jump

This one is a classic, an event
which all track and field games
appear to have. Your goal is the
one of jumping farther than all
your opponents, and you have
three attempts to do so.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. Before the actual event, you
   can clap your hands (or give
   small touches in the
   microphone, if you're
   character. I'm not sure if it
   working, but you might as wel

3. Quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and back, until
   you see a "Sp arrow will show

   best possible

4. You may want to time your
   jump, so that you leave the
   floor as close to the line as
   possible, but be
   disqualified. Other factors t
   speed of your initial dash an

You may want to try both "Amy"
or "Dr. Eggman" for this event,
since they appear to be slightly
better at the overall task than
all others.



4.1.5~. Triple Jump

The previous one sounded simple,
right? Well, the Trimple Jump is
almost like performing three of
those smallers jumps in a row,
and they are a lot harder to
time and successfully complete.
As before, your goal is jumping
farther than all your opponents,
and you have three attempts to
do so.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. Before the actual event, you
   can clap your hands (or give
   small touches in the
   microphone, if you're
   character. I'm not sure if it
   working, but you might as wel

3. Quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and back, until
   you see a "Sp

4. A few seconds later, you'll
   see a big arrow. When you're
   next to the line, quickly
   move your stylu for your
   first jump. Once mor for all
   the jumps.

5. Whenever your character
   touches the ground, quickly
   move your stylus, in order to
   perform two other same way as
   before.

6. You may want to time your
   jumps, so that you first
   leave the floor as close to
   the line as possible you'll
   be disqualified. Other result
   are the speed of your three
   jumps.

"Sonic" and "Dr. Eggman" are
some of the best characters for
this particular event, for some
strange reasons.



4.1.6~. Javelin Throw

People sure love to throw stuff
at each other, don't they? Well,
here you will be throwing a
javelin, with your goal being
the one of having this item
achieve the longest possible
distance, outdoing the marks of
your opponents. You have three
attempts to do so.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. Quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and back, until
   you see a "Sp

3. A few seconds later, you'll
   see a big arrow pointing to
   the lower left corner.
   Quickly move your sty
   instantly, another arrow will
   move it in that direction to
   being the optimal value.

4. Both the speed of your dash,
   the angle of the throw and
   the power of your character
   influenciate t

For this event, you may want to
try characters who have a lot of
power, such as "Bowser" or
"Knuckles".



4.1.7~. Hammer Throw

If throwing a javelin just isn't
for you, you can also throw a
strange hammer at the field.
Your goal, as before, is the one
of having this item achieve the
longest possible distance,
outdoing the marks of your other
opponents. As usual, you have
three attempts to do so.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. Draw circles with your
   stylus, as seen with the
   shiny circle, until a
   countdown from three up to on
   let your character give yet a
   which will throw the hammer.

3. When the hammer is in the
   air, a small "!" will be seen
   next to your character. You
   can either scr microphone, as
   doing so appea hammer is
   thrown.

Here, you may want to pick a
powerful character, such as
"Bowser" or "Knuckles".



4.2~. Aquatics

Aquatic sports are fairly new,
and that's easy to understand
when you see the number of
representative they have in this
game - only two modalities,
something which is indeed
limited.



4.2.1~. 100m Freestyle

At first, it may look like
there's not much "freestyle" in
this mini-game, but such feature
was implemented in an
interesting way. Regardless of
this mention, your goal is
simply being the first one to
complete a trip to the other
side of the swimming pool and
back, which is harder than it
sounds.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When all the five characters
   are in the podium, and you
   see the word "Ready?" on the
   upper screen, A few seconds
   later, when "Go sure to
   quickly drag your sty good
   starting dash.

3. When in the water, trace the
   shape seen in the lower

   character. When in order to
   perform a quick d

6. When you're going back to the
   right side of the swimming
   pool, keep on repeating the
   very same shape

Characters such as "Dr. Eggman"
and "Peach" are your best option
here, since they tend to swim
fairly quick and the shape you
must follow for them is really
easy (a circle and a straight
line).



4.2.2~. 10m Platform

Jumping out of a platform held
10 meters above the ground isn't
for everyone, but this game
actually makes it fun. Your
objective is to get more points
than your opponents, in the
three different jumps you have
to perform, with your final
score being the sum of points
that you've achieved in the
total of the three jumps.

1. This event is played by using
   the buttons on the right side
   of the console (A, B, X and
   Y).

2. When your character is on top
   of the platform, hold "A" to
   see a small bar reacting. Try
   to have tha releasing the
   button.

3. A few seconds later, when
   your character is in the air,
   you will see the appearance
   of a certain c as possible,
   but try not to m

4. Shortly after, you'll see a
   small cutscene, which
   generally depicts your
   current character scream that
   happens, he/she will sta the
   chance to press "A". Do s
   down, directly over the verti

5. The last part is specially
   important, since a bad angle
   will heavily hurt your score,
   but all part of points,
   depending on how g

When it comes to picking someone
to face this event, "Tails" and
"Waluigi" are probably your best
choices.



4.3~. Gymnastics

These are events hard to mimic
in a computer game, and so it
ends up being interesting to see
the way they used to transpose
them to a virtual enviroment.
They don't do much justice to
the actual sports, but at least
they're amusing and easy to
perform.



4.3.1~. Trampoline

Jumping on top of a trampoline,
you have to perform as many
combinations as possible. The
ultimate target is getting
enough points to beat all your
opponents, ranging in a scale
between 0 and 10.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When your character starts

   to 30 jumps, but you should
   be aware that the sequences

   even if that do make it
   harder to achieve cer

Strangely, the character you
pick for this event doesn't seem
to be important at all. I've
tried "Tails", "Bowser" and some
others, always with very similar
results.



4.3.2~. Vault

This even is shorter, but yet
harder than its predecessor.
Your goal is simply getting more
points (in a scale from 0 up to
10) than all your opponents, and
you have two attempts to do so,
with the final score being the
average of points which you got
in those two attempts.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. Start by quickly (as quickly
   as possible!) dragging the
   stylus from the left to the
   right side of the Very, very

Once more, the character you
pick for this event doesn't
appear to be important at all. I
tried "Tails", "Vector", "Mario"
and "Bowser" and always managed
to get very similar results.



4.4~. Archery

Archery has been around for
centuries, and just like in real
life you may have to practice a
lot in this game before managing
to get the best results out of
any character. Just like they do
in all those classical "Robin
Hood" films, you can hit the
center of bullseye to get 10
points,
 with the other bigger circles a
goal is getting more points than
all your opponents, during the
12 shooting attempts that you
are allowed to make.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When you start playing, drag
   the stylus down once, to pull
   the string of your bow. Next,
   aim at the stylus to actually

   but as you advance further

Characters with high skill, such
as "Tails" and ones with a lot
of power (as "Bowser") appear to
be good choices for this event.



4.5~. Dream Events

Unlike the other events
available in this game, these
are based on actual Olympic
modalities, or other sports, but
they come with a twist, such as
collectable coins, special
powers, items that damage your
opponents or miraculous jumps.
They're fun, even though they
don't really belong on the real
Olympic Games, and you'll
probably enjoy them.



4.5.1~. Dream Race

Unlike what happens in the
normal races available in this
game, where you just need to
control the speed of your
characters, this one is slightly
different, since you also have
to control their direction and
avoid some obstacles. You and
your opponents can gather
mystery boxes, which contain
important usable items, and your
goal is simply being the first
one to cross the finish line,
after three laps across the
field.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and other buttons.

2. When you see the word
   "Ready?" on the upper screen,
   press the lower screen with
   your stylus. A fe that very

For this one, you may want to
take the fastest possible
character, such as "Sonic" or
"Shadow".



4.5.2~. Dream Canoe

Unlike the Canoeing available in
the actual Olympic Games, this
one is very different from a
simple race. Instead of having
to reach a particular goal in
first place, you have to collect
more coins that all your
opponents, which is easier said
than done.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and other buttons.

2. Quickly drag your stylus up
   and down to increase the
   speed of your own canoe, and
   control your direc "Y").

Since this is an unusual event,
I would suggest you use some
sort of all-around character,
such as "Mario" or "Luigi", to
face it.



4.5.3~. Dream Boxing

I never knew Boxing was actually
played at the Olympic games, but
this game makes it fun. Here,
your goal is hitting your
opponent as hard as you can,
putting him on the floor either
by Knock Out ("KO") or Technical
Knock Out ("TKO"), and to do so
you have to enter a small
tournament where you get to face
two different characters.

1. This event is played by using
   buttons ONLY.

2. Press "A" to give a straight
   punch with your right fist,
   "Y" to give a couple quick
   punches with you increase the
   power of those a strike your
   opponent, with ea kind of
   attack.

3. You can also hold "L" (or
   "R") to protect from physical
   attacks, and dodge opponent's
   punches by p own strikes.

4. Eventually, these actions
   will increase your special
   meter, and once it displays
   (at least) one small your
   special punch. If your o you,
   you can quickly hold "L"
   damage. Also, be aware that
   opponent) have at least one s

   one special left. To counter
   on the screen, which leads to
   "A" as quickly as possible -
   suffers no damage.

5. Each time somebody's health
   drops down to zero, that
   character will fall to the
   ground, and his o a little
   bit. If your charact

   quickly tap "A" to get him up
   lose by KO, but if someone fa
   will lose by TKO.

This is the kind of event you
should take a powerful character
to, someone like "Bowser" or
"Vector".



4.5.4~. Dream Long Jump

Unlike the other events which
require you to jump, this one
puts you to perform a miraculous
jump, followed by a glide in the
middle of the air and landing in
one of the small islands. The
ultimate goal is the one of
landing in an island more
distant than the one of all your
opponents, and even if you have
three attempts to do so, be
aware that landing on the water
(or failing to jump out of the
platform) instantly leads you to
a foul.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and some buttons.

2. Quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and back, until
   you see a "Sp arrow will show
   up - when you quickly move
   your stylus in t jump,
   counting from an horizo

3. Depending on your speed and
   jump angle, you'll fly higher
   or lower in the sky. From
   there on, use t right side,
   such as "A", "B", your
   character's glide. While

   character is getting too
   close to the ocean, you may
   want to land in one of th the
   ocean (which generally ha
   quickly drag the stylus from
   back) to prevent your charact

All-Around characters, such as
"Mario" or "Luigi", are probably
your best choices for this
particular event, but "Yoshi" is
also a good pick.



4.5.5~. Dream Table Tennis

Unlike the normal table tennis,
which is also represented in
this same product, this unusual
version comes with a different
scoring mechanic and allows
characters to unleash special
attacks. The winning condition
is easy to understand, the first
one to reach 50 points wins, and
you'll be playing the event as a
small tournament where you have
to defeat two different
characters to achieve the best
possible position.

1. This event is played by using
   buttons ONLY.

2. Start by tossing the ball,
   which you can do by pressing
   "A" (or either "B" and "Y").
   Next, you can m same keys,
   and when you and y each
   other, each of the contr of
   shot - "A" spins the ball
   correctly timing it, you'll d
   ball left. Also, you can chan
   left (or right) while you are

3. As you return the ball, and
   depending on the shots you
   perform, your special bar
   will increase, ad you have at
   least one golden special
   attack, with its effe playing

4. You can easily see a counter
   increasing its value as you
   and your opponent return the
   ball - wh surpass the
   opponent, he will that
   counter. Be sure to noti to
   counter the effect of the

"Tails" and "Waluigi", due to
their amazing special shot and
high skill, are probably the
best characters you can take for
this event. A special mention
should be given to "Bowser", who
is simply awful at this event.



4.5.6~. Dream Fencing

Fencing is a famous Olympic
sport, which is also represented
in this game, but this version
adds some special moves and a
health bar, instead of relying
on points to determine the
winner. Here, the winner is the
character who first reduces the
opponent's health to zero, and
you'll be playing the event as a
small tournament where you have
to defeat two different
characters to achieve the best
possible position.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and buttons.

2. Use left and right (or "Y"
   and "A") to move your
   character, and you can
   double-tap those keys in orde
   attack, simply slide your sty
   that you can also slide your
   parry the attacks of your opp
   him open for a free attack.

3. When one of your special
   meters is filled, you can
   slide your stylus down in
   order to launch your on who
   you're playing with, a corner
   he may get throw out o also
   delay the attack by not down.

"Dr. Eggman" and "Waluigi", due
to their stats and amazing
special moves, which are even
effective at long range, are
probably your best choices for
this event.



4.5.7~. Dream Shooting

Shooting, yet another event
included in the Olympic Games,
has a slightly different version
here. Instead of statically
hitting targets, you have to
visit three different areas and
shoot everything that crosses
your path, but try to make them
intelligent shots, instead of
mindlessly shooting at
everything. The winner is the
player who has more points in
the end of the event.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and buttons.

2. Move your crosshair by
   dragging your stylus across
   the lower screen, and shoot
   by pressing "L" (or left, and
   even if they are re their
   position, you may want
   bullets in the most important
   shells, you can quickly drag
   of the center of screen, and

3. Unusual enemies are worth
   more points than the robots
   that constantly come to the
   screen, and you s Hitting
   balloons also give yo you to
   steal points from your
   somebody else's. Another way
   combos, which is done by scor
   a single shot.

4. As you progress across the
   three parts of the event,
   you'll see the usual item
   boxes. They always look for
   mushrooms (increase you
   limitless ammo for a shor
   damage to everything in its s
   power of your shots).

Characters with a lot of power,
such as "Bowser" or "Knuckles",
end up being good choices for
this event, but "Tails" also
appears to work just fine.



4.5.8~. Dream Basketball

The actual sport isn't included
in this game, and therefore fans
will have to keep themselves
busy with this smaller version.
Instead of running across the
field and all that, you simply
have throw balls onto baskets,
and the winner will be the
player who has more points when
time runs out, but only those
records achieved when you set
the time to 90 seconds (press
"Set Rules" before the event to
change that) will actually be
saved.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When you see a ball coming in
   your direction, touch it with
   your stylus in order for your
   character t (the lenght of
   your slide con want to throw
   the ball in. If multiple
   baskets, which you c you'll
   get extra points.

3. Once in a while, you may see
   some balls that come with a
   sticker. Those are items, and
   grant you spec the baskets
   bigger for a whil balls), an
   emerald (speeds op which
   makes it impossible for
   basket) and a balloon (aligns
   time). You may also see golde
   points you get from them.

All characters seem to be good
at this sort of event, but
"Tails" and "Yoshi" are actually
better than the average, for
some unknown reason.



4.6~. Table Tennis

If special attacks just aren't
for you, this option allows you
to play the real Table Tennis.
You may have seen something that
resembles this game somewhere
else, but let's pretend you
didn't know that, shall we?
Usually, the winning condition
for this event is that the first
character to reach 5 points
wins, but if they are tied by
then, you'll need to achieve a
two-point difference to win.
Also, you'll be playing the
event as a small tournament,
where you have to defeat two
different characters in order to
achieve the best possible
position.

1. This event is played by using
   buttons ONLY.

2. Start by tossing the ball,
   which you can do by pressing
   "A" (or either "B" and "Y").
   Next, you can m same keys,
   and when you and y each
   other, each of the contr of
   shot - "A" spins the ball
   correctly timing it, you'll d
   ball left. Also, you can chan
   left (or right) while you are

"Tails" and "Waluigi", due to
their high skill, are probably
the best characters you can take
for this event.



4.7~. Fencing

Fans of the classical Fencing
will probably prefer to play
this version of the event, since
it doesn't have any special
moves. Also, it follows the
classical, point-based, idea of
the modality, which requires a
lot more strategy than its
"Dream" version. The first
character to score 10 points is
the winner, and you'll be
playing the event as a small
tournament, where you have to
defeat two different characters
to achieve the best possible
position.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and buttons.

2. Use left and right (or "Y"
   and "A") to move your
   character, and you can
   double-tap those keys in orde
   attack, simply slide your sty
   that you can also slide your
   parry the attacks of your opp
   him open for a free attack.

"Luigi" and "Peach", with a lot
of skill and fair speed, are
probably the best choices for
this event.



4.8~. Shooting

More truthful to the actual
sport than its "Dream" version,
here you just have to try
hitting as many of the flying
targets as possible, and you win
one point for each hit. You
can't reload your weapon, so
you'll have to try hitting each
target with a single bullet. In
the end, the character who has
the most points wins.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. As soon as the event starts,
   call for targets by pressing
   "A", tapping the lower screen
   or simply ye unnecessary, but
   in case you took to do this
   is actually t

3. Move your crosshair by
   dragging your stylus across
   the lower screen, and shoot
   by pressing "L" (or single
   bullet on each target,

4. When your crosshair is on top
   of a target, it will turn
   yellow. When you see that,
   quickly shoot a every target
   across the eight

All-around characters, such as
"Mario" or "Luigi", seem just
fine for this event, but
"Shadow" also works fine.



4.9~. Cycling

Cycling mostly works as a race,
but with a fine twist. The
winning condition is obviously
being the first to cross the
finish line, and you will be
playing the event as a small
tournament, where you have to
defeat two different characters
to achieve the best possible
position.

1. This event is played by using
   buttons ONLY.

2. When you see the word
   "Ready?" on the upper screen,
   hold "L" and "R" to build up
   some power. A few se that
   very same place, quickly take
   off.

3. Alternate between "L" and "R"
   to pedal, just like you would
   do on a real bike. While
   doing so, yo pad to change
   your course. Be quicker you
   will run out of s specially
   careful with the ba upper
   screen, which shows you the
   yellow line and the end o
   stamina, which you can check
   character - in order to regen
   the heart-shaped items placed

4. If you're running below your
   opponent, be aware that you
   can move behind his current
   position t spending any
   stamina.

Picking the best character for
this event depends on how you
decide to take it. You can
either go for a fast character
("Sonic", for example), one who
has plenty of stamina, such as
"Wario", or one who has both
those areas balanced, such as
"Knuckles" - it is really up to
you.
