   _______
  > Stats <
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
There are five basic stats in
this game. They are...

• St - Increases damage done by
  physical and gun-type attacks.
 Note that all of the Main Chara
 those that would otherwise be c
 actually influenced by this sta
power value. Not so for demons.

• Ma - Increases damage from
  demon's magic-type skills and
  increases
 defense to magic attacks. Just 
 main character's attack power d
 You don't want to get one shott
 Also increases max MP by 2 per 
 The main character also gets pa
the Defense value of his armor.
 The last effect of magic is to 
 use a "Stone" type item like Ma
 you probably won't be relying h
 per item and aren't exactly che

• Vi - Increases defense to
  physical and gun attacks. Also
  increases
 HP by 3 per 1 point in Vi. The 
 his damage reduction from the D

• Ag - Largely determines acting
  order in a turn. However, the
  main
 character is a special case whe
 go first when he uses an item o

• Lu - Luck helps determine
  hit/evade rates, probably item
  drop rates.
 It can't hurt to have high Lu.

There is also "Level" as a
statistic in most Megaten
titles, and this game is no
exception. It generally
increases attack
powers/defensive values by a bit
per level, but in this game has
the dubious distinction of also
affecting Hit/Evade rates
heavily making going through the
game at a low level pretty much
impossible.

Stats are assigned randomly with
a percentage chance per stat on
level up, even for the main
character. 3 points total per
level-up, excluding use of some
Sub Apps that can randomly cause
demons to gain more stats if
they are equipped when your
demons level up.


   _____________
  > Resistances <
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Like most Megaten titles since
Nocturne, this game has the
resist system. Basically, you
and every demon you have as well
as every enemy out there have
innate resistances. What they
are determines how effective
each type of element is. These
are displayed in the status
screen.

Wk = Weak. Target takes 150%
damage from attack, or has a
150% normal chance
 to be hit by Expel and Curse sk

-  = No resistance. Target takes
 hit by Expel and Curse skills.

St = Strong. Target takes 50%
damage from attack, or has a 50%
normal chance
 to be hit by Expel and Curse sk

Nu = Null. Attack does not
effect target.

Rf = Reflect. Target reflects
the attack to the attacker.
Unlike most Megaten
 titles, however, Reflect here w
 reflected in Strange Journey, t
 had a "-" in Resistance, regard
 the reflected attack would norm
 reflect or drain the attack nor
 this game's system. Rf is very 

Dr = Drain. Target is instead
healed by the attack.

There are 8 elements that you or
a demon can have a property in
one of the above resistance
types to. They are: Phys, Gun,
Fire, Ice, Elec, Wind, Expel,
and Curse. The 9th type of
attack, Almighty, cannot be
resisted.

A demon's resists can only be
changed by fusing skills which
alter them onto the demon.

The Main Character's resists are
determined by what piece of
armor he has equipped. Each
piece of armor has differing
resist types. He has an innate
Null Expel unless the armor
modifies this, and whatever
piece of armor he wears may add
additional weaknesses,
strengths, or nulls to his
resistance list.

It's a good idea to buy as many
types of armor for him as
possible, and to equip them as
needed for specific fights.


   _____________
  > Demon Co-Op <
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Demon Co-Op is the "gimmick
system" of SMT: Strange Journey.
Nocturne and DDS had the Press
Turn system, Persona 3 and 4 had
the knock down/extra one system
that was sort of based off of
the Press Turn system. Is it
better than Press Turn? I'd say
no.

Strange Journey has this Demon
Co-Op system. So what is Demon
Co-Op?

Well, when you or a demon hit an
enemy's weakness, all other
same-alignment party members
will perform an extra attack
that does Almighty damage.
However, if there are no other
party members of the same
alignment as the attacker who
hit the weakness, no Demon Co-Op
will take place.

Note that Demon Co-Ops only take
place when you hit an enemy
Weakness. It's not like the
press turn and variant systems
where a critical Phys attack
would also work with the system
regardless of whether the enemy
was weak to Phys or not.

The alignment used is the Law-
Neutral-Chaos Axis, not the
Light-Neutral-Dark alignment
axis. You can tell where your
main character or any demon you
have falls into this system by
their name color.

Blue  = Law
White = Neutral
Red   = Chaos

The damage is based upon the
Level, St and Ma stats of the
character and/ or demon(s) who
perform the Co-Op attack and how
many allies participate.

1 ally produces : (ally #1 co-op
damage) x 1.0 2 allies produce :
(ally #1 + ally #2 co-op
damages) x 0.75 3 allies produce
: (ally #1 + ally #2 + ally #3
co-op damages) x 0.7

   ___________
  > Alignment <
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Alignment plays a sort of
important role in this game.

Compared to previous SMT titles
with actual alignment systems,
here...

• Compared to SMT and SMT II,
  you can use all alignments of
  demons, regardless of your
  current ali opposite-alignment
  demons; Law use Law. Here, you
  can use any

• Like other SMT titles with
  actual alignment in them, here
  it helps to determine your
  Ending.

• Is important in determining
  usage of the new Demon Co-Op
  system.

Demon Co-Op attacks are
restricted to same-alignment
character and demons only. You
don't need to have your demons
as the same alignment as your
main character, though. Demons
will still Co-Op with other
demons who are the same
alignment as themselves.

Again, as above in the Co-Op
section explained, the Light-
Neutral-Dark axis of alignment
has nothing to do with Co-Op. It
is the Law-Neutral-Chaos axis
that determines Co-Op. Light-
Neutral-Dark has to do with
negotiation. Dark demons simply
won't talk to you, while most
Light demons don't even show up
in battles to be recruited and
will have to be fused.

It's easier to recruit same
alignment demons through
negotiation, though this hinges
on the Law-Neutral-Chaos axis.

You can easily tell what
alignment your main character or
a demon is by the color of their
name.

Blue is Law.
White is Neutral.
Red is Chaos.

You cannot change a demon's
alignment.

As for affecting your main
character's alignment, read on.

When using the Walkthrough, note
that throughout the walkthrough
there are points where alignment
questions are posed. An
important note is that choices
marked (Neutral) do not actually
move you towards Neutral. They
simply keep you where you
currently are.

If you are Chaos and want to go
Neutral, you must answer with
Law answers until you go
Neutral. If you are Law and wish
to go Neutral, you must answer
with Chaos answers until you go
Neutral. This is "gamey" of
course, but it is what it is.
Why does it work this way?

Think of alignment like a scale,
like so:

   ________Chaos_<______________

Answering Law adds a positive
amount, while answering Chaos is
a negative amount added. Getting
Neutral is a sort of zero-sum
game. If you're wondering how I
got the 17 total point Neutral
scale, well, it's from using the
alignment manipulation trick to
see how many times it took to
answer to go from the very
beginning of Law to Chaos and
then back from Chaos to Law. 18
times. I assume that the
manipulation trick uses the
absolute lowest point value for
responses, while the actual
story question values are
probably much larger. Raidou
Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon
alignment worked similarly,
really.


Which brings me to the next
point, the manipulation trick
itself. It is displayed up in
the Frequently Asked Questions
area of the FAQ, but In the
interest of not making you
scroll up, I'll add it down here
too.


After completing at least one of
the Faerie land establishment EX
Missions and reaching Eridanus
story-progress wise, look for a
goblin just west of the High
Pixie who gives out the Faerie
land EX Missions. Keep trying to
talk to the goblin until you get
dialogue options. You'll get two
sets of options.

(Goblin is digging a hole, but
something seems to be preventing
him from
 digging deeper...)
> What will you do?
• Watch (Neutral)
• Help (Law)

(Goblin seems to have found
something...) "Ooh, lucky me! I
found something!"
• Good for you. (Neutral)
• Hand it over. (Chaos)

By answering Law + Neutral, or
Neutral + Chaos, you can set
your alignment to whatever you
want before your alignment is
finalized in the last dungeon or
to get EX Missions that may
require specific alignment. You
will have to do this many, many
times to see the alignment
change, however, as it is just a
small shift. In fact, if you
wanted to go from just turned
Chaos to just Law or just turned
Law to Chaos, it would take 18
opposite-alignment answers to
shift all the way to the other
alignment.

The chance of the dialogue
options appearing seems to be a
percentage equal to your main
character's Lu stat.

Chance = X% where X = Lu stat
value. In New Game+ / second
cycle, the chance is supposedly
(X+15)%

Battle Parameters
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ First, an
explanation of battle
parameters.

If you press the Y button while
you're at the in-battle menus,
you can bring up a display that
looks a bit like this for each
character in battle:

 _________
| Atk  -- |
| Def  -- |
| Ag   -- |
| Prot -- |
| ___     |
||   |    |
||   |    |
| ¯¯¯     |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
These display battle parameter
changes.

Atk increases or decreases the
target's attack power for all
attacks when it is modified by
spells. Atk is affected
positively by spells like
Tarukaja and Luster Candy.
Negatively by spells like
Tarunda, War Cry and Debilitate.

Def either decreases the damage
taken or increases it when it is
modified by spells. Def is
affected positively by spells
like Rakukaja and Luster Candy.
Negatively by spells like
Rakunda, Acid Breath and
Debilitate.

This "Ag" battle parameter is
really Hit/Evasion chance. Ag is
affected positively by spells
like Sukukaja and Luster Candy.
Negatively by spells like
Sukunda, Fog Breath and
Debilitate. This has nothing to
do with the actual stat, Ag.

Each of these parameters can be
lowered to a minimum of -4, or
increased to a maximum of +4 by
these spells.


Atk will add 12.5% extra damage
done by the character per +1, to
a maximum of 50% added at +4.

Def will decrease the damage
taken by 12.5% per +1, to a
maximum of 50% added at +4.

Ag will increase the chance to
hit and evade from its normal
value 12.5% per +1, to a maximum
of 50% added pe

Conversely, -1 to -4 parameter
changes work the same way. 12.5%
decreases per -1, to a maximum
of 50% at -4.

The "Prot" property simply
displays whether or not the
Tetraja effect is active on a
character. You will see a white
circle if it is. Otherwise --.
Tetraja protects against one
Expel or Curse-based instant
kill before it disappears from
the character.

The box below Prot displays an
icon of a status ailment, if the
target is currently afflicted by
a status ailment.

Take this box as an example:
 _________
| Atk  +3 |
| Def  -1 |
| Ag   +2 |
| Prot () |
| ___     |
||   |    |
||   |    |
| ¯¯¯     |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
In this example, the character
deals 37.5% more damage due to
+3 Atk. The character takes
12.5% more damage due to -1 Def.
The character hits and evades
25% more often due to +2 Ag. The
character is protected by
Tetraja. The character has an
empty status ailment box, and so
is not afflicted by any status
ailment currently.

Status Ailments ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
These are the status ailments in
Shin Megami Tensei: Strange
Journey:


Death ¯¯¯¯¯ Demon's HP reaches
0. It returns to stock and is
dead until resurrected. When
resurrected, the demon will
still need to be resummoned into
the active party unless it is
resurrected in-battle via the
Invitation spell. Obviously does
not go away after battle.

If the main character's HP
reaches 0, it is game over
unless you have the Dragon Ring
equipped which can save you once
per battle like the demon skill
"Enduring Soul" does for demons.


Poison ¯¯¯¯¯¯ HP decreases once
every turn or tile of movement
on the field. This effect does
not go away after battle.


Strain ¯¯¯¯¯¯ MP decreases once
every turn or tile of movement
on the field. This effect does
not go away after battle, but
may disappear after a turn
during battle.


Paralyze ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Target cannot
evade and their defense drops,
making them take more damage.
They will also occasionally lose
their turn. This effect does not
go away after battle.


Sleep ¯¯¯¯¯ Target is asleep and
unable to act. Regenerates a
very tiny amount of HP and MP
per turn while sleeping, and
should they be hit while
sleeping will take much more
damage than they normally would.
A sleeping character also cannot
evade an attack. A sleeping
character is also eligible to be
instantly killed by the Eternal
Rest spell. This effect does
disappear after a battle ends.


Mute ¯¯¯¯ Target cannot use any
spells or skills. This effect
does not go away after battle.


Charm ¯¯¯¯¯ Target loses control
and will attack random allies
using the basic Attack command.
Wears off naturally after
several turns or after battle
ends.


Stone ¯¯¯¯¯ Target is turned to
Stone and cannot act. They will
take less damage but cannot be
healed. If the Main Character
becomes petrified, it is game
over. This effect does not go
away after battle.

Null Curse seems to prevent this
effect on the Main Character,
but as for demons it is up to
the individual demon's ailment
resistance properties. These are
hidden but Zeruel's Fusion
FAQ/demon database has them
documented.


Fear ¯¯¯¯ Target will randomly
lose their turn. A demon
affected by this will randomly
return to stock as well. Wears
off after several turns or when
the battle ends.


Bomb ¯¯¯¯ Target becomes a
living bomb. If struck, the
target has a 50% chance of
exploding, killing them and
dealing damage equal to current
HP to all of their allies. If
the target uses the Defend
command, the chance becomes 0%
while defending. Wears off at
the end of battle.


Rage ¯¯¯¯ Target loses control
and will use the basic Attack
command on random targets which
can include allies--but not
themselves--and will do
increased damage.


   ___________________
  > Demon Negotiation <
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This is a description of the
flow of how demon negotiation
works in this game. With this
info and a bit of experience,
you should be able to use the
system to your advantage.


There's several types of
negotiation. First, I'll go over
the basic type: When you select
Talk in a battle and select an
enemy demon.


• > Basic "Talk" Negotiation
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
To begin, you cannot talk to
demons who are "Dark-" aligned,
except when they initiate the
conversation or it is a full
moon and you use the Lunatic Sub
App. However, these are
distinctly different from
regular negotiation and I'll go
into them later. You also cannot
talk to Enemy Search specific
enemies. Everything else you
meet in a random encounter
however, is fair game. Except of
course, when the Moon phase is a
full moon, but again I will get
to that later as the mechanics
are different.


When you successfully initiate a
conversation with a demon, you
will be given some dialogue
including the note about your
possible alignment differences
and then a choice of 2 or 3
response options.

The alignment note affects two
things...

First, how many items/things the
demon will ask for when you ask
it to be your demon, and how
much Macca it asks for when it
asks for Macca during that facet
of negotiation. Also, how much
HP/MP they drain when they ask
for that. Same alignment demons
ask for less things, less Macca
and drain less of your HP/MP
when they ask for that. Opposite
alignment demons ask for more.
If you are neutral or the demon
you are talking to is neutral,
they will generally ask for a
middling amount.

It also affects the chance of a
demon deciding to not join you
after you've met their demands
when asking them to be your
demon.

Anyway, on to conversation. The
responses that the demon likes
or dislikes are based on...

A) The demon's personality type.
B) The specific-demon itself.

For example, a demon of the Jack
personality type (Fairy Jack
Frost, Fairy Pyro Jack)... will
generally act like this when you
get this 3 response question:

"What's a hee-human doing here,
ho?"
• Adventuring. <- Generally
  likes.
• Research. <- Does not like,
  and will run away.
• A social studies trip. <-
  Generally does not like.

Many demon personalities have
two response questions where
they ask you to come close to
them. The Jack personality one
is...

"Hee-ho! Come closer, ho."
• Get closer.
• Keep your distance.

Generally, for these across ALL
personality types, the "Get
closer" option will be a
positive response, though there
is a small chance they may
attack you (enemy gets free
attack round) and end the
negotiation.

And then there are specific
responses that, within a
personality type, are liked more
by a specific demon and hated by
others. For example again, with
the Jack personality...

"Doesn't that scare you, ho...?"
• It does. <- Generally
  dislikes.
• Not really. <- Generally
  likes.
• Mascots don't scare me. <-
  Jack Frost likes this and will
  force itself into
       your party, but Pyro Jack
       Do I detect jealousy for 

Another example, from the Girly
personality.

"By the way, why'd you talk to
me?"
• I want you to be my demon. <-
  Generally likes.
• I want stuff from you. <-
  Generally dislikes.
• Because you're charming. <-
  Lilim likes this, but Leanan
  Sidhe and Lilith
       for example do not and wi

You need to pass two questions
to get to the negotiation phase.
Generally, across the same
personality type, demons like
the same responses. This takes
some experience on your part to
figure things out. However,
there is a small random chance
that the normal liked answers
anger the demon. All you can do
is suck it up and deal with it.

Once you know the generally
liked responses through trial
and error, you can negotiate
your way to the phase where you
can ask for stuff almost every
time if you're using the Relax
Spray Sub App that allows 1
error.

Anyway, unliked answers; An
unliked answer can result in
three things:

• The demon likes your answer:
  Go to next question or ask
  what you want if one question
  has already passed.
• The demon does not like your
  answer. There are different
  possibilities here:
  • Does not like it, but may fo
    Note that if you have Relax 
    this way doesn't count towar
  • Does not like it. If you hav
    forgive you once per negotia
    negotiation is over. You can
    battle, though if for exampl
    may talk to the other two Ja
    this way, the demon will eit
    battle and dump you back at 
    attack round on you. Negotia
  • Does not like it, and infact
    round. This type of response
  • Does not like it, and is dis
    the Girly personality that y
    you're here for Research. Th
    "disgusted/scared". The batt
    however.
  • After two questions, the dem
    item and then leave, skippin

Battles only end automatically
when a demon joins you or gives
you something.

Normally, after two questions
are answered, you will get these
choices:

> Main Character and the demon
are on friendly terms.
• Try negotiating.
• Stay quiet.

Selecting "Try negotiating"
generally moves you onto the 4
option choice below, while "Stay
quiet" generally makes the demon
do one of two things; Give you
an item or macca, or heal you or
you and your demons and then
leave.

If you select Try negotiating,
the demon rarely may get angry.
Relax Spray can fix this if it's
equipped and not been triggered
yet in this negotiation session.
Usually, things will go fine and
you will get the below choices.

> What will your request be?
• Be my demon.
• I want an item.
• I want Macca.
• I don't want anything.

> Selecting "Be my demon." will
prompt the demon to ask you for
things. It may be to drain your
"vitality/life" (HP) it may be
to drain your spirit (MP), it
may be for curative/restorative
items, it may be for Macca. It
may be a ridiculous request for
hundreds of thousands to
millions of Macca or an Incense,
but your response to that
doesn't matter as it was just a
joke on the demon's part and
even if you say yes it's not
going to make you give it to
them, even if you have it.

Alignment affects how many times
they ask for things and how much
they ask for -- Opposites ask
for more, same alignment asks
for less, and Neutral asks for a
middling amount, always, even if
you too are Neutral. Opposite
alignment will drain more HP/MP
for you and ask for larger sums
of Macca. Same alignments will
take much less than normal.

You may refuse a demon 2-3 times
of a requested thing before they
get angry. Relax Spray Sub App--
if not triggered yet in this
negotiation--can fix this if it
happens. Otherwise, the demon
may forgive you themselves. If
not, the negotiation ends as
normal and the demon may leave
or attack or just end the
conversation telling you to get
back to fighting them.

If you meet the demon's demands
in full, the demon will
either...

... Join your party. If you have
a "Garnish" type Sub App
equipped, they will then give
you whatever that Sub App
prescribes. They are now in your
demon stock. The battle ends. IF
your demon stock is full, the
demon will leave the battle but
will "remember" you. That is, if
you open up a slot in your demon
stock, you can simply talk to
that demon next time you meet
them in a random battle and
they'll join you automatically,
once.

... Decide to not join your
party. Chances are higher for
opposite alignment demons. If
you have the Tea Amity Sub App
equipped, they will reconsider
and join your party 100% of the
time when this happens, and if
you have a Garnish Sub App
equipped, will again give you
whatever that Sub App is
supposed to make them give you.
If the demon does not join you,
it will leave the battle and the
battle does not end if there are
still more demons in battle. If
the demon joins you via Tea
Amity of course, the battle's
over.

> Selecting "I want an item."
causes the demon to give you an
item.
  The battle then ends, with the

  No questions asked, no strings
  The "Extra Item" Sub App cause
  you get an item from a demon i
  just choosing to give you an i

> Selecting "I want Macca."
causes the demon to give you
some Macca.
  Higher level demons give more

  No questions asked, no strings
  The "Extra Macca" Sub App caus
  when a demon chooses to give y
  them just choosing to give you


> Selecting "I don't want
anything." has random results.
The demon may simply
  call you a weirdo and leave ba
  item. They may give you Macca.

... and that about covers the
basic negotiation as initiated
by the player with the in-battle
Talk command.


• > Full Moon Negotiation
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now I'll go over Full Moon
negotiation. During the Full
Moon phase, you cannot talk to
any demon unless you have the
Lunatic Sub App equipped.
However, if you equip this Sub
App and talk to them...

You will enter a nonstandard
negotiation with the demon where
they ask you a question with two
responses.

The chance of each response
getting a positive effect is
about equal, really. When liked,
the demon will give you an item
or Macca and then leave, or may
join you. It's random.

When unliked, the demon will
leave the battle, cancel the
negotiation, or get a free
attack round.

That's really all there is to
Full Moon negotiation. The only
upside to it is that it lets you
talk to Dark- aligned demons.


Now, there are two types of
"Initiated by demon"
negotiations. They are:


• > Demon initiates: Beginning
  of battle...
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The "Green Grass" Sub App
increases the chances of this
happening.

You can...

• Ask them to be your demon.
• Ignore them.

If you "Ask them to be your
demon" there is a high chance
that they will join you and the
battle will end. However, they
may call you a fool and attack
you. It's a bad idea to ask them
to be your demon if your HP is
low when this happens,
obviously. Note that if you have
the Green Grass Sub App
equipped, the chance of them
faking you out is 0% -- they
will in other words always join
you. Useful. If a demon joins
you, the battle will
automatically end.

If you ignore them, the result
is the same. They'll either tell
you that you're dense for not
knowing that they wanted to join
you or they'll act surprised you
"saw through their trap." What
happens however is the same, the
demon leaves the battle and the
battle does not end if there are
still more demons left.

• > Demon initiates: Mid-combat,
  afraid of you...
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The "Light in Hell" Sub App
increases the chances of this
happening.

You can...

• Let it go.
• Stop it from going.

If you "Let it go" it will do
one of three things. One, it
will simply say thanks and
leave. You get nothing. Two, it
will say thanks, give you an
item and leave. Three, it will
say thanks and join you.

If you Stop it from going, it
will give you an item and then
leave, or it may attack you.
Though only demons who are left
by themselves will choose to beg
for their lives so there isn't
much threat in stopping them
unless your HP is low, or
something.

That's pretty much all there is
to negotiation.


Being successful with demon
negotiation is just a matter of
learning the patterns of
acceptable responses within
personality types and of course
using Sub Apps such as Relax
Spray, Tea Amity, Green Grass,
and Light in Hell to your
advantage. It's less complex
than in other titles such as
Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King
Abaddon, but it's less random as
well.


There's also a small matter of
gifts for when you successfully
talk to demons of certain
personality types a set number
of times. Successfully talking
meaning, getting past the first
2 questions you're asked and to
what would normally get you to
the negotiation stage.

The number of successful talks
does not reset when you start a
New Game+, but when talking to a
new personality for the first
time in a New Game+, you get the
message that says it's "your
first time hearing a demon that
speaks like this" which makes it
seem like it does.

  > Compendium Password System <
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

In Shin Megami Tensei: Strange
Journey, players can use and
create passwords for custom
demons using the compendium
functions associated with
passwords.

How does it work? When you use
the "Output password" function
in the View Compendium section,
the game will spit out a
password. If you're writing
these down, make sure to look
carefully at the password as to
not confuse any somewhat similar
looking characters such as o, O
and 0.

Players can use passwords by
using Compendium -> Register
function and scrolling to the
bottom and using one of the
three password slots. There are
only three slots, but if all are
full you can overwrite whichever
one you want by just registering
over it.

Selecting Register in a password
slot brings up a small keypad
which you can use to input the
password. Passwords are of
course case sensitive, so make
sure you enter them correctly.
You can enter them using the
Stylus if you wish, and pressing
the X button is a shortcut to
changes the current character
set from upper to lower case and
back. If a password is entered
in full correctly, you will see
the demon's data and be asked to
confirm the registration. If
not, you will get an invalid
password error.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

   __________
  > Main App <
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Main App is the functionality of
the Demonica that is always
activated once you acquire each
specific function.


Proximity Alert ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Basically, a random encounter
meter. It goes from blue, to
yellow, to red. You begin with
this and it has no upgrades.


Forma Search ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Allows
you to find Forma out on the
field. There are three ranks of
this App. Rank A displays Red
Forma. Rank B displays Silver
Forma, and Rank C displays Gold
Forma. Each has differering
contents. Forma Search A and B
are gained as required story
progress objectives.

Forma Search C is optional and
comes from a Rare Forma which is
a reward from the EX Mission
"Catch the rabbit!"


Unlock ¯¯¯¯¯¯ Unlocks the locked
door portals you may come
across. Different ranks unlock
different colored doors.

There are five ranks. Unlock A,
Unlock B, Unlock C, Unlock D,
and Unlock E. Unlock E is
optional and comes from a Rare
Forma found in Grus 1F, original
space. You need Gate Search E to
get at it-- it's in the
northwest part of the map.


Gate Search ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Allows
you to open secret door portals.
There are five ranks of this, as
well. Gate Search A through E.
Gate Search E is optional and
comes from a Rare Forma from the
EX Mission "Marebito, the
foreign god."


Enemy Search ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Like
Forma search, except for
enemies. With this, you can find
tougher enemies and enemies that
can't be found elsewhere. They
usually drop nice items in
addition to unique forma, though
most do not give experience
points.

Many demons found via Enemy
Search are restricted fusions
that cannot be made until you
defeat them in battle. However,
extremely tough enemies known as
Fiends may show up rarely...

There are three ranks of this
Main App, A through C. Enemy
Search A and B are gained as
required to progress through the
story, while Enemy Search C is
optional and found in the
southeast corner of B4F in
Horologium.


Phase Shifter ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Shifts you over to a different
dimension in a small pocket
area. This can only be done at
the special space manipulation
devices, and is needed to
progress in various parts of the
game after it becomes available.

There are two ranks, each
bringing you to different areas.
Both ranks of this are found as
required to progress the story.


Visualizer ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Visualizes
dark areas, giving you a rough
3D visual on the geometry of the
area, essentially allowing you
to see in the dark. However, you
still cannot see the map tiles
fill in. This just allows you to
navigate.

There are three ranks of this
App, each of which will
visualize a different type of
dark area. They're all
technically "optional" though it
is difficult to traverse certain
areas without them.

A lights up the Blue areas, B
lights up the Red, and C lights
up the Yellow.

Rank A is found via Rare Forma
in the east part of 4F
Delphinus. Rank B is found via
Rare Forma in the northeast part
of 1F Jack's Squad HQ. Rank C is
found in B6F of Horologium, in
the southwest area of the map.

  > Sub Apps <
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Sub Apps are non-critical Apps
that give a wide variety of
possible effects. Each has a
"size" assigned to it and you
can use a max of 10 units of
size worth of Sub Apps at any
given time. You can change
equipped Sub Apps at the Lab on
the Red Sprite or at any
terminal. The 10 units of size
will never increase, so choose
carefully. They're rather minor
bonuses though, for the most
part.

A NOTE ABOUT THIS WALKTHROUGH:

I'm not going to tell you what
demons to use. This is entirely
up to you. I generally just tell
you what skills you should be
using when it comes to the boss
fights.

I DO provide pre-made password
demons for all difficult boss
fights, however note that these
passwords are provided as-is and
will probably be expensive as
all good password demons are.
They are custom-made to kill the
bosses, generally, though many
of them have a somewhat
versatile skillset that can also
be used to crawl the dungeons.

They are there for those who get
stuck and really have no clue
how to fuse or don't have proper
sources and just want to move
on, but you still have to earn
the money to buy them and be the
proper level.

¯¯¯ Select to begin the game and
watch your scenes, and you'll
eventually be prompted to enter
your character's name. Do so.

The choice after naming yourself
to shake Commander Gore's hand
affects alignment. Your very
first alignment choice, in fact.

> Commander Gore held out his
right hand... What will you do?
• Shake his hand. (Neutral)
• Refuse to shake. (Chaos)

After the scenes you'll be
dumped into the menus in the
ship. You can talk to other
crewmembers if you'd like or
save your game.

If you talk to Zelenin in the
command room here, you can get
yet another alignment-affecting
choice.

> Extend your hand to Zelenin?
• Yes (Law)
• No (Chaos)

What you'll need to do is select
"Move" from the menu and select
to go to the Deck area of the
ship, then select Yes to go to
Commander Gore's briefing.

You'll enter another lengthly
scene where you meet a notable
crewman, Jimenez, and learn
about the DEMONICA - DEMOuntable
Next Integrated Capability
Armor. Yeah, that's a mouthful
and doesn't make perfect sense--
but whatevs--and you will be
given a sort of questionnaire
that will determine your initial
statistics and your stat-growth
type.

¯¯¯
• Question #1

"You are the sole survivor on a
battlefield. You are hidden,

 • 2: It's impossible.
 • 3: I don't know.

 Again, the game will just ask t
 for this question.

¯¯¯ Depending on your answers,
your DEMONICA"s stat-growth type
and your initial stats are now
set. Only questions 1-5 actually
matter, obviously, since Q6 is a
classic "... But thou must!"
moment.


Strength-type
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
"Attack support"

Answer Questions 1-5 with the
first choice.

Percent chance growth rates
are...

St: 24%
Ma: 18%
Vi: 19%
Ag: 20%
Lu: 19%

Initial stats: 56HP, 32MP, 7 St,
5 Ma, 5 Vi, 6 Ag, 5 Lu, 22
MeleeAtk, 15 GunAtk, 21 Def


Magic-type
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
"Technical support"

Answer Questions 1-5 in this
order: 3, 1, 3, 2, 1.

Percent chance growth rates
are...

St: 19%
Ma: 24%
Vi: 19%
Ag: 20%
Lu: 18%

Initial stats: 58HP, 37MP, 5 St,
7 Ma, 6 Vi, 5 Ag, 5 Lu, 20
MeleeAtk, 13 GunAtk, 22 Def


Vitality-type
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
"Physical support"

Answer Questions 1-5 in this
order: 2, 1, 1, 2, 2.

Percent chance growth rates
are...

St: 18%
Ma: 19%
Vi: 24%
Ag: 19%
Lu: 20%

Initial stats: 63HP, 32 MP, 5
St, 5 Ma, 7 Vi, 5 Ag, 6 Lu, 20
MeleeAtk, 13 GunAtk, 23 Def


Agility-type
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
"Speed support"

Answer Questions 1-5 with the
third choice.

Percent chance growth rates
are...

St: 19%
Ma: 20%
Vi: 18%
Ag: 24%
Lu: 19%

Initial stats: 55 HP, 35 MP, 5
St, 6 Ma, 5 Vi, 7 Ag, 5 Lu, 20
MeleeAtk, 13 GunAtk, 21 Def


Luck-type
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
"Luck support"

Answer Questions 1-5 with the
second choice.

Percent chance growth rates
are...

St: 19%
Ma: 19%
Vi: 19%
Ag: 19%
Lu: 24%

Initial stats: 60HP, 36 MP, 6
St, 6 Ma, 6 Vi, 6 Ag, 7 Lu, 21
MeleeAtk, 14 GunAtk, 22 Def


All in all, it doesn't really
matter what you choose. This is
a pretty minor choice, to be
honest. The level-up stat-ups
are random and the chance for
stats to be distributed in any
given stat is of course a
percentage-based chance based on
the growth types. There are
other choice combinations that
result in the above growth types
as well, but those are ones I've
confirmed to work.

I chose the Luck-type, because,
well, I like more frequent item
drops, and it is pretty balanced
in distribution chances with
Luck being the highest. Of
course, this could just be me
being superstitious. Who knows!
Anyway, even as Luck
specialization I didn't end up
with Lu as my highest stat, to
show how random it is.

You'll be sent documents you can
review on your DEMONICA.

• Document: Schwarzwelt
  Investigation Team
• Document: Mission Log
• Document: Alignment
• Document: Demonica

Read them if you wish--you'll be
in the ship navigation menu
again. Talk to Jimenez and the
crewmembers if you wish as well.
Talking to Jimenez gets you yet
another alignment-affecting
choice.

> Offer Jimenez a handshake?
• Yes (Law)
• No (Chaos)

Afterwards, select move and go
to the Command Room to progress
the story once again. Talk to
everyone there, then move to the
Deck once again.

More scenes, leading to the four
ships entering the Schwarzwelt.
A question will be asked by a
crewmember during one of these
scenes, and it affects
alignment:

"Feeling relaxed, are we?"
• I've been trained. (Neutral)
• Deep down, I'm praying. (Law)
• I'm not afraid to die. (Chaos)

In the following scenes, a
mission will be added to the
log, as well as a document about
the Misson Log.

• Document: Mission Log
• Mission: Engineering SOS

Read them if you wish, and talk
to the crewmember at the Command
Room if you wish as well. You
can save, too. After you're
done, Move to the Deck. More
scenes will commence and you'll
receive the Demon Summoning
Program, and be sent into battle
automatically with unknown
enemies.

Simply use your Gun's regular
Gunshot attack a few times to
win the battle, since it hits
all enemies. Note that when you
meet any new regular enemy, they
will always display as unknown
like in this battle. The
"Engineering SOS" Mission is
complete after the battle. After
this, more scenes and a new
Mission added.

• Mission: Sickbay Trouble
• Document: Demon Summoning
  Program

When you regain control, your
next objective is to head to the
Sickbay part of the ship. Go to
the Lab first, though, and
Crewman Chen will give you
[Medicine x5]. Plus a new
document. Heal yourself up and
head to Sickbay.

• Document: Demonica Display

Another battle takes place here,
with yet more Slimes. Gun them
down the same way you did the
last time. Your DEMONICA should
level up here. The statistics
are automatically assigned,
unlike previous SMT games where
you had a choice of where to
distribute them. The Sickbay
Trouble mission is now
concluded, as well. A new
document is added, too.

• Document: Demon Analyze /
  Unknown Demons

Yet more scenes! And another
main Mission added.

• Mission: Missing Crewmen

When you've gained control
again, it's time to actually
begin exploring the Schwarzwelt.
You can now use the Sickbay to
be healed, and go to the Lab to
restock on items-- Crewman Chen
will give you [Medicine x10]
right now.

Head to the Deck to begin the
next part of the game. You can
now choose to enter Antlia, the
first sector of the Schwarzwelt
available to you. Do so by
selecting "Disembark" here at
the Deck and then select Antlia.

- Antlia 1F

A new Document will be added.
It'll tell you the controls to
navigating in the 3D dungeon
field.

• Document: Field Controls

Most directions I give in this
Walkthrough are based on Compass
directions. North - East - South
- West. Learn them if you don't
know them. Seriously.

Head north to meet a Strike Team
member who will give you some
more info on basic knowledge you
need to play the game, then head
north through the door to
automatically enter a battle.

Here, in this battle, the Pixie
will teach you about Demon
Negotiation. This isn't like a
real negotiation, she's just a
friendly demon teaching you the
ropes. Ask her to be your demon
when the choice appears. She'll
tell you about the kinds of
things demons will ask for in
negotiations. She'll also tell
you about how alignment affects
negotiations. Finally, she'll
tell you about negotiation with
unknown demons.

She'll ask if she can be your
demon, so there's no reason to
not accept her. Fairy Pixie will
join you. Make sure to go into
your DEMONICA menu and add her
to the active party. She'll send
you a document about all of
this, too. Make sure to recruit
all of the demons you can from
now on. You'll need them.

• Document: Demon Conversation
• Document: Summoning Demons

Make sure to summon her in Party
-> Summon before you continue.
You'll have someone to heal you
and do some extra damage. Quite
useful!

Now you can begin exploring the
dungeon. To the west of your
immediate location is a treasure
box with [Chakra Drop x1]. Back
east and then south of the door
you entered this area from, you
will find Crewman Irving at the
dead end and he'll head back to
the ship's Lab.

West and north of the entrance
door in the main part of this
area at the door you will
automatically enter a battle
where Demon Co-Op attacks are
explained. After you win, you
get a new document.

• Document: Demon Co-Op

Head west through the door
beyond where that battle was
fought and you'll meet a Strike
Team member who'll send you more
info about Demon Analysis. Go
west from there and meet a
Crewman. Choose to save them,
and win the easy random battle.
It's Crewman MacCleary and he'll
send you a document about moon
phases.

• Document: Moon Phases

In the north end of this room is
a treasure box with [Revival
Bead x1]. Grab it and head back
into the main entrance room,
then take the door in the north
end of the room. In this area,
you find another crewman,
Muccino.

Navigate west, then south in the
hallway to the dead end, and
turn west to open up a treasure
box with [500 Macca]. Now head
back into the main part of the
room and to the east side and
find a small path heading south
to some ice boulders and another
crew member, Maebe. Choose to
save her from the demons, and
win the battle. The Missing
Crewmen mission will now be
completed.

Head out of the dungeon via the
way you came in to get back to
the ship, as Commander Gore
asked. You can't do anything
else here anyway as the odd
doors with the markings on them
can't be unlocked as of yet.

A new mission will be added
inside the ship:

• Mission: Rescue Jimenez

If you talk to Kato on the deck,
he'll give you an alignment
altering question...

"Should I stop him?"
• Rules are rules. (Law)
• There are exceptions. (Chaos)

Save your game and head over to
the Sickbay to heal up. Then go
to the Lab if you need more
Medicines. It'll cost you now,
though. Next, head back out into
Antlia via the Deck. In Antlia,
you'll meet Commander Gore who's
now part of the Strike Team.
He'll mark a spot on your map.

To get to it, we'll need to do
some navigation. Head on over to
where you saved Crewman Maebe at
the ice boulder wall. Commander
Gore and the Strike Team will
blow it up, revealing more area
to explore. After the scene,
head south and then at the first
fork, go all the way east to
reach a door with an emblem on
it. It is a terminal. Enter it.
You can save your game here, or
teleport out of the dungeon.
Useful.

North of the terminal is nothing
but dead ends for now, so you'll
need to head south of it and
take the south-east path. At the
southmost point here you will
find a Heal Spot, at which you
can pay Macca to heal your
party. It costs the same amount
as the Red Sprite's Sickbay it
seems.

East of the Heal Spot's location
is the spot that Commander Gore
marked on the map. Before you go
in, however, you may want to be
level 5-6 with a full party of
4. Fire spells are a plus. A
party with Pixie, Knocker, and
Tangata Manu as your demons will
suffice. In fact, I believe all
of the other demons you can
encounter up until now are Dark
aligned and thus you'd have to
be a pretty lucky skunk to have
any of them in your party. Once
you've got your party assembled
and ready, go save your game at
the terminal and then head to
the door right before the
marking on the map. Of course,
make sure to use the Heal Spot
on the way there. Enter the
door.

Scene where Gore gets his ass
kicked later, and it's time for
the first boss of this Strange
Journey, Orias of the Fallen
clan.
   ____________________
  < Boss: Fallen Orias >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 250 / MP: 130 ]
  > Wk: Fire / Nu: Expel, Curse 

This is a very straightforward
battle. All Orias can do is
attack you, and although he hits
fairly hard, you will be able to
outheal any damage he can do to
the Main Character with items or
the Pixie's Dia spell.

Your main source of damage
should be the Fire Shot gun
attack from your Main Character
and the Pixie's Agi spell, both
of which will trigger Demon Co-
Op attacks from all Neutral
aligned characters in your
party. That being all but
Tangata Manu, who is Law
aligned.

Knocker and Tangata Manu can
just use normal attacks or
Tangata's Needle Rush skill. It
doesn't matter much though since
neither will really contribute
much damage. Simply slug it out
with Orias and heal via
Medicines with the MC or Dia
from Pixie when needed.

If you're level 5-6, this'll be
cake and over in no time.

¯¯¯ You'll get [Lemegetonite]
after the battle, and the Rescue
Jimenez mission has now been
completed. Your Lemegetonite
will automatically be taken for
Crewman Irving to analyze during
the scenes. You'll also get an
alignment question from Jimenez.

"Tell me, what's it gonna be?"
• I'm sticking it out. (Law)
• I'm out of here. (Chaos)

A new Mission will be added,
issued by Arthur.

• Mission: Engine Restoration

After the scene, talk to the
various members in the areas of
the ship if you wish and heal
up. Blair on the Deck can tell
you more in-depth info about
Demon Co-Op. Then head into
Antlia once again.

Make your way to the save
terminal near where you fought
Orias, and from it head north
and follow the path east to come
to where the wrecked ship was.
Basically it is on the other
side of the ship from where the
Orias battle took place. It's
the wrecked Blue Jet ship. A
scene will take place here if
you choose to search.

In the scene you'll get the
Tokamak Motor and CU Terminal.
Once again, head back to the
base ship, the Red Sprite. The
Engine Restoration mission is
now complete.

When you regain control, head
into the ship's Lab. Your
DEMONICA will be upgraded with
the Forma Search A ability.
Documents will be sent to you
about this all, as well, and a
new main Mission.

• Document: Forma Basics
• Document: Main App
• Document: Forma Search
• Mission: Collect Rare Forma

Forma is basically materials
used to make new things.

Talk to Crewman Chen to learn
more about the whole deal. Next,
save your game, heal up and head
back into Antlia once more.

Upon entering, you'll meet a
generic Strike Team member and
get more info about the Forma
Search function you'll need to
use for this mission. Review any
materials and then continue on.

There are two ways to get the
Forma. Killing or negotiation
with demons, or by picking them
up on the Field with Forma
Search. All you can do is
explore areas you've already
been to and look for Forma.
That's the basic mission right
now. Their locations are random,
so just walk around the floor
and pickup what you can. You'll
want to find Forma until you
stumble upon a rare one named
[Feather Flock]. Irving will
then request you bring it to
him.

Back at the Red Sprite, head
into the Lab. The mission
Collect Rare Forma is now
completed. Irving will give you
the [Unlock A] App. You can now
unlock some of the doors with
emblems in the dungeon. You'll
get a document about Sub Apps
and be called to the Command
Room by Arthur.

• Document: Sub Apps
• Document: Unlock

A scene will play and you'll get
a new mission. The Demon Fusion
function is now available, as
well. And a question from
Jimenez about what you think
about demon fusion.

"Think you'll have fun with
fusion?"
• Yeah, I can't wait to start.
  (Chaos)
• I'll use it if I need to.
  (Neutral)
• You should be careful. (Law)

• Mission: Energy Signature
  Investigation
• Document: Demon Fusion
  Fundamentals

Visit the Lab for possible new
items from your collected Forma,
including equipment and Sub
Apps. The following Sub Apps
will now be available:

Hyakutaro, Hiroemon, Lunatic,
Relax Spray.

If on a New Game+, these will
also be available:

Red Carpet, Frost Icon, 7-Card
Hand, New MegaTen.

Save your game and do your basic
maintenance stuff then head back
into Antlia.

The Unlock A app will let you
unlock the doors with the green
markings on them.

Take the path west from the
entrance room and unlock the
door in the southwest part of
the floor, and head through it.
This is a fairly linear path
that leads to a dead end with
[Agilao Stone x1] in a treasure
box in a large room. Head back
now.

Take the door in the northwest.
Not the northmost door as that
has a yellow symbol and can't be
unlocked yet. It's just a loop
around to a one-way door to an
area you've already been, but
you might find Forma here.

From the terminal near Orias,
which you should save at and
note that you can now change Sub
Apps at a terminal, head north
and unlock the door there.

It leads to stairs down to the
second floor.

- Antlia B1F

A new floor, with new demons.
Head west and at the fork you'll
hit an event. A Fairy will
request you give her a Bead
since she's all beaten up.
Accepting will open up an EX
Mission.

• EX Mission: The little injured
  faerie

From now on I'm going to
simplify directions excepting
the case of things like teleport
mazes, dark areas or other
things that are just not easy to
navigate.

The south path at the fork leads
to a door. Go through. There's a
Heal Spot in the northwest part
of this room, a terminal in the
northeast, and a bunch of locked
doors scattered all over. Behind
each of the doors, the
appearance of the dungeon
changes and stronger enemies are
found. Proceed with caution.

Take the eastern door to begin.
It's a linear pathway which you
may find some Forma in, but
nothing of note. Back at the big
room, take the south path. You
can find a Strike Team member on
this path who will send you a
document. North side of this
area has a treasure box with
[Revival Bead x1]. The east-
most part has stairs down, so
work your way west. You can meet
another Strike Team member there
who will tell you more about
fusion and the compendium
function.

• Document: Raising Demons /
  Demon Sources
• Document: Demon Compendium
• Document: Using Demon Sources

Oh, and another terminal just
beyond him. In the west end is
more stairs heading down, so
just explore the rest of this
area. You'll find a treasure box
with [Chakra Drop x2] and
probably more random field
Forma. Get back to the entry
room with the Heal Spot and
explore the west now.

You'll find a treasure box with
[Patra Stone x2] in this area,
and otherwise this is a dead end
area. You now have two choices
on how to proceed... Down the
stairs in the southeast or
southwest parts of the floor.

I'd recommend the southeast for
now.

- Antlia B2F

The East end is literally a dead
end in which you can find a dead
Strike Team member and maybe a
random Forma. Head back up to
B1F and take the western side
stairs down this time.

You'll immediately be presented
with a fork, doors east and west
in this new area. Take the west
for now. You can find a Sandman
demon here which will give an EX
Mission.

• EX Mission: Sandman's backup
  bag

Now go back and take the east
doore You'll run into a fixed
battle with a Brute Oni. Nothing
you can't handle. He does
mention a Master Morax, however.
After you win, a Strike Team
member shows up and gives you
some random Forma, [DF Antlite
x1] and [Jaki Bolt x2].

Continue on to reach a fixed
battle with a Fallen Melchom and
Brute Oni.

No swag for winning this time,
but you can continue on past
them into the door. South of
there you'll find a treasure box
with [Bufula Stone x1]. Another
fixed battle awaits further in,
versus Brute Oni with Beast Kaso
and two Fairy Pixies. Continue
on afterwards.

You'll reach an area where a
powerful demon is detected. A
Strike Team member will send you
a document with a demon
password. Make use of the Heal
Spot in this room, and the
Terminal. Save. Unfortunately,
the Strike Team member's demon
is utterly worthless. Try the
one I listed below if you need a
healer for your team.

I recommend you explore the
outlying areas to find [1000
Macca], and [Revival Bead x2] in
treasure boxes. Fuse up and/or
recruit some demons that are
around your main character's
level for the upcoming boss,
which is just obviously beyond
the northern door.

Ideal equipment is the Andersen
gun and Ancient Vest, if you've
got the forma for it.

Here are some password demons
for the boss, if you're having
trouble.

¯¯¯ Beyond the door is the next

He'll ask you a question before
the battle.

"Aren't demons the real heroes?"

• Not at all. (Neutral)

Then you will have to fight.
    ____________________
   < Boss: Tyrant Morax >
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   [ HP: 700 / MP: 9999 ]
   > Wk: Ice / St: Gun / Nu: Exp

Morax uses Maragi often, so you
may wish to de-equip the piece
of armor that gives the Main
Char a weakness to Fire as
that's just going to end up
causing you much pain. Other
than his Maragi, he uses a spell
called Gehenna which can cause
the Fear status effect to any
member of your party. Fear can
cause a loss of a
character/demon's turn or make a
demon return to the stock and
need to be re-summoned.

He can also use some semi-
powerful phys strikes "Lunge" a
single target Phys, and Horned
Rampage, a random target,
possible multiple hitting
Phys... but these aren't much of
a threat compared to the former
abilities. If you're having
trouble, summon up the password
demon above and use its Sukukaja
to help your evasion/hit rates.
Jack it up to +4 since early
bosses including Morax don't
know Dekaja. The password demon
can also heal. Having another
demon with Media could help, as
well, but probably unneeded.

You could use Ice attacks if
you've got a same-alignment team
for offense, but chances are you
don't and if you do they don't
have ice attacks unless you've
been doing way too many fusions
up until now. He's not very
difficult, anyway. I just used
non-fire elemental attacks and
my regular attacks from the main
character while using Cursed
Lance sword that hits twice.
Morax only has 700 HP.

Just be around level 10-11 with
level 8-11 demons and recent
equipment and it will not be a
problem to win this fight so
long as you don't go in as Weak
to Fire or something stupid like
that.

¯¯¯
• Tyrant Morax fusion is
  unlocked.

You'll also get the [Brass Horn]
key item and [Energy Mass] key
items. You'll automatically
return to the Red Sprite
afterwards. The main mission
Energy Signature Investigation
is now complete.

- Bootes 1F

Look out for the red floors when
proceeding, they will damage
your party when you step on
them, so avoid stepping on them
except when you need to in order
to proceed. Southeast of the
entrance you can find and talk
to a friendly demon Melchom who
will offer you an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Melchom's task I

Explore the open areas and note
the "portals" at some dead ends
where you can examine walls that
you can't open. In the southeast
you can meet a Karasu Tengu who
has an EX Mission for you as
well, to find Koppa Tengu. Go
ahead, do him a solid if you're
bored.

• EX Mission: Long nose in the
  air

In the same general area of that
Karasu Tengu you'll be able to
meet three demons named Dis on
the field. If you talk to all of
them they'll give you a new EX
Mission if you accept. You don't
have to go to where they want
now, but you can't die from this
even if you do. You'll even get
a free accessory and a full heal
for your party for accepting
this and it opens up an EX
Mission later on in the game.

• EX Mission: The madness of
  Yggdrasil

In the southwest area you'll
find a generic Strike Team
member who'll tell you about the
Records menu and send you a
document about them.

• Document: Records

North of that location, you can
launch a Signal Beacon that
Arthur gave you earlier.

Now in the northeastern end of
this floor you can find a
terminal and the second launch
spot for a Signal Beacon.

The main mission Bootes Monitor
Duty is now completed, and
Arthur requests that you return
to the ship. Before you do, make
sure you fully explore the areas
available and get the rare Forma
[Release Jewel]. It's found in a
small room in the very northeast
end, north on the map of where
you launched the second Signal
Beacon. Return to the ship to
continue the story.

A new mission will be added in
the ship.

• Mission: Emergency Signal
  Inquiry

Head on over to the Lab to give
Irving the Release Jewel, which
will add the new App [Gate
Search A] to your DEMONICA. This
one lets you go through some of
the gate portals at the dead
ends inside Bootes. The ones you
cannot access are of course for
different gate search types.

• Document: Gate Search

Save your game and do your usual
ship stuff then head back into
Bootes. You'll note when
exploring that Crewman Norris is
acting weirdly. The portals are
basically another type of door.
When you run into Norris in the
central part of the floor, a new
main mission will be added, as
well.

• Mission: Search for Norris

Directly north of where you met
him is a portal which leads to
the "Palace" area he was talking
about. It's of course another
area which the appearance and
enemy lineup changes. The other
portals in the area you can open
are just shortcuts and empty
rooms. Map out the one in the
southwest though as an EX
Mission takes place there and
it's good to have map knowledge
in that EX Mission.

You'll now want to explore the
palace area. It's full of damage
floors so try to take the paths
that have the small 1 tile
damage floors to pass rather
than 3 to 5 in a row. The
northwest part of the floor has
a heal spot while directly north
of where the Terminal is you can
find some stairs going up and an
inoperable elevator.

The Heal Spot should help you
map past all of those damage
floors. Once you have explored
all you can, the only way to go
is up those stairs.

- Bootes 2F

With your first step north
you'll reach something you can
examine, something on the floor
which says "Take the long road."
What does it mean? Well, there's
pitfalls on this floor.
Annoying, yeah. It means you
should take the longest paths to
get to your destinations.

The direct south path is a
pitfall, southwest a dead end,
and the southeast will lead to a
terminal and the way forward.
Next, take the east path going
north, as the west one is
shorter and a pitfall. After the
two doors ahead, you'll find a
treasure box with [Dis-Charm x4]
in it. The next fork in the
road, take the east to get a box
with [Revival Bead x2] and then
take the north path which leads
west to stairs up, and go up the
stairs.

- Bootes 3F

Another floor, different demons,
etc. First order of business is
to go around the west path here.
The center one is a pitfall
leading to 1F which means you
have to backtrack, and the east
one has damage floors. Going
through the door on the other
side will have you teleported to
4F during a scene.

In the center of this room is a
human, one of the DEMONICA
wearing investigation team
members from another ship. Talk
to her. It's Zelenin. The main
mission Emergency Signal Inquiry
will be completed. The northeast
part of this room has a portal
you can unlock to reveal a door.
Go through. You'll be sent back.
After that, examine the north
wall one tile west of that door.
Now talk to Zelenin again.
Another scene, and you'll be
teleported to 8F. Now you'll be
forced to go through the door in
the north as the demon next to
the stairs won't let you pass.

Inside, a scene with Mitra, the
demon leader round these parts.
During the scene, you'll be
given the [Luxury Bell] and
transported back to your ship.
The question responses don't
seem to modify alignment. A new
main mission will be added
during the scene on the ship.

• Mission: Rescue Zelenin

Re-enter Bootes. After the
scene, head back into the
palace. Inside the palace go to
3F once more. You'll now be able
to pass the point where you were
teleported away before. East of
that door is a box with [Muscle
Drink x1]. Grab it and continue
on this linear path, reaching a
box with [Bead Chain x1] before
you keep on the path, leading to
the stairs up to 4F.

- Bootes 4F

There's a terminal in plain view
almost immediately after you get
onto this floor. Use it to save.
Continue down the path to reach
a scene where you talk to
Zelenin from the other side of
the door to the room she's in.

A demon will show up and drop
you in the room adjacent to
where Zelenin is held. Simply
examine the human corpses in all
corners of the room, then go to
the center. During the scene,
Norris will be experimented on
by the demons and you will have
to fight him.

You'll get a choice before the
battle...

> What will you do?
• Go and save him. (Neutral)
• Keep watching. (Chaos)

If you try to save him, you'll
take damage before the fight
begins.
   ___________________
  < Boss: Foul Norris >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 650 / MP: 293 ]
  > Nu: Expel, Curse <

Very easy fight. His first name
definitely isn't Chuck. If you
have some demons with skills
like War Cry it'll make it even
easier. Norris has the Stun Claw
ability which can inflict the
Paralyze status ailment which
will reduce your character's
effectiveness, and he has
several multiple/hit all
physical skills.

Just pound away on him and heal
when you need to. He may blow
himself up at low HP, causing a
small amount of damage to the
entire party. Just make sure
your main character's HP never
gets too low.

¯¯¯ After the fight, the main
mission Search for Norris has
been completed. Head through the
south door to Zelenin's cell and
then explore Zelenin's cell to
trigger another scene and meet a
major character, Mastema. Search
the rest of Zelenin's cell and
Mastema will create a pit in the
northwest corner. Use it to drop
down to 3F, and then follow the
path on 3F to reach a pit to 2F.
From 2F, you can move a tile to
drop down to 1F where you'll
meet Mastema again. Now after
the scene, heal up at the nearby
Heal Spot and leave the dungeon
back to the Red Sprite. Mastema
will give you the rare Forma
[Chiasto Mirror] before you go.

On your way out you'll have to
fight a boss, Macabre.
   ______________________
  < Boss: Spirit Macabre >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 800 / MP: 360 ]
  > Nu: Expel, Curse <

He'll pretty much only attack
with Physicals, but he can use
one named Blight which can cause
the Poison status ailment. If
you have any decent demon that
knows Posumudi, you should use
it. Otherwise, if you have
demons with buffs/debuffs, make
sure to use them as well.

The only major danger in this
fight is really having your
entire team poisoned, so having
Dis-Poisons and/or Posumudi
casters is really a must here
since poison damage can and will
do as much damage as you can
heal per turn with Media.

¯¯¯ When you win, get back to
the Red Sprite via the terminal
or walking or however you like
to get around.

In the ship, you'll get another
story scene. The main mission
Rescue Zelenin will now be
complete and you'll get a new
function for your DEMONICA,
[Enemy Search A] plus a new
mission.

• Document: Enemy Search
• Mission: Bootes Rosetta

Enemy Search allows you to find
hidden enemies which are enemies
you can't normally meet. They're
generally tougher and worth more
Macca, and drop nice or rare
items and Forma you can't get
elsewhere.

Back in Bootes, head up to 4F.
At 4F, save at the terminal and
head down the hall to meet the
previously invisible demon
that's been messing with you
ever since you arrived in this
sector of the Schwarzwelt.

It's a Night Fomorian. Walk up
and inspect the Enemy Search
reading without going past it
begin the battle with it. It's
weak to Wind, and is pretty easy
to kill. Past the door beyond
where that battle took place,
you'll have two choices, west or
east. West leads to a pitfall,
while east leads to a switch on
the wall which activates the
elevator, and stairs down to 3F.

It leads to a small area. If you
inspect the north wall on the
east side, you can find a hidden
portal you can open and go
through, leading to a larger
area full of damage floors. In
the southwest of this area is a
pit leading down to 2F, where
you can find a box with [Sleep
Harpe x1] and a way back to
previously explored areas of 2F.

By the way, if you talk to the
Hariti demon near the damage
floors in the damage floor room
during the Full Moon, she offers
an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: That unforgettable
  taste...

Back on 3F in the room with the
damage floors, the north end has
some stairs going up to 4F once
again. On this part of 4F, avoid
the east path and follow the
west path until you reach a
fork, south of which is stairs
up. Just head north to fall down
and mark up some more of 4F and
then drop down to 3F damage
floor room. Maybe you'll get
some forma.

To continue, get to the elevator
and ride it up to 4F. Preferably
go heal up on 1F first. In this
area of 4F, continue along until
you activate an event with
Jimenez. Jimenez will take out a
Fallen Bifrons in an automatic
battle you watch, then you'll
meet Bugaboo who becomes
Jimenez's demon.

> What will you do?
• Talk to him. (Chaos)
• Finish him off. (Law)
• Leave. (Neutral)

You can find stairs up to 5F
beyond where this event began.

- Bootes 5F

Explore what you can and then
head up the stairs in the
southeast.

- Bootes 6F

There's a terminal at the first
west. In the northwest, there is
a Strike Team member that will
give you [Chakra Drop x3]. Head
up the easily visible stairs
afterwards.

- Bootes 7F

On 7F here, there's a Heal Spot
to the east of where you enter
the floor. Explore what is
readily apparent though there is
a pitfall in the South central
area which will cause a bit of
backtracking. From the second
door upon entering this floor,
go west in a hall until you hit
a wall and you'll find a portal
to clear for a door. Go through
it and search the south part to
find a switch on a wall to fix
another elevator, this one on
the part of 5F you can reach via
the elevator.

Afterwards, go north and loop
around to find a way down to
another part of 6F.

- Bootes 6F

[Dis-Strain x4] in a box can be
found in the northwest part of
this area, and a terminal in the
west. You can find stairs down
to a small part of 5F which
contains [Ma Incense x1] in a
box. Back on 6F, you can access
the elevator you just fixed.
From that elevator, go up to 7F.

- Bootes 7F

Near the dead end in the north,
look for a portal on the west
wall to open up a door. Through
that door you can find a
terminal and stairs up. The
stairs up lead to where the next
boss is, so if you'd like to
explore / level up more, go back
to the elevator and take it up
to 8F.

A demon, Halphas, on this floor,
will offer an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: A sport for
  gentlemen.

This rewards the UMA's Ball key
item.

Low 20s with similar-level
demons should be good enough for
the next boss. Don't be weak to
Ice, either. Green Vest and
Alabaster gun are ideal
equipment for your main
character.

Here are my password demons for
this upcoming boss.

when ready.

   ____________________
  < Boss: Tyrant Mitra >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 1200 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Wind / St: Gun / Nu: Ice

He has around 1200 HP and can
use Mabufudyne (Ice) and some
Phys-type attacks, as well.
Explosive Fist -- a medium
single target, and Rampage, a
random target that can hit
multiple times. Yes, he uses
Mabufudyne, which is a top-tier
ice damage spell. Nobody better
be weak to Ice or they're just
going to die.

Aside from this, he has two
special attacks.

Waking Dream, which causes some
damage to all and a sometimes
causes Strain status that'll
cause the target to lose a small
amount of MP each round.

Light of Order which is NOT
Expel or Curse based, and has a
100% chance of effect-- it will
never, never miss either. It
kills a demon.

If you have anything you can use
to lower his attack such as War
Cry debuff or Tarunda, go for
that. Debuffs are better than
buffs here due to the possible
insta-kills on your demons. Just
revive any demon who dies with a
Revival Bead and resummon them.
He cannot remove buffs or
debuffs at all, so push them to
+4/-4 if you're using them.

If you've debuffed his attack,
you can easily heal with just
Media.

He's not very difficult, but do
try to go on the offensive early
so you won't run out of MP on
your healers due to Waking
Dream's status effect. You might
also try putting a demon that
reflects Ice in your party such
as Jack Frost, but Jack Frost
may be a little too low-level
and weak and may get destroyed
by Mitra's physicals.

¯¯¯
• Tyrant Mitra fusion is
  unlocked.

You'll get the [Stone Fragment]
key item for victory, and the
item [Rosetta: Boo]. You will
then be automatically returned
to the ship. The main mission
will be concluded.

During the scene, you'll travel
to the third sector, Carina.

- Carina 1F

[Knockout Gas x3] can be found a
bit northeast of the entrance,
and [Muscle Drink x1] in one of
the corridors south of there.
Far in the northeast is a Heal
Spot and an elevator you can
take to 4F. South of those,
through a door, you will meet
Mastema again. There's an
alignment choice associated with
this meeting.

"Do you recognize me now as
different from those demons?"
• I trust you. (Law)
• You do seem different.
  (Neutral)
• I can't just yet. (Chaos)

Head south from this location
and you will find stairs up and
then stairs down right next to
them. Go down. You'll be in B1F.

- Carina B1F

A short scene plays where Arthur
announces he's found the missing
ship. He'll mark your map, and
Jimenez will comment that he's
in the area but that there's
"dark areas he can't see in".
Dark areas! Joy.

Once you step through that first
door, you will be in your very
first darkened area. You must
rely on the sounds that you make
on impacting with walls to guide
you.

In this dark area, head north as
far you can, east as far as you
can, 3 tiles north, then go west
and enter the door. Grab the box
with [Bead x2] in the north end
of this hall then go back into
the dark area. Head east as far
as you can, then north as far
you can, then west, then north,
then east two tiles.

Consider this a small
intersection, north then east
will lead to a small room where
you may find a Forma or
something. Back at the
intersection, go east two tiles
to reach a door. Inside here,
you can find a terminal to your
east.

From the terminal, go south into
the dark area, and west as far
as you can then south as far as
you can and through the door.
Here, you'll find a Friendly
Jack Frost with an EX Mission.
Be a bro and help fulfill a dark
hee-ro's destiny here when you
can. It's worth it.

• EX Mission: The snowman's
  revenge

Beyond the Jack Frost, a box
with [Mental Drink x2]. Head
back to the terminal area, and
from the dark room's entrance
from the terminal, go west one
tile then south as far as you
can and enter the door. From
here, just take the south door
to reach the map marking.

A scene plays here, and it seems
a demon sort of "fused" with the
Elve ship. "Horkos" who looks
suspiciously like a series
demon, Orcus. You can't do
anything yet, so leave this
floor and go visit Mastema on
1F. A new mission will be added
when you accept his request.

• Mission: Mastema's Request

You need to get a Wilder and a
Megami demon to Mastema for this
next part.

The Strike Team member near
Carina's entrance literally both
tells you how to fuse their
clans AND gives you passwords
for them, they are...
___

  Megami Hathor        Wilder Ju
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Nymph and Angel      Beast and
  harem                tangle

¯¯¯ Yes, those are ACTUAL
passwords. Don't forget the
spaces.

They'll summon up the lowest
level Megami and Wilder demons.

When you have a Wilder and a
Megami demon in your stock,
return to Mastema. Hand the
demons over and he'll transform
them into the [Shibboleth]. Take
the Shibboleth to the Lab on the
Red Sprite. You will get the
[Horkos Buster] key item.

Take it into Carina and go to
where Jimenez and Horkos are.
Choose to fire it at Horkos, and
after the scenes go up to 1F
where Mastema previously was.
Horkos is there now. Fire it
once again. You'll get [Chakra
Pot x1], [Sacrifice x1], and
[Findite]--a rare Forma. Horkos
gets away again though.

Take that Forma to the Lab on
the Red Sprite. Your DEMONICA
will now have its unlock ability
upgraded to [Unlock B].

With unlock B, you can revisit
Antlia and Bootes to do some
stuff. Do it if you want or just
skip down to the part where
Carina carries on.

- Antlia

After getting the Unlock B
upgrade in the Carina sector,
you can unlock the door in the
north part of 1F here.

If you did EX Mission "The
injured little fairy" earlier,
you can find a High Pixie here
who will give an EX Mission line
to you, starting with...

• EX Mission: Faerie land
  establishment I

There are also other colored
locked doors but you cannot open
them yet.

- Bootes

After getting Unlock B, you can
unlock the yellow doors. [Bead
x1] and [1500 Macca] behind a
door in northeast 1F, outside
the palace. In southeast 1F, you
can meet Dionysus, who will give
you an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Death distilled

In the southwest part of 1F
where I said it was good to map
out earlier, you can now meet up
with Strike Team members for an
EX Mission. However, you will
have to fight a Fiend if you do
this. He is stronger than the
area boss of Bootes and has
instant death curse spells as
well as a fear status spell.
He's weak to Elec, but if you go
back there like halfway through
Carina he shouldn't be much
harder than a regular hidden
enemy in the Carina sector.

• EX Mission: Escape plan

To complete this mission, take
the following route: Right,
Left, Back, Right.

You will then have to fight
Fiend David. You get [Death
Omen] as a reward. It'll make a
Sub App Fiend Converter for you
to fuse Fiends with back at the
Lab when you take it back there.

[Summon Stone x1] is behind a
door on 4F's east side. 5F's
east side has [Sacrifice x1].
5F's west side has [Bead Chain],
and [Ag Incense x1].

- Carina

Back in Carina, you can and
should now explore the other
floors and behind some of the
yellow taped doors you can now
open. [Soma Drop x1], [Revival
Bead x2], [3200 Macca] can be
found behind the 1F east door,
as well as a terminal and some
stairs up. 4F via the south
stairs in 1F gets you [Amrita
Soda x2]. 4F via elevator just
has a terminal and a gate portal
that can't be used for now.

Go up the stairs to 2F in east
1F.

- Carina 2F

At first it may seem you can't
do anything on this floor
either, but west of the heal
spot, on the south wall, look
for a portal. You can go through
there once you reveal it. Horkos
will be in the small room
beyond.

Fire the Buster at him again to
get [Bead Chain x1], [Vi Incense
x1]. Horkos will flee again,
this time to a room just east of
there that you can already
access. Fire it once again at
Horkos and you'll see scenes
that end with you getting the
[Graviton Radio], and taking it
back to the Red Sprite.

More scenes will play, including
one in which you're introduced
to yet another important
character, Louisa Ferre. I'm
sure you know who this is. A new
mission will be added in the
scenes after.

• Mission: Carina's Rosetta

The new mission is to go stick
that pig. Get into Carina again.
Follow Horkos up the stairs to
2F and near that unworking
teleporter. He'll flee and drop
[Swine's Hoof]. Take it back to
the ship's Lab.

A new function is added to the
DEMONICA, [Phase Shift A].

• Document: Phase Shifter

It should be obvious what this
lets you do. It lets you use the
space manipulation device that
Horkos fled through. Use it and
shift over with shift A. This
also opens up a part of 2F via
the south stairs in 1F. You can
get [Lu Incense x1] and [Tetraja
Stone x2] there. And if you
shift back over in the area,
[Chainsaw x1] plus a direct link
to the areas you'd be exploring
anyway.

You can find [Mental Drink x1]
and stairs up in this area. East
of the stairs is a secret portal
door you can follow to find
[Soma x1]. Go up afterwards.

- Carina 3F

When you reach the dark rooms,
take the middle door, go south 4
tiles, then then west, then 2
and open south. Grab the [St
Incense x1] from the box. Go
back into the dark. East 2, then
south 3, east 1 and open.
Explore here, then back into the
dark room the way you came in.
Go west 1, south 3 and open
east. Ahead is a terminal and
you'll catch a glimpse of the
trail of Horkos. Continue on. At
the dead end search to find a
portal.

Go through. At the fork, the
west path hides a hidden portal
leading to a space manipulator,
while south leads to [Chakra
Drop x3]. Get the loot then
shift over.

Explore to find [Bead x2], and
in east you'll find stairs and a
door to a dark area. In the dark
area. Go south 1, east 1, south
1, enter door south. Go west all
the way, then north all the way
and open west. Explore this
phase-shift area and you will
find stairs up, [Summon Stone
x1], and a terminal.

Up the northeast stairs before
the dark area is nothing. Up the
newly discovered stairs past the
dark area, Horkos' location will
now be marked on the map.
There's a terminal and a clear
path to him. Of course, you'll
probably want to heal up first,
which you can do by going
through the phase shifted area
of 3F and then using the
convenient stairways down to 1F.

Ideal equipment for Horkos is a
physical resistant armor such as
Recycle Vest and a gun that has
either Elec or Fire if you're
using Co-Ops, or a gun that has
Arm Shot if you're not going to
use a team of same aligned for
Co-Ops. "Blaster" has both Arm
Shot and a Fire attack. If
you're going to use the Recycle
Vest, make sure you remove it
after this boss battle because
it is weak to all four primary
magic elements, and that's just
not cool.

Here are my password demons for
this upcoming boss.

¯¯¯ When ready, go into the door
to fight Horkos.

He'll ask you a question before
battle.

"How will you deal with such
excess?"
• We'll learn to control it
  (Law)
• We need those products.
  (Neutral)
• Humans can destroy, too.
  (Chaos)
   _____________________
  < Boss: Tyrant Horkos >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 1800 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Fire, Elec / St: Phys, G

Horkos heals himself by half the
damage he inflicts with one of
his weaker physicals "Taking a
Bite". It'd be a good idea to
debuff his attack, but to no
more than -3 or he will use
Dekunda and just remove it. Same
goes for buffs: No more than +3.
Tarukaja, War Cry, Arm Shot,
Rakukaja, Rakunda, etc, are
great spells for this fight, but
again don't do more than +3 or
-3 or he'll use Dekaja or
Dekunda and remove them.

He'll ocassionally summon up a
Beast Katakirauwa via skill
"Grocery Run" and eat it a few
turns later via "Binge Eating",
healing himself for half of the
Katakirauwa's remaining HP. Make
sure to target it with anyone
who can't do significant damage
to Horkos as to lower the amount
of HP he'll gain if/when he does
eat it. Some status ailments
will even transfer to him should
he eat a Katakirauwa afflicted
by them, including Charm.

The Katakirauwa has 280 HP, for
reference, while Horkos himself
has 1800.

For an easy time with keeping up
with any possible HP gain on
Horkos' part, have multiple fire
or elec casters of the same
alignment abuse his weakness for
Co-Ops. I personally had 2 Chaos
and 1 Neutral demon, plus was
neutral myself and only had 1
fire caster. This again isn't a
very difficult battle, and
there's multiple ways to go
about winning it.

I've included teams of same-
aligned demons that should
pretty much destroy him after
the original writing of this,
anyway. Use them if needed.

¯¯¯
• Tyrant Horkos fusion is
  unlocked.

You'll get the [Stomach Acid]
and [Rosetta: Car] key items,
then will automatically return
to the ship. The main mission
Carina's Rosetta is now
complete.

Move to the sickbay to begin.
Another main mission is added.

• Mission: Inquiry into
  Commander Gore's Body

Next, to the Lab. Many new Sub
Apps are available for you to
buy, thanks to Horkos' Stomach
Acid rare Forma. They are:

HP Recover II, MP Recover I,
Nurse, Zealot Summons, Friend
Item, Friend Macca, Friend Heal.

On the deck, Dent offers a
couple new EX missions.

• EX Mission: Killing time II
• EX Mission: The enchanting
  spirit

"The enchanting spirit" is the
start of a line of EX Missions
that is easy and quite worth the
effort in terms of rewards.

- Delphinus 1F

Time to explore a new sector.
[Bead x2] can be found east of
the entrance, [Tetraja Stone x1]
in the northeast, [Life Stone
x5] in the northwest, and [Dis-
Stone x2] in the southwest.

Stairs to 2F are directly ahead
of the entrance.

- Delphinus 2F

Move forward a couple steps and
Zelenin will comm you for help.
You'll get a map marking. Ahead
of you is a terminal, so save
and then head on over. Or make
the motions to. This floor has
conveyor-belt like contraptions.
Luckily when you step on them,
their directions become marked.

[Poison Gas x1], [Bead Chain
x1], [Chakra Drop x2] can be
found via taking the conveyors
to places throughout the floor.
The first room with a treasure
box accessible from conveyors
also happens to have a corpse in
it for the Black box retrieval I
EX Mission.

To get to Zelenin, take the east
conveyor to begin, then
southwest, then west, the center
one going west, and go through
the north door and search for a
portal to the east, and go
through. Ride the conveyor then
follow the path, ignoring the
stairs up and the conveyors
along the way. You'll come to a
terminal, and beyond the
terminal, Zelenin is just past a
door.

You'll have to fight 2 somewhat
stronger Haunt Ghoul and Wilder
Nue for her. But no big deal,
really. Head up to the third
floor afterwards.

- Delphinus 3F

Just choose a direction to head
in while Zelenin heads in the
other here. You won't be able to
progress further because Jimenez
is blocking the way. Go into the
proper room and Zelenin will
comm you again. Meet Zelenin
over at the stairs down
afterwards. She will give you a
rare Forma [Passage Jewel].
You'll return to the Red Sprite
immediately following the
scenes. A new main mission is
added.

• Mission: Treatment Development

Take the Forma you were given by
Zelenin to Irving in the Lab.
Your gate search ability is
upgraded to [Gate Search B],
allowing you to open up higher
level gate portals than before.

The main mission now calls to go
back to previously visited
sectors. In this case, to
Bootes.

- Bootes

Mastema will show up once you
enter, and ask you an alignment
altering question during the
scene.

"How to handle such power...?"
• You just have to be careful.
  (Law)
• I use it only when I have to.
  (Neutral)
• None of your business. (Chaos)

Melchom here in Bootes has a new
EX Mission as well.

• EX Mission: Melchom's task II

There's hidden portals in the
northwest and northeast part of
1F. NE side has [St Incense x1],
[Ma Incense x1] and a door
leading into the the palace, but
it's a dead end. NW side has [Ag
Incense x1], [Vi Incense x1] and
a door leading into the palace,
but also a dead end.

Go in the palace via the normal
entrance and take the elevators
up to 8F, then search for a
portal in the north hallways.
You can find [3000 Macca], [Bead
Chain x3], [Soma Drop x1], and a
door leading to an event.
Another scene with Zelenin and
Mastema, and you get [Madman's
Stone]. Return to the Red Sprite
with it, then take it to the
Lab. Take the resulting [MK Gun]
to the sickbay.

The main mission Treatment
Development is complete. A new
mission is added.

• Mission: Delphinus Parasite
  Treatment

Dent can offer a new EX Mission
if you completed "The enchanting
spirit." In fact, you can ride
those missions now until the 6th
that Anthony will offer via
Dent.

• EX Mission: To see her
  again...

Do what you need, then go into
Delphinus.

- Delphinus

You need to go around using the
MK Gun on the Strike Team
members you find out here. One
is in the southwest of 1F, he'll
give you [Demonica Code] for
saving him. It's a key item, and
in puzzle form. The password can
be input as it is (the "x" are
actually multiplication symbols)
or you can do the math and get
another password:

2000

It summons a level 39 Vile
Mishaguji with Mediarama,
Mazionga, Acid Breath. Better
than the one inputting the key
item's passcode as-is gives you.
You're probably too low of a
level to summon it right now,
but maybe later.

After you're done with that
business, to the east and west
of the stairs to 2F you can find
portals that you can now open.
Beyond the west, [Revival Bead
x2] and you can talk to a demon,
Kudlak. He'll offer an EX
Mission.

• EX Mission: Find a sickle
  called Pest Crop

Behind the east portal, you can
find a demon named Kresnik who
offers you another EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Hawthorn Spear
  needed

When you're done reviewing
those, go up to 2F.

- Delphinus 2F

On 2F, you can cure a Strike
Team member by taking the first
conveyor east from the entrance.
He'll give you [Soma Drop x1].
North of the stairs you enter
from you can also find a portal
which opens a shortcut to 3F
stairs.

Note that if you do not save
these guys before you save
Jimenez, they are later gone and
you can't get their free items.

Head up to 3F and proceed to
where Jimenez was before. He's
still there. Shoot him with the
MK Gun.

You'll return to the Red Sprite
for scenes and the Delphinus
Parasite Treatment mission is
concluded.

Back in Delphinus, head up to 2F
and you'll get a reading in an
easily accessible room. You'll
get into a battle with two
Spirit Formless. They have about
500 HP a piece and can cast
status ailment spells. Nothing
to worry about. Take them out.
After the scenes, go on up to
3F.

- Delphinus 3F

A scene will play here where the
main mission Inquiry into
Commander Gore's Body is
completed. During the scene....

"Won't you end man's rule on
Earth?"
• I will. (Chaos)
• I can't let that happen.
  (Neutral)

If you answer "I will"...

"Then why don't you cease this
invasion of the Schwarzwelt?"
• All right. (Chaos)
• I can't. (Law)

After the scene, go eliminate
the map markings-- More Spirit
Formless. Explore the floor
afterwards. [5500 Macca] can be
had in the southeast part behind
a gate portal, as can [Dis-Para
x4]. The stairs up are in the
same area as well. In the west,
[Chakra Drop x4]. You can meet a
Strike Team member named McClane
here who will give an EX
Mission.

• EX Mission: The shadow
  withdraws

You can find stairs up beyond
here. Explore 4F via the stairs
you've revealed thus far,
starting with the eastern
stairs.

- Delphinus 4F

First thing you'll come across
is a demon that tells you about
a treasure that may let you see
in the dark, and then a dark
room. Go west, then south, then
east, then south to get out of
this one.

You'll find a rare Forma,
[Kaisetsu Stone] in this room,
and a terminal. If you enter the
south door, you'll be in another
dark room. Go east 1, south 2,
west 3, south 2, east 1, south
2, west 1 and exit south. Grab
the [Sacrifice x1] from the box
here and trip the pitfall in the
southwest corner. Head straight
west and grab [Amrita Shower x1]
from the box, then search along
the north wall for a door
leading into the dark area.
Careful not to step on the
conveyor.

In the dark area, go straight
west and exit into a room. Grab
the [Kamudo Sword x1] and go
back into the dark room. Back in
the dark room, go all the way
east, then north, then east and
exit north. You can find stairs
up here, but more importantly in
the north end of this area you
can unlock a gate portal which
is a shortcut to the beginning
of 3F.

Go back to the Red Sprite's Lab.
Irving will make a new Main App
enhancement for the DEMONICA.
Now I don't have to give you
long-winded directions for dark
rooms since you'll sort of be
able to see in them now with
[Visualizer A].

• Document: Visualizer

Now that you can see in dark
areas, go up to 3F and take the
west stairs up to 4F. As you can
see upon entering the dark area,
it's not so dark anymore. The
only thing you miss out on is of
course that the only thing
displayed on your map is your
current location and no actual
coverage takes place.

You can find the Strike Team
members for McClane's EX Mission
in the north end of this area.
After this, head up to 4F via
the staircase you can access via
the shortcut opened earlier
while acquiring the Kaisetsu
Stone.

There's a terminal in plain view
if you need it. Heal Spot, too.
The stone statue to the north
looks interesting, doesn't it?
It should if you know your SMT,
as you already know who it is.
However, for now you can do
nothing with it. Go through the
dark areas to either side of it,
and go up to 5F via the stairs.

- Delphinus 5F

More dark areas almost
immediately. Great thing for
that App, huh? This floor has
not only dark areas but
conveyors in the dark. Enter
from the far east, and while in
the first corridor heading west,
take the third conveyor to your
left. Avoid the conveyors and
look for the door. Continue to
the terminal, and west past the
terminal into the dark area.

After the conveyor ride, head
west then north onto the next
conveyor. Then take the next
path north onto a conveyor. Then
go east and south onto the
conveyor. When it stops, go east
then ride the conveyor north.
Enter the door visible to east.
You can now find the way up to
6F.

- Delphinus 6F

Use the terminal. Now you have
to ride some more conveyors and
deal with switches to reverse
their directions. Thankfully,
the new direction is displayed
on revealed conveyors.

Ride the westmost one and flip
the switch, then ride it back
down. Now ride the one first one
just to east of the one you got
off of, and navigate to the
stairs without stepping on any
conveyors, avoiding a south
turn.

If you mess this up, the
conveyors don't reset when you
come back to the floor so you'll
need to get to the eastmost
conveyor switch and then work
your way back to the beginning
of this floor.

Go up the stairs when you reach
them.

- Delphinus 7F

More conveyor hijinks. To begin,
go north, west, then ride the
south conveyor. Then the west.
Flip the switch and ride the two
conveyors you rode here back to
the entrance to the floor. Now
ride the one east of it, go 1
south, two east, 2 south, and
ride east then south.

Flip the switch, then ride the
first one you just rode back,
then take the north one. You can
now enter a room with one of the
readings. More Spirit Formless
to fight. Take them out.

Now repeat the process of
hitting both conveyor switches,
and when you hit the second
switch this time, move in the
following order...

From the switch, northeast
conveyor, west conveyor. Now
ride the ones to your southwest,
the west of which works when the
switch is pressed this way. Ride
the westmost one, then when it
stops turn west and ride that
one. Enter the door to fight two
more Spirit Formless. You'll
have to fall down the pit to 6F
after their defeat.

Make your way back up to 7F. On
7F, hit the first switch, then
from there ride only the very
first conveyor back, then go
south and you'll be able to find
the stairs from there if you
avoid further conveyor contact.

- Delphinus 8F

Avoid opening any doors here
until you find the Terminal.
Save up. Now, any of the doors
here on this floor (including
the hidden portals right near
the stairs you came in) may have
Spirit Formless in them, if the
Formless spirit didn't already
announce it'd show you its true
form. If it has already
announced this, go down to 4F.

- Delphinus 4F

Big surprise. The room the
statue was in is now marked for
a Rosetta reading. Save and heal
here. Enter the room when ready.

Make sure you don't have armor
that is weak to fire equipped.
Preferably, equip one that is
strong to fire. Boss uses
Maragidyne.

Equipping the Rock Vest made
from Delphinus materials is a
good idea, and if you're using
same alignment demons then a gun
which has some Ice spells such
as the Frost Cannon from the
Jack Frost EX Mission in Carina.

As usual, here's a roster of
demons that will get you
through, should you have
problems with the boss with your
own demons.

  [ HP: 2000 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Ice / St: Gun / Nu: Expe

Asura reflects Fire and Wind
attacks, so those are out. He is
weak to Ice.

For the first round, make sure
to guard with everyone.
Otherwise, you have a high
chance of being afflicted by the
Rage status from the Asura Roga
attack he will always launch on
the first round. An ally under
rage status will attack random
targets including allies and
does much more damage. This is
mostly bad because you can end
up killing allies.

He'll regularly use Maragidyne
afterwards, which is why you
need the protection against
fire. He can also use a random
hit fire spell which isn't
nearly as powerful, Concentrate,
and Ashura, a powerful random
physical attack that can hit
multiple times. At low HP, he
might also use "Black Flame", a
fire spell which hits random
targets and has high power like
Maragidyne.

I cast Bufudyne with my Black
Frost, debuffed his attack to -3
(War Cry and Arm Shot) and
healed with a demon that knows
Mediarama as needed.

This isn't an easy fight due to
the Rage status. He'll reuse
Asura Roga every 5-6 turns, so
be ready to defend. How many and
who get afflicted by the effect
can make or break this fight.

I've also heard some people have
had some luck just going it solo
with the MC attacking with a
sword under the rage status and
healing themself with stocked up
Beads when they weren't raged,
but this is very risky and
probably not going to work so
well unless you're pretty
overleveled since the Ashura
phys attack may kill you.

Of course, after the original
writing of this walkthrough I
have included teams of demons
that will absolutely destroy
him. It'll cost, though.

¯¯¯
• Tyrant Asura fusion is
  unlocked.

You'll get key items [Ulna] and
[Rosetta: Del]. You will
automatically go back to the Red
Sprite and more story scenes
will play out. Zelenin presents
a question that can alter
alignment:

"Can you go back with no
regrets?"
• I just want out of here.
  (Chaos)
• There's something on my mind.
  (Law)
• First let's find a way out.
  (Neutral)

After the scenes, a new sector
opens up.

- Eridanus 1F

Place looks kind of like Eden
from SMT 2. A demon here, Thoth,
can give an EX Mission, the
start of a mission line.

• EX Mission: The wise man's
  library I

[Chakra Drop x3], [Dis-Stone
x4], [Bead x1] can be found on
this floor as treasures. You'll
want to make your way around to
the eastern stairs to 2F, which
is next to a terminal.

- Eridanus 2F

A Dark area!... and the function
you got last area doesn't seem
to work here. What a pain.
Luckily, this dark area is very
easy to navigate. If you go
straight north until you can't,
then straight west, you will
find your way to a door which
leads to where you need to go.

There's no treasures or anything
here. You'll want to go down the
stairs. Explore more of this
dark area floor if you want, but
there's no need to unless you
want the exploration achievement
for this floor.

- Eridanus 1F

Another area of 1F. Zelenin will
give you a call. However if you
go east you can find a rare
Forma [Goetite] by an easily
accessible secret portal. After
you get it, go to Zelenin
straight north of where you came
onto this floor. A sort of
strange device.

Anyway, take the Goetite back to
the Lab on the Red Sprite right
now. Your DEMONICA's search
function is upgraded to [Forma
Search B]. It may also be a good
idea to get the "Nurse" Sub App
for upcoming trap floors that
cause status ailments.

You can now find more forma out
on the field. Anyway, head back
into the dungeon and make your
way back to where Zelenin was.
Make sure you equip the Nurse or
Medic sub app if you've got it
because of the upcoming ailment
floor tiles, sleep being
especially nasty. Luckily,
running away from a battle will
wake everyone up.

Green floors cause sleep, and
purple cause poison.

[Amrita Soda x2], [Me Patra
Stone x3] can be found along
this pathway. You'll run into
Bugaboo halfway across this
annoying trap tile field, and if
you check north of where you met
him you can find a sleeping
Jimenez. If you wake Jimenez up,
he'll give you [Patra Stone x5].
Continue on past until you reach
a terminal. Save and go up the
stairs beyond it.

- Eridanus 2F

No treasures. A lot of obvious
gate-type portals in between
pillars here. The one you're
looking for is in the southwest
part of this area. It'll lead to
a space manipulation device.
Phase Shift over.

You can grab [Balm of Rising x1]
almost immediately. Look for a
secret door on the east wall
near the entry point and you'll
find a rare Forma inside,
[Asteria Stone]. Zelenin
requests you bring it to her.

You'll be able to find some
stairs down to the north, so
take them down.

- Eridanus 1F

This is a small area that
connects to where you need to
go. If you wake up the sleeping
Strike Team member, he'll give
you [Dis-Poison x5]. You can
find [Soma x1] here in a box,
and a portal in the southwest to
continue south to where you need
to get. Past there, [Agilao
Stone x3], stairs up, and of
course a portal making a
shortcut to the area which
Zelenin is in.

Go see Zelenin. This activates a
teleport to a new area. Go back
for now. South of the teleport
device's original location, take
the stairs up.

Ame no Uzume is here and gives
an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Marebito, the
  foreign god

You can also find a shortcut
back to where you can heal and
save. The stairs north of where
you met Zelenin, past the opened
shortcut will also lead to
another shortcut to this
heal/save area, though nothing
more can be done there for now.

This makes it easy to travel
from the sector entrance to this
heal area and further beyond to
traveled areas.

Back past the teleport device
Zelenin activated, you'll run
into another teleport device
guarded by a Ghoul, though you
can't get through without
"permission" he says. Go up the
stairs beyond.

- Eridanus 2F

Another shortcut to the
heal/save area opens, and south
of there you can begin to
explore by going up to 3F.

- Eridanus 3F

There's a Heal Spot up here
immediately, which is odd
placement given how there's one
not very far away.

In the west and east are two
portals leading to rooms with
demons in them who will
challenge you to specific
battles with rules. In the east
is Kazfiel and the west is
Zouchouten.

From Zouchouten...

• EX Mission: The ever-steeper
  trial I

From Kazfiel...

• EX Mission: Before the holy
  battle I

Defeating them unlocks them for
fusion and gets you items for
Sub Apps. Also, you may have
noticed secret doors in these
rooms you can't open. Come back
later with higher rank Unlock
and Gate Search Main Apps and
you'll be able to challenge the
next heavenly king or angel.

In the south is an elevator. You
can ride it to the "TOP" floor.

- Eridanus TOP

To the west here is a hidden
gate portal that leads to a
terminal and heal spot. A
powerful demon is detected to
the north. However as you
approach it a scene will play
where you and all members of the
Red Sprite team are ordered back
to the ship. You can't progress
anyway. No way to get through
the portal with your current
Gate Search main app.

Go back to the ship for now.

You'll be assigned to a new
mission in Carina.

• Mission: Signal Investigation

- Carina

Inside Carina, take the elevator
in northeast 1F up to 4F. Look
for a hidden door near the
terminal, on the west wall.

Look inside for more portals on
the west wall and you'll trigger
a scene behind one of the doors.
A new main mission will be added
during it.

• Mission: Jack's Bargain

During the scene, you'll get an
alignment question...

"Can we establish cordial
relations?"
• Humans should help each other.
  (Neutral)
• I'd sooner trust the demons.
  (Chaos)
• I don't trust anyone easily.
  (Law)

You can explore what's left to
find [Muscle Drink x3] and [Vi
Incense x1]. You can also pickup
a new EX Mission from a goblin.

• EX Mission: A formal search
  request

The new mission calls to return
to Eridanus and pickup Forma for
Captain Jack.

- Eridanus

Back where the ghoul was
guarding the teleporter earlier
on the way to 3F, you can now
use that teleporter since
Captain Jack's demon will let
you by.

In the room the teleport drops
you in, you can open up a
shortcut in the south with Gate
Search, and if you look around
in the southwest part of the
room will be able to find a
Strike Team member corpse for
the EX Mission "Black box
retrieval II". The west door in
this room leads on...

Beyond here, I hope you like
teleporter mazes, because that's
where we're going to be for now.
In this first room, either the
north or west teleport will lead
to the same spot while the south
leads to the entrance of this
room. Take the north or west,
obviously.

Grab the [Chakra Pot x1] here
and then take the south teleport
tile. Take the east teleport
next, then west. Grab the
[Caladbolg x1], then take the
south teleport. You can find the
[Hydro Apple] needed for the
main objective here. Now take
the north teleport and in this
area, don't go far south but
instead trigger a teleport
midway down.

Head west 1 tile, south 1 tile,
west 1 tile, south 1 tile. At
this destination a forma will be
visible, [Ice-10]. Another one
Jack wanted. You can access the
heal/save area via a shortcut up
the stairway northeast of here.

South of those stairs up is a
portal you can go through.
Explore this new area, but avoid
going through a door in the very
northwest or you'll have to go
through the teleport maze again
or through the opened up
shortcut near the
termina/healspot area hub to get
back. Lots of pitfalls on 2F,
but as long as you avoid that
northwest corner 1F door you
won't get stuck messing around
in that teleport maze again.

You can find [Sacrifice x1] on
the first floor, [Garula Stone
x3], [Bufula Stone x3], [10000
Macca], [Zionga Stone x3]. The
way to proceed is through a gate
portal in the east end of 1F,
which leads up to stairs to 2F.
From this part of 2F, you'll
want to head straight west and
drop down from a pit to a part
of 1F you can only access from
here.

You can go back up to 2F from
here, grab [Lu Incense x1] and
continue on to drop back to 1F
in another new part. From there
you can unlock a shortcut back
to the area you've already been
in. You can unlock several
shortcuts to areas already
explored, and get the [X-Metal]
for Captain Jack as well.

One of the shortcuts is
conveniently placed near the
entrance to this sector. Use it
to get out, and take the forma
back to Carina, to Captain Jack.
The mission Jack's Bargain will
now be complete. Return to the
Red Sprite.

Now in Eridanus, go up to the
top and head towards the ! mark
on the map.

- Eridanus TOP

A Jack's squad member will give
you an upgrade to your Gate
Search function. [Gate Search
C]. Now you can open higher
level portals, which means you
can go behind the door to that
marked !. However, the boss
behind there is very strong and
you probably won't be able to
kill it just yet.

Explore the rest of the floor.
Obviously placed gate-type
portals are there, starting from
the southeast corner of the map.
The floor is symmetrical. [Bead
Chain x1] is along the way east
heading north, and you'll
eventually run into a suspicious
area that you've already mapped
before if you did the EX Mission
with the three Dis back in
Bootes. The conclusion to that
EX Mission takes place here. You
can find out who saved you. If
you accept, you'll get a new EX
Mission.

• EX Mission: Fateful Aid

Further along the path that
loops around this floor you can
find a demon, Dantalian, that
will give another EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Tales of
  investigation

You'll probably need to level up
and fuse demons appropriate for
the next boss because it has an
annoying habit of regenerating
~160 hp every turn, and that's
quite a lot. Level 45 for your
main character or better is
ideal.

The idea is to exploit its
weakness, fire, and to get Co-Op
attacks in. You need demons
resistant or better to Expel or
it'll go poorly. Make sure your
MC also doesn't have a weakness
to Expel with his current armor
or you'll probably die. Thiotimo
Vest is a good choice of armor.
Randall is a good choice of Gun.

Here are three sets of demons,
one for each alignment. Once
again, these are probably not
going to be cheap, but if you
are having trouble with
Ouroboros like a lot of people
do then you will find that using
any set of demons aligned the
same as your MC will make things
easy.

  < Boss: Snake Ouroboros >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 2300 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Fire / St: Phys, Gun / N

Ouroboros is hard. Very hard. If
you're using the demons I list
above, begin the battle by
buffing to +3 with Luster Candy
and throw up Tetraja while
dropping Ouroboros down to -3
with Debilitate and then spam
some Agidyne with the demons. It
should be relatively easy with
that setup, if all goes right.
If she casts Mahama, reuse
Tetraja.

Spells that drop her defense and
raise your offense are pretty
much key if you're not using
really good demons, as the HP
regen that takes place every
round is about 160 hp and
without the damage output you'll
probably either never kill her
due to low damage output, or you
will run out of juice before you
can kill her.

Don't go to +4 or -4 with any
buff or debuff abilities as
Ouroboros knows Silent Prayer
which cancels all parameter
changes on both sides, and will
use it if you go to +4 on
yourself or if you -4 her.

Ouroboros has a few attacks.
Mahama, which is Expel-based
instant death though a
relatively low chance on those
resistant to expel. Wild
Thunder, which is a hit-all Elec
spell. A regular phys attack
that hits twice, and a spell
that causes random status
ailments, Disaster Cycle.

Hopefully, she'll use the phys
attacks and Mahama and not hit
any of your demons with Mahama.
The elec spell is kind of
powerful, and the random status
ailments can be nasty as well if
you get things like Bomb or
Stone. It can be pretty much any
status ailment though, so the
chance of getting your Main
Character petrified by Disaster
Cycle is pretty low.

If all goes well, you should
kill her in 6-7 turns with my
setup. Maybe even less.

With a bad setup, you'll
probably not even do enough
damage to offset the natural
regeneration that occurs every
round. Sucks, yeah.

¯¯¯ After the battle, you'll be
forced out of the boss room
during a scene.

Now you'll need to go destroy
the 4 energy sources explained
during the scene. They're
clearly marked on your map in
areas you'd have already visited
here on the top floor. They're
simply encounters with regular
enemies that have a bit more HP.
No big deal. Crush them.

Now you'll have to go fight
Ouroboros again.
   _______________________
  < Boss: Snake Ouroboros >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 3200 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Fire / St: Phys, Gun / N

The regeneration is gone, but
now there are more attacks and
she has higher HP. One of the
new attacks is Wave of Death, a
hit-all phys skill, so you may
wish to equip a Strong to phys
armor (that still retains Expel
resistance) to your Main
character instead of the
Thiotimo vest suggested for the
last battle with Ouroboros.

Again, use the same buffing
strategy and then use Fire
skills to Co-Op.

This fight is not really any
harder than the previous one.
Perhaps even easier if your
damage output is lowish since it
won't drag on as long.

¯¯¯
• Snake Ouroboros fusion is
  unlocked.

You'll get the [Klein Bottle]
and [Formless Mass] key items.
The main mission Find the
Vanishing Point is complete.
You'll automatically return to
the Red Sprite for some scenes,
one of which has a questiom from
Jimenez.

"What do you think, [main
character first name]?"
• We owe it to mankind.
• Fine, long as it's destroyed.
• I just want to forget it all.

Doesn't seem to affect
alignment, though.

Didn't think it'd be that easy,
did you? After the scenes, it's
time to continue the journey.

Time to begin exploration!
First, take the east door and
map those areas out. You'll find
[Balm of Rising x1] and [Amrita
Soda x2].

In the west hall, you can find a
Demon, Futotama, who if you'd
taken the EX Mission from Ame no
Uzume in Eridanus, will give you
[Tamashiro Mirror]. Further on
you'll find [Soma Drop x1] and
then a terminal. Save. South of
there, a warning about a
powerful demon and a shortcut
secret door.

Make sure you don't have a fire
weakness before you proceed.

If you go east from there,
someone you've already met will
show himself once again. It's
Morax! Or really, Moloch, as he
displays his true self to be.

had thrown together for
Ouroboros still worked just
fine. Use Ice attacks if you've
got them for Co-Ops if you're
using same aligned, etc.

He has Maragidyne instead of
Maragi. That's the only skill
change. Just make sure the main
character is not weak to Fire
and you'll win.

Basically I just buffed to +4
with Luster Candy, debuffed his
attack and attacked a few
rounds. Had I known how little
HP he has and how weak he is, I
probably would have turned on
Auto battle.

If he uses Gehenna, you may wish
to use a Me Patra Stone to
remove the fear effect from your
party members. No better time to
use them, really.

¯¯¯
• Tyrant Moloch fusion is
  unlocked.

Continue on past where
Morax/Moloch busted down the
wall and you'll run into an
event with Louisa Ferre.

A new main mission is added.

• Mission: Defeat the Three
  Demons

So it seems you must re-fight
the demons who carried Rosettas
before, only in their true,
stronger forms. Mitra, Horkus
and Asura await.

Begin with the west door. This
will lead to Mitra.

- Fornax B1F

This is an easy to navigate
floor with a few one-way doors.
You can find Alice here who will
give you an EX Mission. Doing so
will unlock Fiend Alice for
fusion and give [Hexagram],
though you will have to defeat
her and deal with the "Die for
Me!" signature attack in doing
so. Hexagram becomes Main App
[Forma Search C].

• EX Mission: Catch the rabbit!

You can find [Dekunda Stone x2]
in a box here on this floor as
well. Make your way down to B2F.

- Fornax B2F

The theme of this floor and the
ones below it is pitfalls. In
order to get to Mitra, fall down
west of the terminal here on
this floor.

- Fornax B3F

On B3F, search for a hidden door
in the middle and fall down the
pit on the east side.

- Fornax B4F

On B4F, you can collect [Bead
Chain x1] and fall down to B5F
next to a terminal.

- Fornax B5F

Save. Prepare for battle with
Mitra. Equip similar resists
that you'd need to fight him.
You'll notice a broken wall
nearby. East of it, you can find
a rare Forma [Sun Mirror]. When
you head back west, you will
meet Mitra, who also busts in
like the Kool-Aid man like
Moloch did earlier. Mitra, or
should I say, Mithras, shows his
true form.

"We should rule over humans!"
• Why can't we coexist?
  (Neutral)
• That way is wrong. (Law)
• You may be right... (Chaos)

He's actually easier than Mitra
was, comparatively. He now uses
Ice Breath instead of
Mabufudyne, which does less
damage than Mabufudyne, but the
fight is otherwise the same.
Still has Light of Order and
Waking Dream.

He has more HP and hits harder,
but not so much that it's an
issue.

Co-Op with Wind if you can or
just abuse parameter buffing and
slaughter him with your attack
command. I don't know what to
say. Have fun with this one
because harder bosses are coming
soon.

¯¯¯
• Fallen Mithras fusion is
  unlocked.

You'll be forced to return to
the Red Sprite for an emergency
mission to check up on what
Jack's squad is doing.

Head into Jack's base for a
scene with Ryan of Jack's squad.
Back on the Red Sprite, Jimenez
will decide to stay behind and
spy on them, even if you
volunteer to do it.

You can go back to Fornax now
and continue with the three
demons mission.

If you didn't explore the west
stairs from 1F fully, you can do
so to collect [Bead x2], [Attack
Mirror x2], [St Incense x1], and
[Soma x2].

- Fornax 1F

Take the east stairs on 1F next
to get to Horkos.

- Fornax B1F

This is a very straight-forward
floor. Has one treasure chest
with [Chakra Pot x1] and some
stairs down.

- Fornax B2F

When you come to your first
door, you'll unfortunately have
to enter a dark area which you
again cannot see in. Shame.
However, this one is easy to
navigate. Just go west and at
the end of the path, search
south for a door.

Find the next door on this
linear path to enter another
dark area. From this one, go all
the way east, then south 2 steps
and face west to enter a door.
Grab the [Magic Mirror x2] in
here, then go back into the dark
area and trace your way back to
the very entrance of the dark
area. From it, go south all the
way and search for a door east.
Follow the path to the stairs
and go down them.

- Fornax B3F

A Heal Spot is readily
accessible, and beyond it, a
dark room. There are a lot of
"places" you can go on this
floor, but basically the only
place of worth is to make your
way northwest of the entry point
to get to a pretty easy-to-find
door on the west wall, and go
through. Through there, you'll
find a door to another dark area
which is literally 3 tiles with
a door in the southeast. Take
the stairs down.

- Fornax B4F

Use the terminal straight ahead.
Head into the south door, into a
dark room.

Go two tiles west, then all the
way south, then east and enter.
Go down the stairs and grab [Ma
Incense x1] then go back up and
into the dark room you just came
from.

Back in the dark room, head west
1 tile, all the way north, all
the way west, then north, then
west, then south. Enter the
door, then go down the stairs.

- Fornax B5F

Use the Heal Spot and terminal
to save. Prepare to fight Horkos
again. Same resists and general
demon setup Now head through the
1-way door. Immediately, your
Forma search should pickup a
forma. Go grab it, it's rare
forma [Moon Mirror]. Head along
the only path available to you
and you'll meet a familiar
porcine face. Actually, the
group used for Ouroboros still
works here as well due to their
Fire spells.

He also busts through a wall as
if he were in a Kool-Aid
commercial, showing his true
form, Orcus.

"Tremble in the face of death!"
• I'm not going to die here.
  (Neutral)
• I'm not afraid to die. (Chaos)

Weird design. Nothing like the
classic Orcus design which was
what Horkos was using.

Similar to Moloch and Mithras,
he isn't much harder than when
you fought his other form. The
fight is much the same. He has
more HP and hits harder, and he
summons a more powerful
Katakirauwa. That's... about it.
He only has 2400 HPs whereas
Horkos had 1800. That's a mere
600 HP difference and you're
much more powerful now than you
were in Carina.

¯¯¯
• Reaper Orcus fusion is
  unlocked.

After the battle, you are once
again recalled because Jimenez
is a piss-poor excuse of a spy.
Make your way out of this dump
by going up the stairs available
to you in the northeast -- not
west, then whe on 4F go through
into the dark area.

Go 2 tiles west, 1 south, and
you'll be on 4F next to the
terminal. Use it to get out of
there.

Back on the Red Sprite, scenes.
A new mission is added.

• Mission: Save Crewman Jimenez

Head to the Lab and Irving tell
you the Sun Mirror and Moon
Mirror can be turned into a new
Main App with a little something
else added to them. Save up,
heal up and head into Jack's
Squad HQ.

- Jack's Squad HQ 1F

Head forward and you'll have to
fight two Human Soldiers. When
you win, go through the door.

You can immediately access a
terminal and Heal Spot. Go west
into the room and talk to the
soldiers in the middle to begin
a fight with two Human Soldiers
and Human Sergeant.

Now exit this room and take the
east path, and enter the
southeast door. Another fight,
the same as in the last room.
Flip the switch to off after the
battle.

Explore the rest of 1F. The door
leading to the Lightning is open
but the hatch to the ship is
shut. There's obvious secret
doors in the northwest and in
the northeast room. Behind the
NW one is [Life Stone x5] and a
nother secret door behind which
you may find a random Forma.
Behind the northeast one is rare
Forma [Piercing Stone]. Take it
back to the Red Sprite's Lab.

Irving will upgrade your
Visualizer function to
[Visualizer B]. Back in Jack's
Squad HQ, head down the stairs
in southern 1F.

- Jack's Squad HQ B1

Try to check the door, but it'll
say it's locked. Search the room
for a portal and go through it.
Continue and enter the door
beyond. A fork, north or south.
Take the south path and grab the
[Frag Grenade x2] from the south
room and then take the north.
You will meet Louisa Ferre once
more.

Past where you met our obvious
friend, go into the dark area.
Your new Visualizer upgrade can
now let you see in the red dark
areas. Nice. Go into the first
room you see to get [Bead x2]
then go back into the dark.

Continue along that linear path
and enter the first room you
come across. In this room, ask
the scientist about Jimenez's
whereabouts. Ask about him being
a scientist afterwards, and
he'll give you the code. Back in
the dark room, take the
southmost door here and grab the
box with [Nerve Gas x2]. Now go
back to the beginning of the
floor.

You can now enter the locked
door. Do what you want during
this scene, the results are no
different. Wow... what a scene.
Very reminiscent of what the
Chaos Hero did to himself in SMT
1 if you've played it. Choosing
to willingly fuse Jimenez with
Bugaboo during this scene gives
a small shift toward Chaos
alignment, but as I said before
it happens no matter what.

You now need to head to the
Lightning, which is on 1F's
north end.

Get ready for a hard boss fight.
The trick to this one is to try
to charm him while dumping as
much damage as possible on him,
preferably while you have a team
with demons that reflect Gun.
Randy Shot from the Desonberi
gun is a good choice. Charm
Strike or Marin Karin demon
skills are decent damage dealers
that may charm, too. Make sure
no one is weak to Gun as that's
Captain Jack's main form of
damage output.

If you need demons, here they
are. There's just a set of three
of them for this battle as Jack
has no weakness to exploit for
Co-Ops. They're varied
alignment, but more importantly
they all repel Gun attacks.

- Jack's Squad HQ 1F

Jimenez is determined to get
revenge on Captain Jack, so head
up there to Jack's Squad's ship,
the Lightning. After the scene,
you will fight Jack.
   __________________
  < Boss: Human Jack >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 2016 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Nu: Expel, Curse <

He has no weakness. So it
doesn't matter what demon
alignments you use.

Jack comes with two Spirit
Pisaca demons. You will want to
eliminate them ASAP to stop them
from potentially causing Bomb
status to any of your party
members. If it happens, use
Bomdi or Amrita spells or a Dis-
Bomb or Amrita Soda or Shower
item to remove bomb as needed.
It's a rather nasty effect, as
you probably know by now if
you've had an enemy use it on
you. The Pisacas are weak to
Fire.

Captain Jack himself can use a
weak normal phys attack and
nasty heavy damage random gun
attack called Rain Strike. He
can also heal himself for
400-1000 HP with "Pure Blue"
which also removes all debuffs
from him. He can also use Sunset
Melody, which does some almighty
damage to the party and reduces
attack by -1. Dekunda or Dekunda
Stones are nice here if you
aren't using Tarukaja or Luster
Candy, which you really should
be anyway.

Pure Blue is why charm is
recommended. If you don't charm
him, the only other viable
strategy is to use gun
reflecting demons and *hope* his
random attacks hit them to
reflect the gun shots back to
him, or perhaps spam Attack
Mirrors and hope for him to use
Rain Strike although he may
choose to just use Pure Blue the
next round anyway, wasting a
good precious item.

To begin the battle, take out
the Pisacas. They're weak to
fire if you want to go the co-op
route. If you used the Alraune
demon I've listed above or have
fused your own demon with Luster
Candy, begin to buff up to +4 as
Jack cannot remove your buffs
and you'll need the extra damage
the attack buff gives.

With your Main character and any
demons that can charm, keep
trying to stick a Charm to him.
When you get it, go all out.
Hopefully you'll kill him before
he uses Pure Blue again. If the
charm wears out, perhaps try to
go all out and kill him before
he uses Pure Blue before you try
to charm again.

It is possible you could take
him from full to dead without
charming him, but the chances
are quite small. So use Charm.
It doesn't have a high chance to
work, but when it does you've
likely won the battle. High
powered physicals such as Mortal
Jihad should be unloaded on him
once you get him charmed.

My own custom demon team built
for this battle works off of a
combination of reflecting gun
attacks and damage+charm
attacks. If you use it, you
should not have much of a
problem winning the fight long
as Jack doesn't just kind of
decide to Pure Blue over and
over and...

¯¯¯ No matter what you choose
after the battle, Jimenez will
do the same thing to ol' Jack...
but your choice can affect
alignment.

> Jimenez raised his hand...!
• Stop Jimenez (Law)
• Watch (Neutral)

Mission Save Crewman Jimenez is
now completed. You'll
automatically be taken back to
the Red Sprite. Arthur will give
you rare Forma [Star Mirror]
which was confiscated from
Jack's Squad.

An alignment choice takes place
during the scene on the Red
Sprite.

"Should Jimenez be relieved?"
• He's not a problem. (Chaos)
• We should wait and see.
  (Neutral)
• Probably so. (Law)

Take the rare Forma the Lab
after the scenes. Irving will
transform the Sun Mirror, Moon
Mirror, and Star Mirror into an
upgraded [Enemy Search B]
function. This will be needed
soon, and aside can be used to
find the hidden Fiend clan
demons at a higher rate.

Afterwards, it is time to head
back into Fornax.

- Fornax

Back here in Fornax, you can do
two things. Fully explore the
east side where Orcus was now
that you can see in the red dark
areas, or head on with the main
mission in the central door on
1F. There's no items or anything
left down on the east side-- I
had you grab them before. But if
you want to explore, then
explore. Head down to B1F of
Fornax via the middle stairway
on 1F to continue with the main
mission!

- Fornax B1F

Simply head straight through the
doors and go down.

- Fornax B2F

Grab the [Soma Drop x1] and go
down the stairs.

- Fornax B3F

Grab the [Amrita Soda x1] and
continue down.

- Fornax B4F

Head on down.

- Fornax B5F

Save and heal here. Then go into
the main room. The Demonica will
react. Choose to Perform a scan.

You will have to fight Spirit
Strange Demon, who can use
Maragion and Asura Roga, the
same annoying skill that causes
Rage that Asura used. It's not
very difficult, so take it out.

Afterwards, prepare a party
that's similar in resistances to
when you fought Asura back in
Delphinus. Emphasis on physical
resistance this time though,
since the boss only uses
Maragion for fire spells but the
physical damage output is much
scarier this time around. "Armor
Vest" armor plus a good gun with
Ice spells such as Frost Cannon
will suffice.

Head down the stairs to 6F whe
you're ready.

- Fornax B6F

You'll meet Asura again, or
rather Asherah. No Kool-Aid man
antics this time though. And of
course, alignment stuff. The
demons used for Ouroboros should
still be sufficient here at this
point if you're still using
them, so I still don't need to
hand you out new passwords...
yet.

"Destruction will rejuvenate
Earth!"
• I won't let you. (Neutral)
• You're distorting things.
  (Law)
• Maybe you're right... (Chaos)

  [ HP: 2500 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Ice / St: Elec, Gun / Nu

Unlike Moloch, Orcus and
Mithras, Asherah is no pushover.

Much like Asura, she'll open up
with Asura Roga on the first
round. Guard. Next round buff up
with Luster Candy if you've got
it, or Rakukaja otherwise and
debuff her with Arm Shot/War
Cry/Tarunda/Debilitate, whatever
you've got. No more than +3/-3
or she'll remove them with
Dekaja/Dekunda.

Every 5-6 turns generally, Asura
Roga is reused.

She uses Maragion and rarely the
same Black Flame random heavy
damage fire spell that can hit
0-2 times on everyone that Asura
had. This isn't as deadly as
Asura using Maragidyne
constantly was, though, which is
why Phys resistance is better
for this fight than fire
resistance. Asherah tends to use
the Ashura attack more often and
is pretty painful with it.

If she uses Charge, make sure to
guard next turn with those who
are not resistant to Physical
because a Charge + Ashura combo
will kill them for sure.

She only has a few hundred HP
more than Asura did, but the
hard part is finding turns where
you're not raged or need to heal
in order to whittle it away. Co-
Ops using Ice spells are
recommended where possible.

Things can go bad though, like
Ashura randomly killing your
healers with a multi-hit Ashura
on them, but as long as your
Main Character is strong to
Phys, you don't have -too- much
to worry about here...

Slug it out and hope for the
best with how she chooses her
attacks.

¯¯¯
• Lady Asherah fusion is
  unlocked.

The Main Mission Defeat the
Three Demons is also concluded.
Now you have to go kill the one
who revived them.

Map out the whole accessible
floor. You'll have to go through
dark areas but it won't be a
problem since you can see in
them. There's no secret doors
accessible from where you're at.
So when you've mapped it all
out, use the space manipulation
device in the south and shift on
over.

Now explore the shifted area.
You can grab [Megido Stone x2],
open up a secret door in the
northeast of the phase shifted
area which you can later find a
treasure [Great Chakra x1] in
the northeast part of the
normal, non-phase shifted floor
by passing through the now-
opened doorway.

Explore the southwest end and
open up the portal down there
for a shortcut back to the south
end of the floor if you choose
to shift back and get that
treasure.

It's easy to find your way to
the stairs down to 7F, so go
ahead and make your way down
there after you've gotten any
treasures you want.

- Fornax B7F

You can save and heal right away
in the first room. North is the
boss' mark on your map. Make
sure you're not weak to Ice.
Hardwired is a good armor to be
using, and any gun with an Elec
attack if you're using same
aligned demons for Co-Op.

Here's a set of password demons.

  [ HP: 4500 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Elec / St: Gun / Nu: Fir

Very easy boss if you're
prepared with buffs and Dekaja
or Debilitate.

Tiamat uses Mabufudyne, Glacial
Blast, and Mother Earth, all ice
spells. Mother Earth heals her
for about half the damage done
to you, but if you buff up this
won't be much and in fact will
maybe be like half of what your
main character can do with a
sword strike. No kidding.

In addition, she uses Luster
Candy and Sunset Melody. You
know what Luster Candy does, and
if you saw Jack use it, you know
what Sunset Melody does. Sunset
Melody does almighty damage to
the group and lowers your attack
parameter by -1. Again, no
problem if you have Luster Candy
or Tarukaja on one of your own
characters to offset the loss of
attack power.

You just remove her Luster Candy
with Dekaja or offset it back to
0 with Debilitate, buff yourself
to +4 with Luster Candy or other
and slug away with powerful
physicals or Elec spells. She
can't Dekaja your +4'd
parameters.

Just don't use debuffs on her or
she'll use Pure Blue. Yes, the
same skill that Captain Jack had
that heals a sizable amount of
HP. Not good at all.

Another thing you shouldn't do
is use a reflect spell or item
like Tetrakarn or a Magic
Mirror. She will use Diarahan if
you do, which is of course a
full heal.

¯¯¯
• Drake Tiamat fusion is

You'll get [Salt Lump], [EM:

Fornax's Exotic Matter is

- Grus 1F

Looks a lot like the lower
sections of Antlia with
different colors here. Anyway,
avoid the space manipulation
device here for now-- the angel
won't let you use it anyway.

This floor is full of
"illusions" that when you
approach, may either go away or
disappear. In actuality, they
are either walls or just open
passageways that reveal
themselves as you get close to
them. If they won't open, it's
just a wall.

There really isn't much to do on
this floor-- you can explore and
find a portal in the northwest
that'll only open if you have
Gate Search E from the Ame no
Uzume EX Mission earlier, behind
which you can find rare Forma
[Cornucopia]. This rare forma
becomes [Unlock E] Main App back
at the Lab.

If you're having trouble finding
this door, it's almost right
next to a Strike Team member
corpse where you can find the
black box for this sector if
you're on the Black box
retrieval II EX Mission.

In the northeast is another
similar portal that'll only open
for Gate Search E which has
[Bead of Life x1] behind it, but
aside from that all you can do
now is go explore until you meet
Mastema again and see the scene
after which you'll get called
back to the Red Sprite.

A new main mission will be added
and you'll have to do the same
thing here, regardless of your
choices you make at this point.
Your choice to Jimenez and
Zelenin's questions affects
alignments, though.

"You're ready to rock, right?"
• Let's lock and load. (Chaos)
• We should wait and see.
  (Neutral)

"Please, [main character's last
name]..."
• All right. (Law)
• Out of the question. (Neutral)

• Mission: Pacify Jack's Squad

If you got the Cornucopia
earlier, it'll become the
[Unlock E] Main App. Note that
Unlock E isn't an "ultimate"
unlocker app that'll open up any
door-type portal, it's simply
used to open up E-type locked
door portals.

Head back into Grus and this
time use the space manipulation
device near the entrance to
shift on over. The angel will
let you.

Phase Shift over. In the Phase
Shifted area, you're going to
have to deal with a simplistic
teleport maze. In the area with
the terminal and Heal Spot, loop
around and take the teleport
positioned just about south from
the heal spot.

Here, if you are Law aligned,
you may follow the path around
to the north and enter a room
for a treasure [Ma Incense x1].
Otherwise, simply go a few tiles
north of where you entered to
teleport to a new destination.

Head straight south until you
hit a wall, then turn east and
go east 2 tiles, south 2 tiles,
then go west and loop around to
a door. Inside, grab the [Mahama
Stone x2]. Head back to where
you teleported into this area,
and then from there go south
until you hit the wall, east
until the wall, north to the
wall, then east again. Explore
the areas beyond this point
until you hit a teleport. Note
that if you went into a door
here and found an angel that
won't let you pass, you
shouldn't worry about it. That's
New Game+ content.

Now, here, follow the path but
avoid going into a north dead
end or you'll be teleported back
to the terminal and heal spot
from earlier and need to
backtrack. You'll run into
Mastema. Make your choices
during this scene and note
another SMT1-like moment, like
what occured with Law Hero, if
you've played that game.

Your choice during the scene can
affect alignment.

"What do you think of my
rebirth?"
• It's beautiful. (Law)
• It's awe-inspiring (Neutral)
• No problems here. (Chaos)

Now you can take the way out via
the teleport I told you to avoid
earlier.

Go back to the Red Sprite. Now
head to Jack's Squad HQ after
the scene.

In Jack's Squad HQ, go to the
Lightning for another scene. The
main mission Pacify Jack's Squad
is now completed. Jimenez will
give you the [Giant's Fang] rare
Forma during the scene. Take it
to the lab. Phase Shifter will
be upgraded to [Phase Shifter
B].

Which of course means you can
now access another area at the
space manipulation points. In
Grus, use the space manipulation
device and go to phast shift to
area B.

Now explore this area. Yeah,
another teleport maze is ahead
in order to continue. Nothing
serious though, just like on the
side with the angels.

After the first teleport, you
can take the right teleporter
for [Mamudo Stone x2] or the
left to continue. At the left
teleporter, there's only one way
you can go to continue. After
the teleport there, take the
first left and go into the door
on the left in the hallway.

In this room, you can talk to
Grendel about Maya, and he'll
ask you to do something. What
you answer here can be a minor
alignment shift...

"Sound good?"
• Sure. (Chaos)
• I refuse. (Law)
• Let me think. (Neutral)

... but does not actually
reflect your choice on what to
do to proceed. He will tell you
to return to the ship and talk
it out "as humans do" first.

West and north of Grendel's room
are doors that will only open
for you if you are Chaos aligned
and have items behind them-- [St
Incense x1] and [Megido Stone
x1]. Step on the teleport near
Grendel's room to return right
next to the terminal of this
floor. You'll meet Jimenez here
next to the terminal for a short
scene with him.

Return to the entrance to the
sector and a scene with Zelenin
will take place, with another
choice.

• By all means, sing. (Law)
• That won't be necessary.
  (Chaos)
• Let me think. (Neutral)

Again though, here this choice
has no impact on what you will
actually do. You should return
to the Red Sprite.

You must make your decision here
about what to do to lower the
barrier so that you can reach
Maya. The choices do affect your
alignment, but has nothing to do
with determining your ending
path.

They are...

"Should we accept the demons'
terms?"
• We should. (Chaos)
• We shouldn't. (Neutral)

(if you select "We
shouldn't"...)

"Should we request her
assistance?"
• We should. (Law)
• We shouldn't. (Neutral)

These are simply alignment
choices, however...

Your actions determine what you
do.

You may choose the Law choice to
have Zelenin sing by talking to
her at the Grus entrance and
asking for her to sing. Then you
must head toward Grendel's room,
and an event will take place.

You may choose the Neutral
approach by talking to Grendel
and then choosing to force it
open by fighting him. He's
actually not much harder than
the random encounter Grendel, so
uh, no need to really write
anything about this.

You may choose the Chaos choice
to kill Jack's Squad. You need
to go to Jack's Squad HQ and go
to where the Lightning ship is,
where you'll have to fight Ryan.

It's the same as the Jack fight,
except he has less HP and no
Pisaca demons.

¯¯¯ Report back to Grendel after
you kill Ryan if you do this.

- Grus 1F

Whichever method you choose, the
barrier in the southern part of
the Grus 1F phase shift B area
will go away if you go inspect
the door. Go beyond the door for
a scene with Gore, then continue
on and Gore will send you the
location of Maya via comm. Go
down the stairs beyond.

- Grus B1F

Go straight ahead and use the
terminal in plain sight. Hope
you like teleports and
conveyors. That's what this part
is about. When you first come to
the conveyors, ride the one
going north, which will drop
through a teleporter. Follow the
path here to more conveyors,
then take the west one. When it
stops, again take the west one
and go through the door. Grab
the box with [Revival Bead x2]
and then get onto the conveyor
again. When it stops, go onto
the east conveyor this time.
You'll teleport at the end of
it.

Loop around here until you come
to a fork. Take the west path
and go down the stairs you'll
reach.

- Grus B2F

Teleport maze time! Take the
west teleport. You'll be in a
room with a terminal. Use it if
you want and take the teleport
east of it. Ahead is some damage
tile floors. In the northwest
part of the patch is a gate-type
portal that you can access. Open
it up and go through. You'll now
be in another spot with
teleports. Take the south one.

From your immediate location, go
into the west and east rooms to
grab [Balm of Rising x2] and
[Criticker x1]. Outside those
rooms, go north until you're at
a fork and don't move. Now take
the paths west and east of the
fork to get [Chakra Pot x1] and
[Dis-Stone x3]. At the fork, go
north now to teleport.

Now go back up the stairs to 1F,
directly to your south.

- Grus B1F

Explore the rest of this area to
teleport back to the beginning
of the conveyor area here on
B1F. Ride the north conveyor
again, but when you teleport
this time take the east conveyor
afterwards, which drops you onto
a teleport. At its
destination...

You can use the terminal you
come across if you wish, then
ride the conveyor to the west of
it, then ride the small north
conveyor and go through the
door. You'll automatically ride
a conveyor. Go through the door
in plain view after it stops.
Loop around this area and go
through the door, and you'll
automatically ride yet another
conveyor. Go through the door
after it. Now a fork.

Go north 3 tiles and east
through the door. Don't move,
then grab the box with [Bead
x3]. Head back through the door
and go north to hit a
teleporter. Go 2 tiles south now
without touching the conveyors
to hit another teleport. Now go
north through this hallway and
through the door. Turn north and
open the box for [Bead of Life
x1], then step on the conveyor
and make your way through
explored territory until the
fork before I told you to go
north and grab the Bead x3 box
at before. Stop there then go
west this time to hit a conveyor
that will drop you on a teleport
this time.

Loop your way around until you
reach a fork in the road, and
take the south. Go down the
stairs when you reach them.

- Grus B2F

More teleports. Take the east
one, then go down the stairs.

- Grus B3F

One way door maze! Not cool
because this one is actually
somewhat complex. From the
entrance, take them in this
order: south, south, south then
go up the stairs.

- Grus B2F

To begin, step on the east
teleport here. Now, go to your
west and at the dead end search
the north wall for a portal, and
go on through it. Grab the [Soma
x2] box and get out of this
room. Back here, you can either
go up the stairs to B1F and open
a shortcut to the beginning of
Grus B1F if you'd like, or take
the teleport to the south to go
back to stairs down to B3F. Open
up the shortcut if you'd like,
then use the south teleport and
go back down the stairs to B3F.

- Grus B3F

Take doors in the following
order: West, west, north, west,
south, west. Go up the stairs.

- Grus B2F

Take the teleport to the west to
begin here. Now, loop around
this by going south, then east,
then north, ignoring the first
west fork you come across.
You'll come to a terminal.
Northeast of the terminal is a
teleport. Take it. Now take the
north teleporter here. All you
can do in the next part is go
west to teleport. Now here, take
the first east to the end and
teleport.

Go west to teleport, then take
the east teleport. Ride the
conveyor, and when it stops go
east instead of north to
teleport. Go all the way east
now and search the south wall
for a portal, and go through.
Grab the [Ag Incense x1] from
the box and then go back outside
the door. Take the north
teleport. Ride the conveyor and
look around. There'll be a
terminal. West of the terminal
is a teleport. Use it.

All you can do is go east a bit
to teleport. Afterwards, take
the south teleport. Now take the
east one. Small strip, so just
go east to teleport. Take the
south teleport. Ride the
conveyor, and when it stops go
west instead of north to
teleport. Loop around here and
take the first west you come to.
Go down the stairs to the south.

- Grus B3F

One-way door maze again. From
where you are, take the doors;
north, east, south, east, north,
east, north, north, west, south.
Now go up the stairs.

- Grus B2F

Search this area. Real
simplistic. You will find a rare
Forma [Remedium] in the north
end. Take it and go up the
stairs to the far south.

- Grus B1F

Go northwest and through a door.
Don't move when you go through,
but turn north and open up a box
for [Amrita Shower x1]. Now go
back down the stairs the way you
came in, use the nearby terminal
and warp out to the Red Sprite.

The rare Forma Remedium becomes
[Unlock C] at the Lab.

Head back down to Grus B1F and
from the first terminal, take a
north. You can now unlock that
door. Do so and head through.
Unlock the next door on the east
wall and go through to grab
[Dekunda Stone x2]. Now go down
the easily accessible stairs to
B2F.

From here, take the stairs north
of where you found the Remedium
rare forma. Open the door here
on B1F and go up the now
accessible stairs to 1F.

- Grus 1F

Powerful demon detected! Save
and heal here if you need, then
head in. You will need
preferably powerful physical
demons or demons of the same
alignment who have a regular
attack of the Gun type, or Gun
attribute attack skills. Phys
resistance is good, as is an
accessory that prevents being
Stoned. Dekaja is good to remove
her annoying buff that makes it
hard to hit her. You could use
Dekaja Stones if you'd like, if
you have some. Luster Candy
couldn't hurt either.

... but if you're lazy and have
deep pockets, here are some
passwords.

Never use a Gun elemental skill
or an elemental or almighty
spell. She will counter with an
instant-kill that is neither
Expel nor Curse and is 100%
effective meaning game over if
you attack that way with your
main character. Regular gun
attribute attack skills are
fine. Just not stuff like Gust
Shot or whatever that would
actually be an elemental or
almighty attribute.

When she uses Illusory Ritual, a
skill that says it's doubled her
agility, you need to Dekaja or
it'll be much harder to hit her.
It does wear off, but she will
recast it the turn after it
does.

Either use the gun-type regular
attack demons to trigger Co-Op,
or use powerful physical skills.

Her abilities are the
aforementioned Illusory Ritual,
Ultraviolence, a powerful hit-
all physical skill and all four
single target -dyne regular
elemental spells as well as more
powerful elemental spells such
as Agi Gate, Bufu Gate etc.

Finally, there's a skill she
uses called Evil Vortex that
does damage and can cause Stone
status. If it hits your MC with
Stone status, that's game over,
friend. Make yourself a Supple
Ring if you find this to be
problematic.

Having Luster Candy is helpful.
Buff yourself to +3 because at
+4 she will use Dekaja. War Cry,
Tarunda, Rakunda, and Acid
Breath or just Debilitate are
useful lowering her damage and
her defense, but again no more
than -3 on the Atk and Def
parameters, or she'll Dekunda
them off.

At +3 agility parameter on your
party, you do stand a decent
chance of hitting her even when
she has Illusory Ritual up.

If you're not using gun attack
skills to trigger Co-Ops with
your main character, the
Murakumo Clone sword for the
main character is a good choice
as it may occasionally charm
her.

This fight isn't too hard with
the correct preparation, but can
go bad if you're unlucky and
don't have Stone protected for
example.

¯¯¯
• Night Maya fusion is unlocked.

You will get [Sweet Liqueur] and
[EM: Grus]. The main mission
Grus's Exotic Matter is
completed.

A lot of scenes will play. A
whole lot. It's getting real.

- Horologium 1F

Just a warning, but if you are
planning on being Law or Chaos,
then I recommend you set
yourself up with demons that are
strong or better to Phys and Gun
with good buffs/debuffs and
elemental spells because you're
going to have one hell of a boss
fight coming up here.

If you bought the Law/Chaos
teams I supplied for Maya above,
though, they should suffice as
they have all that's needed to
win. The Law team doesn't have
any physical/gun resistance, but
they have the debuffs, buffs and
heals needed. I blame the lack
of good Law demons in that level
range.

I would highly recommend using
the Goblin alignment trick right
now if you want a specific
alignment path ending or to do
any alignment-specific EX
Missions like the 4th one for
the angels or heavenly kings in
Eridanus. As in right now,
before you do anything in
Horologium. You will not be able
to change your alignment at all
after the first events in there.

You cannot do anything here in
Horologium for now aside from
head north to the elevator. Ride
it down to its only destination,
B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Try to enter the door just south
of you to meet Gore. Scene time.
During the scenes, you'll
automatically return to the Red
Sprite.

Here, you will make your choice
as to who you will support.

If you are far-leaning Law, you
are locked into the Law path
automatically.

If you are Law, but not very far
into Law, you will get these
choices:

"Will you sing God's eternal
praise?"
• I will. (Stay Law and locked
  into Law path)
• I won't. (Go to next question)

"Who would you entrust the
future to?"
• The human race. (Alignment
  shift to Neutral and locked
  into Neutral path)
• The god of law and order.
  (Stay Law and locked into Law
  path)

If you are Neutral, you will get
the following choices:

"Would you host a demon in
yourself?"
• I would. (Alignment shift to
  Chaos and locked into Chaos
  path)
• I wouldn't. (Stay Neutral and
  go to next question)

"Will you sing God's eternal
praise?"
• I will. (Alignment shift to
  Law and locked into Law path)
• I won't. (Stay Neutral and go
  to next question)

"Who would you entrust the
future to?"
• The human race. (Stay Neutral
  and locked into Neutral path)
• A just, righteous God.
  (Alignment shift to Chaos and
  locked into Chaos path)

If you are Chaos but not far-
leaning, you will get these
choices:

"Would you host a demon in
yourself?"
• I would. (Stay Chaos and
  locked into Chaos path)
• I wouldn't. (Go to next
  question)

"Who would you entrust the
future to?"
• The human race. (Alignment
  shift to Neutral and locked
  into Neutral path)
• The free demons. (Stay Chaos
  and locked into Chaos path)

If you are far into Chaos, you
are locked into the Chaos path
automatically.

Dialogues will slightly differ
based on your current alignment,
and your choice determines your
ending as well as some bosses,
events and available EX
Missions. Once chosen, you will
not be able to change your
alignment again until you begin
a New Game or New Game+.

Make your choice if possible,
and continue using the
Walkthroughs below for each
path. On Law and Chaos paths,
you will have to fight Gore
because he doesn't quite agree
with those ideologies that to
him are giving up on the
infinite potential and future
he's seen in humanity with his
ubergestalt powers or whatever.
That's why I said to prepare a
group that resists or better to
phys/gun and has good
buffs/debuffs and elemental
spells a bit earlier if you plan
on being Law or Chaos.

By choosing the Neutral path,
you choose to fight for the
freedom and future of humanity.
Commander Gore gives you the
rare Forma [Clement Bell] and
the power to see Mem Aleph's
true form, then disappears.

Arthur is reactivated and issues
new orders.

• Mission: Bomb Materials
  Retrieval

Talk to Kato in the Command Room
for more info on the locations
of the Cosmic Eggs. Take the
Clement Bell to the Lab and get
the [Unlock D] function for your
DEMONICA. At the Deck, a Strike
Team member reports that the
elevator in Horologium is busted
and Arthur suggests that you
should focus on the other
matters for now.

For now, we need to collect the
bomb materials. Head into
Antlia.

- Antlia

On 1F, go to the north end of
the floor and unlock the door
that opens to your new Unlock D
function. Very straight-forward
area. When you reach the C-type
dark areas (yellow), go through
the middle door and look for the
exit east, along the south wall.
Save at the terminal here, then
search the wall to the east for
a portal and go through.

You'll meet Wu Kong and have to
fight him.

  < Boss: Fury Wu Kong >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 1300 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Ice, Elec / St: Fire / N

Just use attacks that are not
Phys, Fire, Gun, Expel, or Curse
on him. Preferably Ice and Elec
for Demon Co-Ops if you'd like.
He doesn't have much HP. I
killed him in two turns with the
Elec shot from my gun and added
demon Co-Ops.

¯¯¯ You get [Cosmic Egg #1] for
winning. Leave Antlia now. Go to
Carina.

- Carina

Go up to 2F and phase shift over
to dimension B at the south
device. Work your way north and
go through the door unlocked
with the Unlock D App. Save your
game at the terminal here, then
search for a portal south of the
terminal. Go through.

You will meet and have to fight
Zhu Yin.

  < Boss: Dragon Zhu Yin >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 1400 / MP: 9999 ]
  > St: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse <

Simply fire away with Physicals
or non-gun attacks. He, like Wu
Kong, has very little HP and
should die in a few turns. Keep
your HP high though, as he knows
Megido spells. Buff and debuff
spells are worthless as Zhu Yin
knows Silent Prayer which
removes all buffs and debuffs on
both sides.

¯¯¯ After the fight, you acquire
[Cosmic Egg #3].

You can leave Carina now, or you
can explore the phase shift B
areas on 2F and 3F to pickup
some items -- [Great Chakra x1],
[Bead Chain x1], [Bead of Life
x1] and [Amrita Shower x2] and
THEN leave Carina!

Go to Delphinus next.

- Delphinus 1F

On 1F, you can now open the
locked door near Kudlak. More
conveyors. Ride the one of the
west two to the north, then go
east and search for a portal. Go
through and hit the switch, then
go back out and ride the
conveyor to your north. Follow
at the turn ahead, go straight
south until you stop, then go
west and ride the westmost
conveyor. When that conveyor
stops, search west for a portal
and go through it.

Now ride the conveyor north,
flip the switch to change the
directions of the conveyors back
to normal, and ride the conveyor
back south, going through the
secret door you just opened. Go
south down the conveyor, then
east past the next conveyor, and
after you turn going north, go
onto the first conveyor you
reach. Go south when that
conveyor stops.

You can now use an elevator and
open up a short back to the
beginning of the floor south of
the elevator. Take the elevator
up to 9F.

- Delphinus 9F

Search for a portal to the
southwest and go through it. In
this hallway, there are portals
to the west. One going north and
one south. Through the south,
[Great Chakra x1]. Through the
north, a path to a terminal.
West of the terminal, search the
south wall for a portal. Go
through.

You will meet and have to fight
Divine Cherub.

  < Boss: Divine Cherub >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 1200 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Elec / Nu: Expel, Curse 

Another LOW hp "boss." Use Elec
attacks for max efficiency with
Co-Ops, or just physical/gun
attribute skills. You'll win in
like 3 rounds tops. He does know
Megidola and Mahamaon, though by
wearing most armors, the Hama
skill can't touch you.

¯¯¯ You get [Cosmic Egg #4].
Leave Delphinus. Enter Bootes.

- Bootes

Take the elevators in the palace
up to 6F. Open the door next to
you with the Unlock D function
and ride the elevator beyond it
up to 8F. Grab the [Soma x2] to
the south then go through the
door here. Take the door in the
southeast of this big room, then
go east to the terminal and
save. Go north of the terminal,
and down the stairs.

Search just south of you for a
portal, and go through. Choose
to search the area here to get
[Nuke Warhead]. Zelenin is here,
and you will have to fight
her...

If you're using my Neutral team
that worked for Maya, it will
also work just fine right here.

Her attacks as as follows:

Wave of Death, a hit-all
physical similar in power to
Hades Blast. Megido Storm, an
Elec spell that hits all. Right
Hand, which heals her for over
300 HP and raises all of her
battle statistics (Attack, Def,
Agility). Counter it with
Debilitate or Dekaja. Sinner's
Song, which causes almighty
damage and can charm those it
hits-- she won't use it until
her HP is low.

Her regular attack also hits
all.

The best strategy here is
concentrate on buff and debuff
spells. Luster Candy is great
for buffs, but don't exceed +3
or she'll Dekaja. Debilitate you
can get from Thoth or Rangda
sources, two demons you may have
fused so far -- Thoth being much
lower leveled. It is the debuff
equivalent of Luster Candy.
Again, do not stack past -3 or
she'll Dekunda herself.

When she uses Right Hand,
counter it with Debilitate to
drop her stats down to -3 again.
Use physical or non-elec magic
attribute attacks or use Wind to
trigger Co-Ops. With the buffs
and debuffs up, she's almost too
easy.

¯¯¯ You get [Cosmic Egg #2] for
winning, and the Bomb Materials
Retrieval mission is now at an
end. Now return to the Red
Sprite.

- Horologium 1F

Go into Horologium and try to
ride the now-fixed elevator.
Skadi will destroy it and you
will have to fight her.

She has very little HP as well.
What's with these easy bosses?
Take her out with physicals, gun
skills, or Fire attacks. Just
make sure your Main Char is not
weak to Ice.

¯¯¯ You'll get the [Destiny
Jewel] rare Forma after the
battle. Take it back to the Red
Sprite's Lab to get the [Gate
Search D] function. Now head
back into Horologium.

Take the door east of the
entrance, and search for a
portal in this hall. Through it
is a dark area. Go west as far
as you can, north as far as you
can then south as far as you
can, then east two tiles and
north two tiles. Go through the
door.

Here, take the portal in the far
west to get into a new dark
area. In this one, go north all
the way, east all the way, north
all the way, east all the way,
then through the door. Ride the
elevator here.

B1F has a terminal past some
annoying ailment/damage fields,
but for now is also a dead end.
B4F has a heal point and some
damage/ailment fields, but for
now is also a dead end. Go down
to B2F to continue.

- Horologium B2F

Search for an obvious portal to
get things going here. It's a
linear area. No real puzzling
things must be done to traverse
it. Go west until you reach an
elevator and ride it down to
B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Go south into the poison fields,
then east, and when you get to
the fork, go south. In the
damage tiles, go east until you
reach a door and go through to
get [Summon Stone x1]. Then back
in the damage tile patch, go all
the way west and search for a
portal and go through it. Now
the path is clear to get to an
elevator. Go up to 1F.

- Horologium 1F

Search the wall to the southeast
to open up a shortcut to the
very entrance of Horologium.
Ignore the stairs as there's
only access to an EX Mission
from Barong by traversing all of
the C-type dark areas down
there, and you can't see in
C-type dark areas yet.

Go back into the elevator and
down to B3F.

- Horologium B3F

Go east and open the portal on
the wall. Go east until you
reach a fork, then turn and go
up the northwest path. Near the
end of this path, search the
south wall to find a portal.
Open it up and go through to get
[30000 Macca] and [Bead Chain
x1]. Leave the room via the only
door. Now go back to the central
part of this floor, and take the
south path this time. You will
reach a Heal Spot and terminal.
if you search the west wall 3
tiles above the terminal you can
find a portal. Go through it and
get [Soma x2] and [Great Chakra
x1].

Go east of the terminal and up
the stairs.

- Horologium B2F

Annoying, annoying floor full of
conveyors. Take them in the
following order if you want
[Chakra Pot x1]:

Southmost, west, east,
northwest, west, north, east,
east, east, then east four tiles
south of where that conveyors
ends up. Go north 3 tiles of
where this one ends up, then go
east to the wall. Go south two
tiles, then east to and ride the
next conveyor. Go south three
tiles, then east to the wall,
south to the wall, west one
tile, then south onto the
conveyor. When this one stops,
go two tiles west then step onto
the conveyor. Now, go east to
the wall, then south onto the
conveyor. When this one stops,
avoid all conveyors and find
your way to a treasure box. You
will get the Chakra Pot. You can
ride the next conveyor to get
back to the start of the floor.

Take them in the following order
to take a pitfall back to an
area of B3F you can't access
elsewhere and get [50000 Macca]
from:

Southmost, west, east,
northwest, west, north, east,
east, east, then east four tiles
south of where that conveyors
ends up. Go north 3 tiles of
where this one ends up, then go
east to the wall. Go south two
tiles, then east to and ride the
next conveyor. Go north and ride
the conveyor. When it stops,
search north for a portal and go
through. In here, search the
west wall for a portal and go
through it. You will ride a
conveyor into a pitfall to B3F.

In the west path here in this
room, you can find a box at the
end with the promised 50000
Macca. The south path from that
room leads back to a portal
which will open right near the
terminal on B3F and therefore
the stairs back up to B2F.

Take them in this order to
proceed in the dungeon:

Southmost, west, east,
northwest, west, north, east,
east, east, then east four tiles
south of where that conveyors
ends up. Go north 3 tiles of
where this one ends up, then go
east to the wall. Go south two
tiles, then east to and ride the
next conveyor. Go south three
tiles, then east to the wall,
south to the wall, west one
tile, then south onto the
conveyor. From here, go west and
ride the west conveyor. You can
now access a terminal and stairs
up to B1F.

- Horologium B1F

Very small area. Just loop
around and take the stairs down
to B2F.

- Horologium B2F

Literally all you can do in this
1 tile area is take the stairs
down.

- Horologium B3F

A very linear pathway. You can
find a terminal and a heal spot
near the stairs leading down to
B4F. Go down.

- Horologium B4F

Head past the D-type locked
door, and go east in the hallway
there. Go through the one-way
door on the north wall. This is
a big room with 6 doors, 3 on
the east, 3 on the west. Loiter
around the northwest-most door
until the Moon Phase reads 7/8
and is about to turn Full. Go
inside, and two tiles west to
teleport. If the moon phase is
NOT full yet, go north one til,
south one tile until it is full.
When it hits full, go south all
the way to teleport elsewhere.

In this room, unlock and go
through both the east and west
doors. Go through the west door
to continue. You will come
across a set of three doors
here. Go through the middle one,
then down the small hallway past
it to teleport again.

Go directly east and search for
a portal. This will unlock a
shortcut to this area, and you
can find a terminal and Heal
Spot beyond. Save, heal, then go
back west. You can find in this
area [Balm of Rising x2], an
elevator, and stairs down.

Use the elevator which leads to
1F. On 1F, you can unlock yet
another shortcut to Horologium's
very entrance. Go back down.
Save and heal, and get ready for
a boss battle. The best armor to
wear is the "Armor Vest" which
is Strong against Phys, Gun, and
Curse while weak against Elec.
The next boss uses Phys and Gun
primarily, with some Fire. Have
demons with the standard setup
of buffs/debuff like Luster
Candy, Debilitate and go down
the stairs.

Here are some passwords if
needed. They likely won't be
cheap.

- Horologium B5F

Attempt to go forward and a
scene will trigger with Jimenez.
You will now have to eliminate
Jimenez because, well, he let
the power go to his head and now
wants to kill you.

   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 9000 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Gun or Ice or Elec or Wi
* Random, may change each turn.

This fight can be won similarly
to the Zelenin fight.
Buffs/debuffs are king, but
again do not go past +3/-3 or
Jimenez will remove them.

Jimenez is serious business. If
you're not strong to Gun, he may
one shot you with his Chaos Tack
skill.

His regular attack hits all
targets.

Chaos Tack is a random target
Gun skill which is ludicrously
powerful. Those not strong or
better to Gun may be one shotted
by it before a lot of buffs and
debuffs are applied.

Hellfire is a strong fire spell
that hits all.

Left Hand is basically Luster
Candy. Remove with Dekaja or use
Debilitate to offset it by as
much as it adds.

Shuffler has a chance to inflict
Bomb status on everyone. Dis-
Bomb item or Bomdi or Salvation
spells will get rid of it.

Dark Matter is high almighty
damage to all. He will use it at
low HP or on the turn after if
you use a reflective spell or
item like Attack Mirror or
Makarakarn, etc. He'll also use
it every turn if you let him use
Left Hand all the way to +4, but
that shouldn't really ever
happen.

Basically buff up with Luster
Candy or Rakukaja and debuff him
with Tarunda or Debilitate, then
use physicals or
Gun/Ice/Elec/Wind spells and
hope you hit the weakness for
Demon Co-Ops. He shouldn't be
too hard, but if going for Co-
Ops then be aware that his
weakness can change at pretty
much any time.

¯¯¯ Scene after the fight, then
continue.

Go northwest and when you're as
far west as you can go, try to
walk out south onto
"nothingness" to reveal a hidden
path which leads to [Bead x2] in
a box. Then continue back north.
Yeah. A "new" dungeon element--
hidden paths. Some of them give
hints as to where you should
walk, while some don't.

When you reach an apparent dead
end in the center of the floor,
try to walk east in the middle
of the platform for a hidden
path. When you reach yet another
apparent dead end, go south. On
this path you can go east, to
another dead end. Go south, then
east, then south on the
nothingness to reach a platform
with some stairs leading up to
B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Search this small area of 4F to
acquire rare Forma [Gumonji
Mirror]. This can be taken back
to the Lab to get the [Enemy
Search C] Main App. With it, you
can now find even more types of
Hidden enemies and Fiends. Go
back down to B5F.

- Horologium B5F

At the dead end before the one
leading to the stairs, go north
then east to reveal more hidden
paths. Then north, east, and
north. One tile west, turn north
and you can reveal a hidden path
leading to a box with [Soma x2].
Back on the main path, head
west, north, west, north, west.

Here at the dead end path that
looks like the floor's entrance,
go south, then west, then north
to reach stairs down.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way through this
simple maze with the blocks that
pop up as you approach them. A
portal is accessible in the
southwest. Go through it.

Here, go west 2 tiles, south 3,
east 1, then south onto the
invisible walkway.

On it, go south, then west, then
south. Go all the way south, and
turn east when you can. Go 4
tiles east from when you turned
east, then turn north and go
north two. A Forma should appear
on your map. Loop around to the
north side of the forma then go
south to grab it. It's [Raven
Stone] and will turn into the
[Visualizer C] Main App that
lets you see in the yellow color
"Type C" dark areas. Go back to
the hidden gate opened earlier,
just past the maze area where
the red walls pop up.

From it, head one tile west,
then north and you'll step into
a hidden area. It's a maze of
sorts. Head north until you
teleport. Now, you'll have to
nagigate an annoying teleporter
maze here where all teleports
lead to the same area and you
want to avoid them all.

The solution to it is, from the
teleport's destination:

5 tiles west, 1 north, 1 west, 1
north, 2 west, 2 south, 1 east,
1 south, 1 east, 1 south, 1
east, 3 south, 2 west, 2 north,
and go through the elevator
door. Take it down to B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleport here in this
small area, and use it to reach
the east side of B9F. Ride the
elevator here back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Go all the way west and open the
portal and go through it. Go two
tiles north and search east to
find a portal, and go through
it. Follow this path to some
stairs down to B7F.

- Horologium B7F

Follow the small path here
through the door and hit the
switch at the end of the path.
Go back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Ride the elevator back down to
B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleporter in this
small area back to the west side
of B9F, and then ride the
elevator back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way, again, to the
gate near where the maze with
popping up red walls is. From
it, loop around to a D-type
locked door to the south and go
through it. Another red walls
popping up area here.

In the south is a terminal and
heal spot. Look for a portal on
the east wall to the northeast,
and go through it. Search for
yet another portal on the east
wall in this new hallway, and go
through.

To your east, you can find a box
with [Megidola Stone x1]. To the
far south is an elevator down,
while to the southwest, behind a
D-type locked door is a switch
to get rid of the red walls that
pop up. Hit the switch.

The elevator can be rode down to
B7F which is useless for now as
a portal opens from the other
side of the wall later, and to
1F where you can now open up a
shortcut to right near the
beginning of Horologium. Do what
you need then find the stairs
down next to the terminal here
on B6F and go down.

- Horologium B7F

Open the door to the north and
go through. Yeah, new type of
area. Invisible WALLS. This
makes it annoying to navigate.
Go north until you hit a wall,
then east until you hit a wall.
South then west from here is
[Sacrifice x1] in a box. Now go
back east, then north until you
hit a wall.

From here, west until you reach
a door on the north wall. Open
it, go through and hit the
switch then go back into the
room with invisible walls. Work
your way south and west and
you'll hit a space manipulation
device. Time to go to other
areas.

Phase Shift to type A. Work your
way around in this area to the
northwest and go through the
door. Follow this path until you
reach a switch. Hit it. Go back
and Phase Shift B at the device.
Work your way around the
northeast side of this room then
go south to get [Great Chakra
x1]. In the southeast end, go
through the door.

In the southeast end here, you
can open up a shortcut to the
elevator that connects with B6F
and 1F. To the north, a terminal
and heal spot. Just west of that
terminal, a portal you can open
to get [Bead of Life x1].

Go back and phase shift back to
the original space, then in the
room with the space manipulation
device, take the north exit.
Here, go all the way north and
you'll find some stairs down.
West of those stairs, a terminal
and heal spot. Use them if
needed, then head down.

If you can't get past the rock
in the middle of the hall to get
to the stairs it's because you
didn't hit all of the switches
on each side of the rock (west,
south, and east). You probably
missed the east one, which is
accessed from stairs down in the
northeast part of B6F.

- Horologium B8F

Literally head straight south
and go down the stairs. You can
deviate to pickup some forma if
you want, but this isn't a
complicated floor.

- Horologium B9F

Explore the northwest to find
[Sacrifice x1] and [Bead of Life
x1]. Explore the northeast to
find [Amrita Shower x2] and a
terminal and heal spot. This is
the final save point. Do all of
the EX Missions and gear and
forma grinding/level
grinding/fusion you need to.

West of the terminal is a
portal. Go through it. You are
now in the area of B9F you
accessed earlier and met Gore
in. Obviously, the big room
there houses Mem Aleph. Equip
your Main Character with the
Gibo Eyes Sub App if you happen
to have it, then go in when
ready.

You will want to create a party
of mixed alignments with
powerful attack and healing
skills.

If you want some premade demons
and are prepared to probably
farm up a lot of money, here is
a full varied alignment team
that will destroy the final boss
without much trouble.

  [ HP: 7300 / MP: 9999 ]
  > St: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse <

This is the final boss.

She has hit-all elemental
spells, Asura's "Asura Roga",
Ouroboros' ailment skill
"Disaster Cycle", "Mother's
Kiss" - a 6-8 hit physical
skill, and "Reason's Start"
which removes all buffs and
debuffs from both sides and then
heals her for around 600 HP.
Great Flood, which does damage
to all party members and lowers
your Agility battle statistic by
-1.

This boss is serious. You need
serious damage output and
healing skills to match it.
Buff/debuff spells aren't so hot
here because of Reason's Start.
You'll need to spam your demon's
strongest spells.

Jihad is a highly recommended
skill, though it comes only from
very high level demon's source.
High tier elemental and/or
almighty skills work too.

Make sure your MC is equipped
with the best armor you have,
preferably the Dragon Vest from
the Fafnir EX mission, and the
accessory that will revive you
once per battle should you die,
Dragon Ring. Keep your MC
healthy. At all times.

¯¯¯
When you win, another fight.

Same skills as last time, plus
two more. One is named Mem
Aleph, and it will return all
demons of a randomly chosen
alignment to your stock. This is
why you need a varied team in
alignment. Second is called
simply MA, and it will do an
amount of damage equal to the
target's current HP and heal Mem
Aleph by that amount. This is
primarily why you wear the
Dragon Ring. It will save you
from death from this once if you
are the target of it.

The changing resists is why you
equip the Gibo Eyes Sub App. It
lets you see what is ineffective
and by proxy, what is effective.

This fight is exactly like the
last one except for the addition
of new attacks on her part. She
just has more HP. Use the same
strategy and mind the target
cursor each turn for the resist
changes.

If Mem Aleph or MA is used,
revive/summon the demon back or
better yet if your demons have
the Sabbatma or Invitation
skills, use those to help get
the party back up and running.
Don't be afraid to use some
heavy restoration items, but
don't go crazy because they do
carry over to a second cycle.

¯¯¯ After you win, that's it.
The Neutral ending plays and
you're given a choice to save
your game to play through again
with bonuses while you keep many
of the things you've earned.

So you've chosen to side with
the God of Law and Order, YHVH,
Yahweh or whatever you wish to
call him, who apparently either
wishes to enslave humanity by
mind control or to create some
kind of hivemind that lives in
unity depending on how you see
what Mastema and the three wise
men are trying to do. Well,
Commander Gore doesn't like this
choice, so right away you have
to fight him!
   _________________
  < Boss: Meta Gore >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 15000 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Wind / Nu: Expel, Curse 

Gore is a beast. Fortunately, he
only uses Physical and Gun
attacks. He has a lot of HP, and
is weak to Wind. A team that is
Strong to Phys and/or Gun is
good. Here's his skill set...

Self-Denial -- Heals him for a
few hundred HP and has the same
effect as a cast of Tarukaja to
boot.

Charge -- Next physical does
more than two times as much
damage.

Heaven Strike -- Light, random,
multiple hits of physical
damage.

E.N.D. -- Random physical damage
plus chance for Fear status
ailment.

Adaptation -- Huge physical
damage strike. Seems to only use
it after using Charge and will
target the main character with
it every time. If you are not
Strong to Phys and not guarding,
you will die. I guarantee this.

"Gore is bursting with power!"
-- happens automatically once in
the fight and heals him for 7500
HP as well as clearing any
debuffs you've stacked onto him.

Rain Strike -- Heavy, random
target gun damage.

You'll want a team that can
attack with elemental attacks--
preferably Wind-- and has a good
number of the same old, same old
buffs and debuffs. Luster Candy
or Rakukaja on the buff side and
Debilitate or Tarunda/War Cry or
Dekaja on the debuff side.

Main Character should be
equipped with an armor that is
Strong to Phys and perhaps Gun
-- "Armor Vest" armor is ideal
as it is strong to both. A gun
that gives him a wind elemental
attack is nice, too, if you're
using same-alignment demons to
get Co-Op attacks.

Dekaja is needed to remove the
attack buff from Gore's Self-
Denial if you're not using
Debilitate, War Cry Tarunda to
lower his attack as you probably
should be.

You'll need to use Elemental or
Almighty attacks to damage him
since he reflects Phys and Gun.
Wind + Co-Ops is nice but you'd
probably have to make a whole
new custom team for exploiting
that setup.

This is just a long fight. You
should have plenty of Chakra
Drops however, and this is a
good place to spend them. Gore
will heal himself for 7500 HP
one or two times throughout this
battle, and Gore himself has the
highest HP of any boss in the
game save the ultimate optional
boss.

¯¯¯ Zelenin shows up and uses
her singing voice on the crew in
the scenes after the battle, and
a new Main Mission is added in
the following scenes. The Three
Wise Men will give you the rare
Forma [Clement Bell], as well.

• Mission: Find the Four Cosmic
  Eggs

Take the Clement Bell to the Lab
to get the [Unlock D] Main App.

Now it's time to collect those
Cosmic Eggs. You'll get a notice
about the elevator in Horologium
being broken when you go to the
deck, but that has nothing to do
with the mission for now. Head
into Antlia.

- Antlia

On 1F, go to the north end of
the floor and unlock the door
that opens to your new Unlock D
function. Very straight-forward
area. When you reach the C-type
dark areas (yellow), go through
the middle door and look for the
exit east, along the south wall.
Save at the terminal here, then
search the wall to the east for
a portal and go through.

You'll meet Wu Kong and have to
fight him.

Just use attacks that are not
Phys, Fire, Gun, Expel, or Curse
on him. Preferably Ice and Elec
for Demon Co-Ops if you'd like.
He doesn't have much HP. I
killed him in two turns with the
Elec shot from my gun and added
demon Co-Ops.

¯¯¯ You get [Cosmic Egg #1] for
winning. Leave Antlia now. Go to
Bootes.

- Bootes

Take the elevators in the palace
up to 6F. Open the door next to
you with the Unlock D function
and ride the elevator beyond it
up to 8F. Grab the [Soma x2] to
the south then go through the
door here. Take the door in the
southeast of this big room, then
go east to the terminal and
save. Go north of the terminal,
and down the stairs.

Search just south of you for a
portal, and go through.
Yatagarasu is here, and will
give you the the [Cosmic Egg #2]
without a fight. Now leave
Bootes, and go to Carina.

- Carina

Go up to 2F and phase shift over
to dimension B at the south
device. Work your way north and
go through the door unlocked
with the Unlock D App. Save your
game at the terminal here, then
search for a portal south of the
terminal. Go through.

You will meet and have to fight
Zhu Yin.

Simply fire away with Physicals
or non-gun attacks. He, like Wu
Kong, has very little HP and
should die in a few turns. Keep
your HP high though, as he knows
Megido spells. Buff and debuff
spells are worthless as Zhu Yin
knows Silent Prayer which
removes all buffs and debuffs on
both sides.

¯¯¯ After the fight, you acquire
[Cosmic Egg #3].

You can leave Carina now, or you
can explore the phase shift B
areas on 2F and 3F to pickup
some items -- [Great Chakra x1],
[Bead Chain x1], [Bead of Life
x1] and [Amrita Shower x2] and
THEN leave Carina!

Go to Delphinus next.

- Delphinus 1F

On 1F, you can now open the
locked door near Kudlak. More
conveyors. Ride the one of the
west two to the north, then go
east and search for a portal. Go
through and hit the switch, then
go back out and ride the
conveyor to your north. Follow
at the turn ahead, go straight
south until you stop, then go
west and ride the westmost
conveyor. When that conveyor
stops, search west for a portal
and go through it.

Now ride the conveyor north,
flip the switch to change the
directions of the conveyors back
to normal, and ride the conveyor
back south, going through the
secret door you just opened. Go
south down the conveyor, then
east past the next conveyor, and
after you turn going north, go
onto the first conveyor you
reach. Go south when that
conveyor stops.

You can now use an elevator and
open up a short back to the
beginning of the floor south of
the elevator. Take the elevator
up to 9F.

- Delphinus 9F

Search for a portal to the
southwest and go through it. In
this hallway, there are portals
to the west. One going north and
one south. Through the south,
[Great Chakra x1]. Through the
north, a path to a terminal.
West of the terminal, search the
south wall for a portal. Go
through.

You will meet Cherub here, and
it will give you [Cosmic Egg
#4]. Leave Delphinus afterwards,
to the Red Sprite.

The Main Mission "Find the Four
Cosmic Eggs" is now complete.

The next objective is to go into
Horologium for the final Exotic
Matter.

First, though, you may wish to
go into Grus and check the room
in the 1F phase shift Sanctum A
area where Mastema turned
Zelenin into an angel. There,
you'll meet an archangel who
will tell you about a ritual
that is going to be performed
and mark a spot on your map in
Horologium B6F.

- Horologium 1F

Go into Horologium and try to
ride the now-fixed elevator.
Surt will show up and destroy
it, and you will have to fight
him.

  < Boss: Tyrant Surt >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 1500 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Ice / Nu: Expel, Curse /

Surt has very little HP. He's
weak to Ice and Drains fire. He
can cast a fairly painful
Agidyne and his basic physical
attack hits twice, but really
unless your main character is
weak to Fire, there's no chance
of losing this fight. Honestly.
Just kill him with physical,
gun, or non-Fire magic.

¯¯¯ You'll get the [Destiny
Jewel] rare Forma after the
battle. Take it back to the Red
Sprite's Lab to get the [Gate
Search D] function. Now head
back into Horologium.

Take the door east of the
entrance, and search for a
portal in this hall. Through it
is a dark area. Go west as far
as you can, north as far as you
can then south as far as you
can, then east two tiles and
north two tiles. Go through the
door.

Here, take the portal in the far
west to get into a new dark
area. In this one, go north all
the way, east all the way, north
all the way, east all the way,
then through the door. Ride the
elevator here.

B1F has a terminal past some
annoying ailment/damage fields,
but for now is also a dead end.
B4F has a heal point and some
damage/ailment fields, but for
now is also a dead end. Go down
to B2F to continue.

- Horologium B2F

Search for an obvious portal to
get things going here. It's a
linear area. No real puzzling
things must be done to traverse
it. Go west until you reach an
elevator and ride it down to
B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Go south into the poison fields,
then east, and when you get to
the fork, go south. In the
damage tiles, go east until you
reach a door and go through to
get [Summon Stone x1]. Then back
in the damage tile patch, go all
the way west and search for a
portal and go through it. Now
the path is clear to get to an
elevator. Go up to 1F.

- Horologium 1F

Search the wall to the southeast
to open up a shortcut to the
very entrance of Horologium.
Ignore the stairs as there's
only access to an EX Mission
from Barong by traversing all of
the C-type dark areas down
there, and you can't see in
C-type dark areas yet.

Go back into the elevator and
down to B3F.

- Horologium B3F

Go east and open the portal on
the wall. Go east until you
reach a fork, then turn and go
up the northwest path. Near the
end of this path, search the
south wall to find a portal.
Open it up and go through to get
[30000 Macca] and [Bead Chain
x1]. Leave the room via the only
door. Now go back to the central
part of this floor, and take the
south path this time. You will
reach a Heal Spot and terminal.
if you search the west wall 3
tiles above the terminal you can
find a portal. Go through it and
get [Soma x2] and [Great Chakra
x1].

Go east of the terminal and up
the stairs.

- Horologium B2F

Annoying, annoying floor full of
conveyors. Take them in the
following order if you want
[Chakra Pot x1]:

Southmost, west, east,
northwest, west, north, east,
east, east, then east four tiles
south of where that conveyors
ends up. Go north 3 tiles of
where this one ends up, then go
east to the wall. Go south two
tiles, then east to and ride the
next conveyor. Go south three
tiles, then east to the wall,
south to the wall, west one
tile, then south onto the
conveyor. When this one stops,
go two tiles west then step onto
the conveyor. Now, go east to
the wall, then south onto the
conveyor. When this one stops,
avoid all conveyors and find
your way to a treasure box. You
will get the Chakra Pot. You can
ride the next conveyor to get
back to the start of the floor.

Take them in the following order
to take a pitfall back to an
area of B3F you can't access
elsewhere and get [50000 Macca]
from:

Southmost, west, east,
northwest, west, north, east,
east, east, then east four tiles
south of where that conveyors
ends up. Go north 3 tiles of
where this one ends up, then go
east to the wall. Go south two
tiles, then east to and ride the
next conveyor. Go north and ride
the conveyor. When it stops,
search north for a portal and go
through. In here, search the
west wall for a portal and go
through it. You will ride a
conveyor into a pitfall to B3F.

In the west path here in this
room, you can find a box at the
end with the promised 50000
Macca. The south path from that
room leads back to a portal
which will open right near the
terminal on B3F and therefore
the stairs back up to B2F.

Take them in this order to
proceed in the dungeon:

Southmost, west, east,
northwest, west, north, east,
east, east, then east four tiles
south of where that conveyors
ends up. Go north 3 tiles of
where this one ends up, then go
east to the wall. Go south two
tiles, then east to and ride the
next conveyor. Go south three
tiles, then east to the wall,
south to the wall, west one
tile, then south onto the
conveyor. From here, go west and
ride the west conveyor. You can
now access a terminal and stairs
up to B1F.

- Horologium B1F

Very small area. Just loop
around and take the stairs down
to B2F.

- Horologium B2F

Literally all you can do in this
1 tile area is take the stairs
down.

- Horologium B3F

A very linear pathway. You can
find a terminal and a heal spot
near the stairs leading down to
B4F. Go down.

- Horologium B4F

Head past the D-type locked
door, and go east in the hallway
there. Go through the one-way
door on the north wall. This is
a big room with 6 doors, 3 on
the east, 3 on the west. Loiter
around the northwest-most door
until the Moon Phase reads 7/8
and is about to turn Full. Go
inside, and two tiles west to
teleport. If the moon phase is
NOT full yet, go north one til,
south one tile until it is full.
When it hits full, go south all
the way to teleport elsewhere.

In this room, unlock and go
through both the east and west
doors. Go through the west door
to continue. You will come
across a set of three doors
here. Go through the middle one,
then down the small hallway past
it to teleport again.

Go directly east and search for
a portal. This will unlock a
shortcut to this area, and you
can find a terminal and Heal
Spot beyond. Save, heal, then go
back west. You can find in this
area [Balm of Rising x2], an
elevator, and stairs down.

Use the elevator which leads to
1F. On 1F, you can unlock yet
another shortcut to Horologium's
very entrance. Go back down.
Save and heal, and get ready for
a boss battle. The best armor to
wear is the "Armor Vest" which
is Strong against Phys, Gun, and
Curse while weak against Elec.
The next boss uses Phys and Gun
primarily, with some Fire. Have
demons with the standard setup
of buffs/debuff like Luster
Candy, Debilitate and go down
the stairs.

Here are some password demons if
needed. It likely won't be
cheap.

- Horologium B5F

Attempt to go forward and a
scene will trigger with Jimenez.
You will now have to eliminate
Jimenez because, well, he let
the power go to his head and now
wants to kill you.

Jimenez is serious business. If
you're not strong to Gun, he may
one shot you with his Chaos Tack
skill.

You'll want to use the standard
buff/debuff strategy and keep in
mind not to go past -3 and +3.

His regular attack hits all
targets.

Chaos Tack is a random target
Gun skill which is ludicrously
powerful. Those not strong or
better to Gun may be one shotted
by it before a lot of buffs and
debuffs are applied.

Hellfire is a strong fire spell
that hits all.

Left Hand is basically Luster
Candy. Remove with Dekaja or use
Debilitate to offset it by as
much as it adds.

Shuffler has a chance to inflict
Bomb status on everyone. Dis-
Bomb item or Bomdi or Salvation
spells will get rid of it.

Dark Matter is high almighty
damage to all. He will use it at
low HP or on the turn after if
you use a reflective spell or
item like Attack Mirror or
Makarakarn, etc. He'll also use
it every turn if you let him use
Left Hand all the way to +4, but
that shouldn't really ever
happen.

Basically buff up with Luster
Candy or Rakukaja and debuff him
with Tarunda or Debilitate, then
use physicals or Ice spells for
Co-Ops. If he starts to Drain
the Ice spells later in the
battle, just use whatever
Physical or Almighty or
basically anything he doesn't
Null/Drain to finish him off. He
shouldn't be too hard.

¯¯¯ Scene after the fight, then
continue.

Go northwest and when you're as
far west as you can go, try to
walk out south onto
"nothingness" to reveal a hidden
path which leads to [Bead x2] in
a box. Then continue back north.
Yeah. A "new" dungeon element--
hidden paths. Some of them give
hints as to where you should
walk, while some don't.

When you reach an apparent dead
end in the center of the floor,
try to walk east in the middle
of the platform for a hidden
path. When you reach yet another
apparent dead end, go south. On
this path you can go east, to
another dead end. Go south, then
east, then south on the
nothingness to reach a platform
with some stairs leading up to
B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Search this small area of 4F to
acquire rare Forma [Gumonji
Mirror]. This can be taken back
to the Lab to get the [Enemy
Search C] Main App. With it, you
can now find even more types of
Hidden enemies and Fiends. Go
back down to B5F.

- Horologium B5F

At the dead end before the one
leading to the stairs, go north
then east to reveal more hidden
paths. Then north, east, and
north. One tile west, turn north
and you can reveal a hidden path
leading to a box with [Soma x2].
Back on the main path, head
west, north, west, north, west.

Here at the dead end path that
looks like the floor's entrance,
go south, then west, then north
to reach stairs down.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way through this
simple maze with the blocks that
pop up as you approach them. A
portal is accessible in the
southwest. Go through it.

Here, go west 2 tiles, south 3,
east 1, then south onto the
invisible walkway.

On it, go south, then west, then
south. Go all the way south, and
turn east when you can. Go 4
tiles east from when you turned
east, then turn north and go
north two. A Forma should appear
on your map. Loop around to the
north side of the forma then go
south to grab it. It's [Raven
Stone] and will turn into the
[Visualizer C] Main App that
lets you see in the yellow color
"Type C" dark areas. Go back to
the hidden gate opened earlier,
just past the maze area where
the red walls pop up.

From it, head one tile west,
then north and you'll step into
a hidden area. It's a maze of
sorts. Head north until you
teleport. Now, you'll have to
nagigate an annoying teleporter
maze here where all teleports
lead to the same area and you
want to avoid them all.

The solution to it is, from the
teleport's destination:

5 tiles west, 1 north, 1 west, 1
north, 2 west, 2 south, 1 east,
1 south, 1 east, 1 south, 1
east, 3 south, 2 west, 2 north,
and go through the elevator
door. Take it down to B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleport here in this
small area, and use it to reach
the east side of B9F. Ride the
elevator here back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

From here, you can get to the
marked spot from earlier and
begin the Law exclusive EX
Mission by talking to the Cherub
at that spot. When the angels
all merge into Seraph, accept
his request.

• EX Mission: Evil's lingering
  shadow

Go all the way west and open the
portal and go through it. Go two
tiles north and search east to
find a portal, and go through
it. Follow this path to some
stairs down to B7F.

- Horologium B7F

Follow the small path here
through the door and hit the
switch at the end of the path.
Go back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Ride the elevator back down to
B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleporter in this
small area back to the west side
of B9F, and then ride the
elevator back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way, again, to the
gate near where the maze with
popping up red walls is. From
it, loop around to a D-type
locked door to the south and go
through it. Another red walls
popping up area here.

In the south is a terminal and
heal spot. Look for a portal on
the east wall to the northeast,
and go through it. Search for
yet another portal on the east
wall in this new hallway, and go
through.

To your east, you can find a box
with [Megidola Stone x1]. To the
far south is an elevator down,
while to the southwest, behind a
D-type locked door is a switch
to get rid of the red walls that
pop up. Hit the switch.

The elevator can be rode down to
B7F which is useless for now as
a portal opens from the other
side of the wall later, and to
1F where you can now open up a
shortcut to right near the
beginning of Horologium. Do what
you need then find the stairs
down next to the terminal here
on B6F and go down.

- Horologium B7F

Open the door to the north and
go through. Yeah, new type of
area. Invisible WALLS. This
makes it annoying to navigate.
Go north until you hit a wall,
then east until you hit a wall.
South then west from here is
[Sacrifice x1] in a box. Now go
back east, then north until you
hit a wall.

From here, west until you reach
a door on the north wall. Open
it, go through and hit the
switch then go back into the
room with invisible walls. Work
your way south and west and
you'll hit a space manipulation
device. Time to go to other
areas.

Phase Shift to type A. Work your
way around in this area to the
northwest and go through the
door. Follow this path until you
reach a switch. Hit it. Go back
and Phase Shift B at the device.
Work your way around the
northeast side of this room then
go south to get [Great Chakra
x1]. In the southeast end, go
through the door.

In the southeast end here, you
can open up a shortcut to the
elevator that connects with B6F
and 1F. To the north, a terminal
and heal spot. Just west of that
terminal, a portal you can open
to get [Bead of Life x1].

Go back and phase shift back to
the original space, then in the
room with the space manipulation
device, take the north exit.
Here, go all the way north and
you'll find some stairs down.
West of those stairs, a terminal
and heal spot. Use them if
needed, then head down.

If you can't get past the rock
in the middle of the hall to get
to the stairs it's because you
didn't hit all of the switches
on each side of the rock (west,
south, and east). You probably
missed the east one, which is
accessed from stairs down in the
northeast part of B6F.

- Horologium B8F

Literally head straight south
and go down the stairs. You can
deviate to pickup some forma if
you want, but this isn't a
complicated floor.

- Horologium B9F

Explore the northwest to find
[Sacrifice x1] and [Bead of Life
x1]. Explore the northeast to
find [Amrita Shower x2] and a
terminal and heal spot. This is
the final save point. Do all of
the EX Missions and gear and
forma grinding/level
grinding/fusion you need to.

West of the terminal is a
portal. Go through it. You are
now in the area of B9F you
accessed earlier and met Gore
in. Obviously, the big room
there houses Mem Aleph. Equip
your Main Character with the
Gibo Eyes Sub App if you happen
to have it, then go in when
ready.

You will want to create a party
of mixed alignments with
powerful attack and healing
skills.

If you want some premade demons
and are prepared to probably
farm up a lot of money, here is
a full varied alignment team
that will destroy the final boss
without much trouble.

This is the final boss.

She has hit-all elemental
spells, Asura's "Asura Roga",
Ouroboros' ailment skill
"Disaster Cycle", "Mother's
Kiss" - a 6-8 hit physical
skill, and "Reason's Start"
which removes all buffs and
debuffs from both sides and then
heals her for around 600 HP.
Great Flood, which does damage
to all party members and lowers
your Agility battle statistic by
-1.

This boss is serious. You need
serious damage output and
healing skills to match it.
Buff/debuff spells aren't so hot
here because of Reason's Start.
You'll need to spam your demon's
strongest spells.

Jihad is a highly recommended
skill, though it comes only from
very high level demon's source.
High tier elemental and/or
almighty skills work too.

Make sure your MC is equipped
with the best armor you have,
preferably the Dragon Vest from
the Fafnir EX mission, and the
accessory that will revive you
once per battle should you die,
Dragon Ring. Keep your MC
healthy. At all times.

¯¯¯
When you win, another fight.

Same skills as last time, plus
two more. One is named Mem
Aleph, and it will return all
demons of a randomly chosen
alignment to your stock. This is
why you need a varied team in
alignment. Second is called
simply MA, and it will do an
amount of damage equal to the
target's current HP and heal Mem
Aleph by that amount. This is
primarily why you wear the
Dragon Ring. It will save you
from death from this once if you
are the target of it.

The changing resists is why you
equip the Gibo Eyes Sub App. It
lets you see what is ineffective
and by proxy, what is effective.

This fight is exactly like the
last one except for the addition
of new attacks on her part. She
just has more HP. Use the same
strategy and mind the target
cursor each turn for the resist
changes.

If Mem Aleph or MA is used,
revive/summon the demon back or
better yet if your demons have
the Sabbatma or Invitation
skills, use those to help get
the party back up and running.
Don't be afraid to use some
heavy restoration items, but
don't go crazy because they do
carry over to a second cycle.

¯¯¯ After you win, that's it.
The Law ending plays and you're
given a choice to save your game
to play through again with
bonuses while you keep many of
the things you've earned.

So you've chosen to side with
the demons and their vision of a
more primal world as things
supposedly used to be, with
themselves, many of them old
gods at the helm. Gore doesn't
like this and decides you must
die.
   _________________
  < Boss: Meta Gore >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 15000 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Wind / Nu: Expel, Curse 

Gore is a beast. Fortunately, he
only uses Physical and Gun
attacks. He has a lot of HP, and
is weak to wind. A team that is
Strong to Phys and/or Gun is
good. Here's his skill set...

Self-Denial -- Heals him for a
few hundred HP and has the same
effect as a cast of Tarukaja to
boot.

Charge -- Next physical does
more than two times as much
damage.

Heaven Strike -- Light, random,
multiple hits of physical
damage.

E.N.D. -- Random physical damage
plus chance for Fear status
ailment.

Adaptation -- Huge physical
damage strike. Seems to only use
it after using Charge and will
target the main character with
it every time. If you are not
Strong to Phys and not guarding,
you will die. I guarantee this.

"Gore is bursting with power!"
-- happens automatically once in
the fight and heals him for 7500
HP as well as clearing any
debuffs you've stacked onto him.

Rain Strike -- Heavy, random
target gun damage.

You'll want a team that can
attack with elemental attacks--
preferably Wind-- and has a good
number of the same old, same old
buffs and debuffs. Luster Candy
or Rakukaja on the buff side and
Debilitate or Tarunda/War Cry or
Dekaja on the debuff side. You
could try without them, but
well, he hits very hard if he
isn't debuffed.

Main Character should be
equipped with an armor that is
Strong to Phys and perhaps Gun
-- "Armor Vest" armor is ideal
as it is strong to both. A gun
that gives him a wind elemental
attack is nice, too, if you're
using same-alignment demons to
get Co-Op attacks.

Dekaja is needed to remove the
attack buff from Gore's Self-
Denial if you're not using
Debilitate, War Cry Tarunda to
lower his attack as you probably
should be.

You'll need to use Elemental or
Almighty attacks to damage him
since he reflects Phys and Gun.
Wind + Co-Ops is nice but you'd
probably have to make a whole
new custom team for exploiting
that setup.

This is just a long fight. You
should have plenty of Chakra
Drops however, and this is a
good place to spend them. Gore
will heal himself for 7500 HP
one or two times throughout this
battle, and Gore himself has the
highest HP of any boss in the
game save the ultimate optional
boss.

¯¯¯ After the fight, scenes will
play with Jimenez. The main
mission objectives of
Horologium's Exotic Matter will
be updated. You will now need to
go talk to Mem Aleph in B9F of
Horologium. You'll notice all of
the crewmembers have kinda gone
bonkers, too. Save and heal up.

If you head into Grus now, you
can talk to Grendel who will
tell you go to where Maya was.
If you do, you will meet Mara.
Mara will give you the Chaos
exclusive EX Mission. If you
killed Grendel earlier, just go
straigh to where Maya was to
meet Mara.

• EX Mission: Mara's desire

Get that if you wish, then head
into Horologium.

- Horologium 1F

Head to the elevator and go down
to B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Enter the room in the back and
talk to Mem Aleph. A new main
mission will be added.

• Mission: Find the Four Cosmic
  Eggs

She will also give you the rare
Forma [Clement Bell]. Leave
Horologium after the scene.

Go to the Lab to have the
Clement Bell turned into [Unlock
D] Main App.

You will now need to go Antlia,
Bootes, Carina, and Delphinus to
progress.

First stop, Antlia.

- Antlia

On 1F, go to the north end of
the floor and unlock the door
that opens to your new Unlock D
function. Very straight-forward
area. When you reach the C-type
dark areas (yellow), go through
the middle door and look for the
exit east, along the south wall.
Save at the terminal here, then
search the wall to the east for
a portal and go through.

Wu Kong will be here and will
simply give you [Cosmic Egg #1].
Leave Antlia and go to Bootes.

- Bootes

Take the elevators in the palace
up to 6F. Open the door next to
you with the Unlock D function
and ride the elevator beyond it
up to 8F. Grab the [Soma x2] to
the south then go through the
door here. Take the door in the
southeast of this big room, then
go east to the terminal and
save. Go north of the terminal,
and down the stairs.

Search just south of you for a
portal, and go through. The
missing ship, the Gigantic is
before you. Yatagarasu shows up
and you'll have to fight it.
   ___________________________
  < Boss: Avian Yatagarasu x3 >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 1000 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Gun, Ice / Nu: Expel, Cu

You could probably win this one
with auto-battle if it weren't
for their annoying "Ally Call"
ability. All they'll do is boost
their agility with Sukukaja and
then cast Maragidyne. Dekaja
them if you find yourself
missing too much.

Spread your damage out on them
equally and try to kill them
within one to two rounds of each
other, otherwise the last one
will use Ally Call and then two
more Yatagarasu with full health
will show up. They have about
1000 HP a piece, to gauge how
much you should do to each one
before firing off a nice hit-all
finisher.

¯¯¯¯ Winning gets you [Cosmic
Egg #2]. Leave Bootes
afterwards, and go to Carina.

- Carina

Go up to 2F and phase shift over
to dimension B at the south
device. Work your way north and
go through the door unlocked
with the Unlock D App. Save your
game at the terminal here, then
search for a portal south of the
terminal. Go through. You will
meet Zhu Yin here.

He will give you [Cosmic Egg #3]
without a fight, just like Wu
Kong did.

You can leave Carina now, or you
can explore the phase shift B
areas on 2F and 3F to pickup
some items -- [Great Chakra x1],
[Bead Chain x1], [Bead of Life
x1] and [Amrita Shower x2] and
THEN leave Carina!

Enter Delphinus next.

- Delphinus 1F

On 1F, you can now open the
locked door near Kudlak. More
conveyors. Ride the one of the
west two to the north, then go
east and search for a portal. Go
through and hit the switch, then
go back out and ride the
conveyor to your north. Follow
at the turn ahead, go straight
south until you stop, then go
west and ride the westmost
conveyor. When that conveyor
stops, search west for a portal
and go through it.

Now ride the conveyor north,
flip the switch to change the
directions of the conveyors back
to normal, and ride the conveyor
back south, going through the
secret door you just opened. Go
south down the conveyor, then
east past the next conveyor, and
after you turn going north, go
onto the first conveyor you
reach. Go south when that
conveyor stops.

You can now use an elevator and
open up a short back to the
beginning of the floor south of
the elevator. Take the elevator
up to 9F.

- Delphinus 9F

Search for a portal to the
southwest and go through it. In
this hallway, there are portals
to the west. One going north and
one south. Through the south,
[Great Chakra x1]. Through the
north, a path to a terminal.
West of the terminal, search the
south wall for a portal. Go
through.

You will meet and have to fight
Divine Cherub.

  < Boss: Divine Cherub >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 1200 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Elec / Nu: Expel, Curse 

Another LOW hp "boss." Use Elec
attacks for max efficiency with
Co-Ops, or just physical/gun
attribute skills. You'll win in
like 3 rounds tops. He does know
Megidola and Mahamaon, though by
wearing most armors, the Hama
skills can't touch you.

¯¯¯ You get [Cosmic Egg #4].
Jimenez will comm you and tell
you to go visit Mem Aleph again.
Leave Delphinus, and go back to
Horologium.

- Horologium 1F

Equip yourself to be strong to
or to null both Expel and Curse.
Go into Horologium and try to
ride the elevator down to B9F.
Israfel will show up and destroy
it, and you will then have to
fight him.
   ______________________
  < Boss: Herald Israfel >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 1500 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Fire / Nu: Ice, Expel, C

He has very little HP as well.
What's with these easy bosses?
You can take Israfel out with
physicals or Fire or whatever
you want. He has only about 1500
HP. The problem is that he uses
Horn of Fate and that can
instantly kill you if you aren't
protected against Expel and
Curse.

Aside from this, he also knows
Luster Candy and Diarahan, so
make sure that your damage
output isn't weak or you may
have trouble killing him as he
just heals himself up to full
over and over.

¯¯¯ You'll get the [Destiny
Jewel] rare Forma after the
battle. Take it back to the Red
Sprite's Lab to get the [Gate
Search D] function. Now head
back into Horologium.

Take the door east of the
entrance, and search for a
portal in this hall. Through it
is a dark area. Go west as far
as you can, north as far as you
can then south as far as you
can, then east two tiles and
north two tiles. Go through the
door.

Here, take the portal in the far
west to get into a new dark
area. In this one, go north all
the way, east all the way, north
all the way, east all the way,
then through the door. Ride the
elevator here.

B1F has a terminal past some
annoying ailment/damage fields,
but for now is also a dead end.
B4F has a heal point and some
damage/ailment fields, but for
now is also a dead end. Go down
to B2F to continue.

- Horologium B2F

Search for an obvious portal to
get things going here. It's a
linear area. No real puzzling
things must be done to traverse
it. Go west until you reach an
elevator and ride it down to
B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Go south into the poison fields,
then east, and when you get to
the fork, go south. In the
damage tiles, go east until you
reach a door and go through to
get [Summon Stone x1]. Then back
in the damage tile patch, go all
the way west and search for a
portal and go through it. Now
the path is clear to get to an
elevator. Go up to 1F.

- Horologium 1F

Search the wall to the southeast
to open up a shortcut to the
very entrance of Horologium.
Ignore the stairs as there's
only access to an EX Mission
from Barong by traversing all of
the C-type dark areas down
there, and you can't see in
C-type dark areas yet.

Go back into the elevator and
down to B3F.

- Horologium B3F

Go east and open the portal on
the wall. Go east until you
reach a fork, then turn and go
up the northwest path. Near the
end of this path, search the
south wall to find a portal.
Open it up and go through to get
[30000 Macca] and [Bead Chain
x1]. Leave the room via the only
door. Now go back to the central
part of this floor, and take the
south path this time. You will
reach a Heal Spot and terminal.
if you search the west wall 3
tiles above the terminal you can
find a portal. Go through it and
get [Soma x2] and [Great Chakra
x1].

Go east of the terminal and up
the stairs.

- Horologium B2F

Annoying, annoying floor full of
conveyors. Take them in the
following order if you want
[Chakra Pot x1]:

Southmost, west, east,
northwest, west, north, east,
east, east, then east four tiles
south of where that conveyors
ends up. Go north 3 tiles of
where this one ends up, then go
east to the wall. Go south two
tiles, then east to and ride the
next conveyor. Go south three
tiles, then east to the wall,
south to the wall, west one
tile, then south onto the
conveyor. When this one stops,
go two tiles west then step onto
the conveyor. Now, go east to
the wall, then south onto the
conveyor. When this one stops,
avoid all conveyors and find
your way to a treasure box. You
will get the Chakra Pot. You can
ride the next conveyor to get
back to the start of the floor.

Take them in the following order
to take a pitfall back to an
area of B3F you can't access
elsewhere and get [50000 Macca]
from:

Southmost, west, east,
northwest, west, north, east,
east, east, then east four tiles
south of where that conveyors
ends up. Go north 3 tiles of
where this one ends up, then go
east to the wall. Go south two
tiles, then east to and ride the
next conveyor. Go north and ride
the conveyor. When it stops,
search north for a portal and go
through. In here, search the
west wall for a portal and go
through it. You will ride a
conveyor into a pitfall to B3F.

In the west path here in this
room, you can find a box at the
end with the promised 50000
Macca. The south path from that
room leads back to a portal
which will open right near the
terminal on B3F and therefore
the stairs back up to B2F.

Take them in this order to
proceed in the dungeon:

Southmost, west, east,
northwest, west, north, east,
east, east, then east four tiles
south of where that conveyors
ends up. Go north 3 tiles of
where this one ends up, then go
east to the wall. Go south two
tiles, then east to and ride the
next conveyor. Go south three
tiles, then east to the wall,
south to the wall, west one
tile, then south onto the
conveyor. From here, go west and
ride the west conveyor. You can
now access a terminal and stairs
up to B1F.

- Horologium B1F

Very small area. Just loop
around and take the stairs down
to B2F.

- Horologium B2F

Literally all you can do in this
1 tile area is take the stairs
down.

- Horologium B3F

A very linear pathway. You can
find a terminal and a heal spot
near the stairs leading down to
B4F. Go down.

- Horologium B4F

Head past the D-type locked
door, and go east in the hallway
there. Go through the one-way
door on the north wall. This is
a big room with 6 doors, 3 on
the east, 3 on the west. Loiter
around the northwest-most door
until the Moon Phase reads 7/8
and is about to turn Full. Go
inside, and two tiles west to
teleport. If the moon phase is
NOT full yet, go north one til,
south one tile until it is full.
When it hits full, go south all
the way to teleport elsewhere.

In this room, unlock and go
through both the east and west
doors. Go through the west door
to continue. You will come
across a set of three doors
here. Go through the middle one,
then down the small hallway past
it to teleport again.

Go directly east and search for
a portal. This will unlock a
shortcut to this area, and you
can find a terminal and Heal
Spot beyond. Save, heal, then go
back west. You can find in this
area [Balm of Rising x2], an
elevator, and stairs down.

Use the elevator which leads to
1F. On 1F, you can unlock yet
another shortcut to Horologium's
very entrance. Go back down.
Save and heal, and get ready for
a boss battle. The best armor to
wear is the "Life Vest" which is
Strong against Wind while weak
to Ice. The next boss uses Expel
and Wind attacks. Have demons
with the standard setup of
buffs/debuff like Luster Candy,
Debilitate etc. as well as good
physicals or Fire attacks if you
can get them as well, then go
down the stairs to B5F.

Here's some demons if you need
them, of course.

¯¯¯
- Horologium B5F

Attempt to go forward and a
scene will trigger with Mastema.
He's kinda pissed at you, but
for different reasons than you'd
think an angel would be. You
have to fight him.
   ______________________
  < Boss: Herald Mastema >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 8500 / MP: 9999 ]
  > Wk: Fire / Nu: Expel, Curse 

Mastema attacks with Wind,
Expel, Almighty, and charm
attacks primarily.

Great Lament attempts to charm
every party member.

Judgement attempts to Expel
instant-kill all party members.

Untainted Wind does Wind damage
to all party members.

Mel Faize does almighty damage
to all party members.

In addition, he has a regular
attack that hits all party
members.

He's a big pushover should you
use the conventional buff up
with Luster Candy and debuff him
with Tarunda or Debilitate
method and then chop away with
physicals or Fire attacks+Co-
Ops. Again, do not go above the
magical +3/-3 buff/debuff sweet
spot because of Dekaja/Dekunda.

The only thing you need to watch
out for if using the buff method
to defeat Mastema is early in
the fight that Great Lament may
charm your party members. Remedy
this with Dis-Charm or Salvation
spell from your demon(s).

Honestly this guy is so, so easy
compared to who you fight here
on the Law and Neutral paths.
He's all talk.

¯¯¯
• Herald Mastema fusion is
  unlocked.

Enjoy the fan-servicey scene
between Mastema and everyone's
favorite fallen angel, you-know-
who. Then continue on.

Go northwest and when you're as
far west as you can go, try to
walk out south onto
"nothingness" to reveal a hidden
path which leads to [Bead x2] in
a box. Then continue back north.
Yeah. A "new" dungeon element--
hidden paths. Some of them give
hints as to where you should
walk, while some don't.

When you reach an apparent dead
end in the center of the floor,
try to walk east in the middle
of the platform for a hidden
path. When you reach yet another
apparent dead end, go south. On
this path you can go east, to
another dead end. Go south, then
east, then south on the
nothingness to reach a platform
with some stairs leading up to
B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Search this small area of 4F to
acquire rare Forma [Gumonji
Mirror]. This can be taken back
to the Lab to get the [Enemy
Search C] Main App. With it, you
can now find even more types of
Hidden enemies and Fiends. Go
back down to B5F.

- Horologium B5F

At the dead end before the one
leading to the stairs, go north
then east to reveal more hidden
paths. Then north, east, and
north. One tile west, turn north
and you can reveal a hidden path
leading to a box with [Soma x2].
Back on the main path, head
west, north, west, north, west.

Here at the dead end path that
looks like the floor's entrance,
go south, then west, then north
to reach stairs down.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way through this
simple maze with the blocks that
pop up as you approach them. A
portal is accessible in the
southwest. Go through it.

Here, go west 2 tiles, south 3,
east 1, then south onto the
invisible walkway.

On it, go south, then west, then
south. Go all the way south, and
turn east when you can. Go 4
tiles east from when you turned
east, then turn north and go
north two. A Forma should appear
on your map. Loop around to the
north side of the forma then go
south to grab it. It's [Raven
Stone] and will turn into the
[Visualizer C] Main App that
lets you see in the yellow color
"Type C" dark areas. Go back to
the hidden gate opened earlier,
just past the maze area where
the red walls pop up.

From it, head one tile west,
then north and you'll step into
a hidden area. It's a maze of
sorts. Head north until you
teleport. Now, you'll have to
nagigate an annoying teleporter
maze here where all teleports
lead to the same area and you
want to avoid them all.

The solution to it is, from the
teleport's destination:

5 tiles west, 1 north, 1 west, 1
north, 2 west, 2 south, 1 east,
1 south, 1 east, 1 south, 1
east, 3 south, 2 west, 2 north,
and go through the elevator
door. Take it down to B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleport here in this
small area, and use it to reach
the east side of B9F. Ride the
elevator here back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

If you have the Mara's desire EX
Mission, you can find the marked
spot in this area. However it
may be a good idea to confront
Seraph after you open the rest
of 6F later on after you press
the switch to get rid of the
Magma and access the
terminal/heal spot. Anyway, to
continue...

Go all the way west and open the
portal and go through it. Go two
tiles north and search east to
find a portal, and go through
it. Follow this path to some
stairs down to B7F.

- Horologium B7F

Follow the small path here
through the door and hit the
switch at the end of the path.
Go back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Ride the elevator back down to
B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleporter in this
small area back to the west side
of B9F, and then ride the
elevator back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way, again, to the
gate near where the maze with
popping up red walls is. From
it, loop around to a D-type
locked door to the south and go
through it. Another red walls
popping up area here.

In the south is a terminal and
heal spot. Look for a portal on
the east wall to the northeast,
and go through it. Search for
yet another portal on the east
wall in this new hallway, and go
through.

To your east, you can find a box
with [Megidola Stone x1]. To the
far south is an elevator down,
while to the southwest, behind a
D-type locked door is a switch
to get rid of the red walls that
pop up. Hit the switch.

The elevator can be rode down to
B7F which is useless for now as
a portal opens from the other
side of the wall later, and to
1F where you can now open up a
shortcut to right near the
beginning of Horologium. Do what
you need then find the stairs
down next to the terminal here
on B6F and go down.

- Horologium B7F

Open the door to the north and
go through. Yeah, new type of
area. Invisible WALLS. This
makes it annoying to navigate.
Go north until you hit a wall,
then east until you hit a wall.
South then west from here is
[Sacrifice x1] in a box. Now go
back east, then north until you
hit a wall.

From here, west until you reach
a door on the north wall. Open
it, go through and hit the
switch then go back into the
room with invisible walls. Work
your way south and west and
you'll hit a space manipulation
device. Time to go to other
areas.

Phase Shift to type A. Work your
way around in this area to the
northwest and go through the
door. Follow this path until you
reach a switch. Hit it. Go back
and Phase Shift B at the device.
Work your way around the
northeast side of this room then
go south to get [Great Chakra
x1]. In the southeast end, go
through the door.

In the southeast end here, you
can open up a shortcut to the
elevator that connects with B6F
and 1F. To the north, a terminal
and heal spot. Just west of that
terminal, a portal you can open
to get [Bead of Life x1].

Go back and phase shift back to
the original space, then in the
room with the space manipulation
device, take the north exit.
Here, go all the way north and
you'll find some stairs down.
West of those stairs, a terminal
and heal spot. Use them if
needed, then head down.

If you can't get past the rock
in the middle of the hall to get
to the stairs it's because you
didn't hit all of the switches
on each side of the rock (west,
south, and east). You probably
missed the east one, which is
accessed from stairs down in the
northeast part of B6F.

- Horologium B8F

Literally head straight south
and go down the stairs. You can
deviate to pickup some forma if
you want, but this isn't a
complicated floor.

- Horologium B9F

Explore the northwest to find
[Sacrifice x1] and [Bead of Life
x1]. Explore the northeast to
find [Amrita Shower x2] and a
terminal and heal spot. This is
the final save point of
Horologium, but you won't have
to fight the final boss here.

West of the terminal is a
portal. Go through it. You are
now in the area of B9F you
accessed earlier and met Gore
in. Obviously, the big room
there houses Mem Aleph. Go
inside and talk to her.

The main mission Find the Four
Cosmic Eggs is now complete. Mem
Aleph will give you [EM:
Horologium] and a new main
mission will be added...

• Mission: Reach the Vanishing
  Point

The next thing to do is leave
Horologium and head for
Eridanus.

- Eridanus

I'm sure you know where you need
to go. Head up to the TOP floor
and save your game. Equip an
armor that is not weak to Expel
or Curse. Preferably the very
powerful Dragon Vest or Mesotes
Vests, neither of which have a
weakness and both of which are
very high Def power. In
addition, equip the main
character with the "Dragon Ring"
accessory.

If you want some premade demons
and are prepared to probably
farm up a lot of money, here is
a full Chaos team that will
destroy the final boss without
much trouble, using Phys
attacks.

¯¯¯ Head into the Vanishing

Ouroboros much earlier in the
game, and the main mission Reach
the Vanishing Point concludes.
However, you will have someone
to fight.
   ______________________
  < Boss: Pillar Zelenin >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 10000 / MP: 9999 ]
  > St: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse /

Zelenin is the final boss of the
Chaos path.

Her attacks are as follows:

Wave of Death -- a powerful hit-
all Physical attack.

Megido Storm -- a powerful hit-
all Elec spell.

Right Hand -- Basically Luster
Candy. Counter with Dekaja or
offset with Debilitate or Jihad.

Requiem -- Instant kill that can
pierce both Tetraja AND Expel
and Curse null, but won't have a
high chance of hitting if
buff/debuffs are properly done.
Targets all party members.

Sinner's Song -- almighty damage
plus possible charm to all.

Plus her regular attack hits
all, as well.

Much like many previous bosses,
you'll want to buff up here to
begin, preferably with Luster
Candy and then debuff Zelenin
with what you can -- preferably
with either Debilitate or by
using the endgame attack skill
Jihad which basically huge
almighty damage + Debilitate in
one. Again, try not to go above
+3/-3 buff status. Though with
Jihad, you really can't help it
on the debuff side but don't
worry as you'll simply reapply
those stat debuffs while using
it on her.

With buffs/debuffs up, Zelenin
is very managable and you should
only have trouble when she uses
Requiem or Sinner's Song, both
of which will have very low
success rates in killing or
charming you when the buffs and
debuffs are active. The most
important debuff in this fight
is to her agility, rather than
to her attack power. But
Debilitate and Jihad have all
debuffs in one, so why not use
them if you've got them?

Attack her using Physical,
Almighty or anything other than
Elec. After using Requiem, she
becomes weak to Physical for
several rounds. That's when you
can spam Co-Ops on her for extra
damage via physicals, or just
bust out with high end physical
skills.

The Dragon Ring will save you
from Requiem once should it hit
you, though it has a very low
chance to assuming you've buffed
up and debuffed properly.

Be high 70s or higher with
demons of similar levels and
this fight should not really be
a problem for you to win.

¯¯¯ After you win, that's it.
The Chaos ending plays and
you're given a choice to save
your game to play through again
with bonuses while you keep many
of the things you've earned.

- Grus 1F

This section is for New Game+/
second cycle players only. On
your first play, an angel says
"This is not the time to open
this to man, God will tell me
when it is" or some such. This
is basically navigational
directions to get through the
whole second half of Grus
accessible from Phase Shift
Sanctum A only on a New
Game+/second cycle.

First you'll need to do
"Marebito, the foreign god" EX
Mission for the Gate Search E
Main App. With the Gate Search E
Main App, you need to have
gotten the [Cornucopia] rare
Forma discussed earlier in the
first Grus section of the
walkthrough-- it's in Grus 1F
original, non-phase shifted area
if you do not have it. Look for
a gate search portal in the
northwest part of that floor
near the Strike Team corpse.

Cornucopia becomes the Unlock E
Main App. With the Unlock E Main
App, you can now go to that door
in Grus Phase Shift A, which
leads to the east side of Grus
B1F via some stairs going down.
You'll pickup a new EX Mission
doing that as well from the
suspicious Strike Team member in
front of the previously
impassable door.

• EX Mission: The mother
  goddess' gravestone

Beyond the door you will find
stairs down to B1F. The "Red
Carpet" Sub App is a real big
help since this is just a
nightmare to navigate and having
0 random encounters will save
you a headache when navigating
this mess.

- Grus B1F

This is a small area with no
real branching paths. Head down
the stairs to the east of where
you entered.

- Grus B2F

Another area, this time you'll
find a terminal in the center
and two stairs to take. The
northwest stairs leads up to B1F
where you can grab [Sacrifice
x1] and pitfall back down into
the area you were just in. Take
the southeast stairs afterwards
back up to B1F.

- Grus B1F

Its teleports or pitfalls
depending on which path you take
here. Take the east one to
begin, as the rest are pitfalls
to previously visited places.
Now take the south path. Then
the west. Follow the small path
around in here to teleport--
there's no option on where to
go. Move forward again to
teleport, as you are on another
small path.

You'll now be in a larger area
with actual choices. In it, at
the fork here, turn north and go
straight north as far as you can
to teleport. Another four way
area, three pits and one
teleport. Head north in it to
teleport! Once at the
destination, head east to
teleport. All you'll be able to
do now is navigate this small
area until you fall down a
pitfall to B2F.

- Grus B2F

Another large yet devoid of much
area. There's a terminal, and
northeast of it, stairs up. Go
up.

- Grus B1F

Go north at the fork here, as
the south will just cause a need
for back tracking, and you don't
want that. At the north side of
these hallways, you will find a
teleport. After the teleport,
you're in more 4-way areas with
only one teleporter and 3 pits.
Go south to teleport. From here,
take the west teleport. Now,
take the north one. Loop around
in this small area to teleport.

Here, go straight north until
you hit a teleport. Go east
until you teleport now. You'll
only be able to follow a small
path into a pitfall from here.

- Grus B2F

All you'll find here is stairs.
But first, unlock the hidden
gate portal to the southeast of
those stairs, then go down them.

- Grus B3F

One way doors. Joy. This one's
more annoying though, you have
to use the phase shift and
screwing up means huge amounts
of backtracking to get back and
try again.

First, let's get a treasure! Go
west two doors, south one, east
three, then north one. Grab the
box with [Sacrifice x1], then go
west a door. You are back at the
entrance again.

From the start here, go west
three doors. Use the phase
shifter and shift over to
Sanctum A. Go one door south,
and search the east wall here
for a secret door. Go through,
and from here, go east, east,
south, west, south. Search for a
secret portal on the east and
open it up for later, then go
west, then north. Take the
stairs up.

- Grus B2F

Nothing to do but go up the
stairs to the north here.

- Grus B1F

Straight north of this entrance
to B1F, you can find stairs up.
To the east and west of those
stairs are doors with small
rooms containing these items:
[Summon Stone x1] and [Great
Chakra x1].

South of the stairs going back
down that you came from (avoid
trying to go into 1 tile
corridors to the east, west and
far south as they are pitfalls
and backtracking sucks and all
that) you can find, along the
east and west walls, secret
portals to small rooms that
contain items. You need Gate
Search D to open these however,
so if you come here early before
Horologium you kinda can't get
these items. They are: [Lu
Incense x1] and [Amrita Soda
x2].

You'll want go up the stairs in
the north up to 1F when you've
got your items from these boxes.

- Grus 1F

Save and heal here before you
even think of going into the
room to your south. A Strike
Team member gives a sort of
friendly reminder if you step up
to the door. It looks a lot like
Maya's room's entrance, doesn't
it? Well, there's a reason why.
Behind the door...
   ____________________
  < Boss: Geist Alilat >
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  [ HP: 3500 / MP: 9999 ]
  > St: Phys / Nu: Gun, Expel, C

One of the optional New Game+
bosses. Only elemental and
almighty are going to do you any
good here against Alilat. Alilat
herself only has four actions. A
regular attack, Megidolaon,
Concentrate, and Diarahan. Yes,
Diarahan. A full freaking heal.
She only has about 3500 HP,
though.

You'll want to begin the fight
concentrating on buffs and
debuffs. Luster Candy and
Debilitate or Jihad or other
real powerful spells. The
Megidolaon may hurt so I
recommend spamming Mediarahan or
Salvation with one demon pretty
much every round, or using a
Bead Chain if you end a round
with too little HP.

At +3/-3 buff status, the
Megidolaon shouldn't hurt too
much unless Alilat uses
Concentrate, in which case you
may want to guard if your HPs
aren't dangerously low and you'd
need to prioritize healing.

The way to win this fight is
basically to slam her with very
high level demons with Jihad,
Big Bang, Megidolaon or Element
+ Amp spells. There really isn't
much strategy involved. If
you've got high enough level
demons with Jihad, you can
probably end this fight in a
couple rounds of spamming it.
You'll certainly need such
demons for the next EX Mission.

¯¯¯
• Geist Alilat fusion is
  unlocked.

You'll be treated to a scene
afterwards where the EX Mission
"The mother goddess' gravestone"
concludes and be given the rare
Forma [Nabatea Stone]. If you
agree to help what appears to be
Metatron afterwards, you'll get
yet another new EX Mission.

• EX Mission: False god in
  chains

Whew. Well, it's time to get
cracking on working our way down
to B4F of this dungeon. That
means going back down through
the floors... Start by heading
down to B1F from the stairs
here.

- Grus B1F

Go east of the stairs down to
B2F which are to the south to
fall down a pit.

- Grus B2F

Hey! You know where you are.
Right next to the stairs down to
B3F. That's good. Go down them.

- Grus B3F

Go west three doors and phase
shift over to Sanctum B. All you
can do now is go west and up the
stairs.

- Grus B2F

Now a boring part. You need to
do some backtracking. Open up
the portal here in this small
room, then go up the stairs to
the southwest. From here, you'll
have to tread already covered
area by stepping on teleports
and falling down pits to get to
the northeast stairs down to B3F
once again. You've already
covered this ground, so I
shouldn't need to explain how to
do it once again. Just follow
the teleporters. Once you get to
those stairs, go down them.

- Grus B3F

Yeah, all that backtracking just
to get back over to this side...
annoying. Time to go through
some one-way doors in a specific
order.

Take doors in the following
order: West, west, south, west,
west, south, east, south. Search
the east wall to open a secret
portal, and go through it. From
here, take the doors north,
east, north, north, west, west.
You'll be at the space
manipulation device again. Set
it to the original space now. Go
west through the door, and up
the stairs.

- Grus B2F

More annoying backtracking...
but this time things have to be
done differently in order to
reach a new destination. Go out
the door and take the stairs up
to B1F.

- Grus B1F

Yeah, you'll have to take more
teleports back to traversed
areas. But you'll need to drop
down a specific pit this time.
Anyway, from this location, go
north until you teleport. Go
north again and teleport. Go
east and teleport. Loop around
and drop down the pit.

- Grus B2F

Go up the stairs beyond the
terminal.

- Grus B1F

Take the teleport to the north.
At the teleport destination, go
south to teleport. Now go west
to teleport. From here, fall
down the pit to either the south
or the east.

- Grus B2F

Almost done getting to B4F
here... from here, you can
access stairs down. First,
though, unlock the hidden portal
to the southeast of those
stairs. Now go down the stairs.

- Grus B3F

This is the southeast B3F east
entrance. Due to the unlocked
secret portals from before, it
is now possible to progress on
this floor. Go west three doors,
north one, then west two.
Consider this spot right here a
hub. It has a phase shifter, but
to get to the next boss via the
elevator you do not need to use
it.

From here, if you go north one
door you can access the
elevator. Take it down... if you
dare!... Ok, you won't be in
imminent danger just from going
down. If you want to go down, go
ahead. You won't be able to do
anything down there except
save/heal unless you have the
Enemy Search C Main App.

If you want treasure, well,
that's different story. First, I
hope you like a lot of
backtracking. You know what I
told you to consider a hub
above? Well, from it, set the
Phase Shift to A. Now, go south,
grab the [Vi Incense x1], go
east and up the stairs.

On B2F, find the hidden portal
to the west and go through it.
Here's the cool fun part.
Backtrack your way to the
southeast entrance to B3F. Nope,
not kidding. Have fun. There
yet? Good. From it, go west
three doors, north one, west
one. Grab the [Megidola Stone
x1] here. Now all you can do is
go south and up the stairs.

If you wish to get back down to
B4F's elevator, well, first you
need to backtrack to the
northeast entrance to B3F and
reset the phase shifter back to
the original, then you need to
backtrack to the southeast
entrance to B3F and you can
finally make your way back to
that elevator. Was that treasure
really worth it? Probably not.

That's when you can continue to
the end of this crazy bonus
dungeon by going down the
elevator.

- Grus B4F

Just ahead you can find a
terminal and heal spot. To do
what you need to do down here
(fight the big badass and
complete the EX Mission) you
require the Enemy Search C App
from Horologium. If you don't
have it yet, leave since you
can't do anything here. If you
do have it however, go north
past the terminal and heal spot
and in the northmost room,
choose to scan when the game
prompts you to.

Actually, don't. Not without
being prepared. Really prepared.
How prepared? Level 99 prepared.
With very good demons. These are
mine. They're, well, really
expensive. If you max out the
analyze gauge on your own
versions of these first, you can
save yourself some serious
dough.

¯¯¯ In addition, the Solomon
Ring accessory is a good choice,
along with the Absolute Vest
armor and the Peacemaker, Megido
Fire or Meteor Dragoon guns. You
will also need a number of
quality restorative items. Bead
Chains, Great Chakras, Beads of
Life. Yeah, you should have
enough to get you through this
fight unless you played the game
really underleveled twice and
spent them on scraping by
bosses. You won't need too many
if you use my custom demons, as
they have a beastly high Ma
stat.

Who is this ultimate boss? The
one thought to be the creator
god of our world in gnosticism.
Known by names such as as
Ialdabaoth, or "the demiurge".
Go on in and scan to begin the
fight.

Yes... serious business here.
Very serious business indeed.

Demiurge is by far the strongest
boss in the game. This is why I
suggest the powerful demons,
level 99 and good equipment for
an easy time. You can only
reliably damage him with
Almighty attacks. He effectively
reflects and nulls all of the
rest of them regularly to the
point where you'd have to build
a team that covers all elements
on most demons for any kind of
efficiency approaching just
spamming the same one or two
Almighty attacks. Sad, but true.

The strategy is basically to
buff up with Luster Candy to +3
and spam Jihad, while using
restoratives on your main
character. Begin by using a
Tetraja Stone on your main
character to prevent any
instant-kills via Mahamaon or
Mamudoon and if he uses one of
those spells, use another
Tetraja Stone. In any case, your
main character isn't going to
cause any kind of significant
damage here unless you did the
Mysterious device to farm
Incense via the boss rush to up
him to 99 all stats or
something. That isn't needed,
though.

As an alternative to Jihad you
could also Debilitate him to -3
and then use Big Bang or other
almighty skills like Babylon
Goblet, Megidolaon, etc. Big
Bang only costs 10 less MP than
Jihad and the only benefit
you'll see is that he deals less
damage to you on the turns that
he does attack due to the
constant -3 to his attack.

Even if you did max your MC's
stats out, he can't compare to
Jihad-using 90+ Ma demons. Use
him to throw items to heal the
party and replenish party MP.

Demiurge will spend many of his
turns using Dekunda with the
Jihad strategy, to remove
Jihad's debuffs. He'll spend a
few using Diarama which heals
him for 900-1200, and your
damage output with my password
demons will be insane, should
you choose to use them. You
should only need 1 or 2 Great
Chakras or Beads of Life to beat
him into submission if you use
those demons.

If using lesser demons with 60s,
70s or otherwise below 80 Ma, it
will take you much longer to
defeat him. Much, much longer.
And you'll need more items to
heal with, too. Anyway, spam him
down with almighty and items,
that's basically all there is to
it. The hardest part is of
course getting a party capable
of doing it. A decent amount of
grinding is needed. Nowhere near
as much as say, Digital Devil
Saga ultimate bosses, but still
quite a bit.

His attacks include Big Bang,
Mamudoon, Mahamaon, Agi Gate,
Bufu Gate, Zio Gate, Garu Gate,
Luster Candy, Dekunda, and that
Disaster Cycle attack that was
first seen on Ouroboros and then
reused on a few other bosses.
But really, you'll probably
never even see half of them if
you're Jihad spamming him.

¯¯¯
• Vile Demiurge fusion is
  unlocked.

You'll get the choice to either
watch the fusion or to stop it.

> What will you do?
• Watch the fusion
• Seal it away

Do whatever you wish. The
outcome for you, as the player,
is the same. You get your
reward. Unless you're Law
aligned, anyway. If you're Law
aligned and "Watch the fusion,"
well...

> Make Demiurge an ally?
• Yes
• No

Free Demiurge for you.

If you don't choose to allow the
fusion to take place, you will
get your Chakra Elixir from the
female voice that kept telling
you to stay the hell away from
here instead of from the
Demiurge.

   _____________________________
> Main Character's Gun Skills <
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Despite many of the main
character's gun skills such as
"Gust Shot" for example which is
a Wind attribute attack being a
magic property, all of the main
character's Gun skills are
affected in power by one thing:

The Main Character's Gun Attack
Power stat. This is only
increased by...

• A higher Attack Power gun.
• His St (Strength) stat.

Ma does not factor into the
damage calculations at all. It
is due to this that the Power
value of a skill is not all you
should consider when picking a
Gun to do damage using its
skills. Unless you are using a
Gun's skills to trigger Co-Ops
via weakness exploitation, you
are almost universally better
off using the highest Attack
Power gun with desired skills
that you can get your hands on.

That aside, here's a list of all
of the gun skills, sorted by
attribute type.

This is a listing of the enemy
data displayed in the Demon Data
-> Demon Analysis menu in the
game.

This is NOT a listing of the
stats of every demon you can get
in the game. Basically, these
are the demons as you encounter
them in random encounters, and
many demons are fusion only or
special encounters that don't
show up on this list at all.

The stats and skills of these
demons differ from when you
recruit them. Enemies marked
with a "*" next to their
personality cannot be negotiated
with. They are Enemy Search-only
demons.

It's sorted by the default "By
Race" sorting the game uses.
