This FAQ is meant to serve as a translation and gameplay guide for Treasure and
Sega's Bleach DS: Souten ni Kakeru Unmei. It follows a rough outline of the
game's instruction manual with more in-depth information for items that
non-Japanese players would find most useful (such as detailed information
regarding the card system and Story/Challenge Mode walkthroughs).

This guide will not include either a story translation or detailed character
strategy. The former is because I have very limited Japanese skills and have
had no exposure to Bleach prior to this game. The latter is because I do not
intend to learn the ins-and-outs of every single character.

This document is encoded in Japanese Shift-JIS format. In order to properly
display Japanese characters in your browser, you must set its character
encoding to Shift-JIS. In Internet Explorer and Firefox, this should be located
somewhere in the View menu. If you cannot find a selection for Japanese
Shift-JIS, you may have to download a language pack.

If you believe you can supply any additional useful information or if you find
a mistake in this document that needs to be corrected, feel free to e-mail me.

- TOP SCREEN -

SOUL (ç∞ÈÆ) GAUGE
This is the blue life bar at the top of the screen.

REIATSU (óÏà≥) GAUGE
Can be roughly translated as "spirit pressure." This is the green bar beneath
your life gauge, which fills up as you attack your enemy and increases your
reiatsu stock count by 1 when filled.

REIATSU (óÏà≥) STOCK
This is the number located next to your life gauge. You can hold up to 3
reiatsu stock in reserves, which are required to perform super moves and damage
cancels.

REIFU (óÏïÑ) EFFECT
Reifu are the spirit cards used during battle to power-up your character or
power-down your opponents. A colored icon will appear beneath your life gauge
when your character is currently under the effect of a card. This color
indicates the type of effect, which matches the color of the card used. For
more information on reifu and their effects, see the reifu section below.

REIRYOKU (óÏóÕ) GAUGE
Can be roughly translated as "spirit power." This is the three-segmented bar at
the bottom of the screen, which fills up automatically over time. Reiryoku is
required to perform RF specials, use flash steps, and jump between the two
planes of battle. Using flash steps and switching planes depletes the inner
gauge only, while using RF specials depletes both the inner and outer gauges.
The inner gauge restores itself more quickly than the outer gauge, but the
inner gauge will only restore itself as long as the outer gauge is at an equal
or greater level. In other words, the inner gauge can never be larger than the
outer gauge.

TIME LIMIT
Located on the bottom-right corner of the screen.

- TOUCH SCREEN -

REIFU (óÏïÑ) STOCK
Large number that indicates how many reifu you have left in reserves.

CHANGE BUTTON
Pressing this button changes the display layout on the touch screen. You can
choose to either have only two large reifu buttons on the screen, or two
smaller reifu buttons accompanied by hotkeys for special techniques.

REIFU (óÏïÑ) BUTTONS
These are the spirit cards, which are activated upon touch. Ten of these cards
are randomly selected from a preset deck and shuffled. Two of them will be
available for use at any one time.
 CARD EFFECT: The large Japanese text on the card indicates its effect. Check
              the reifu section below for an explanation of each card.
 CARD TARGET: This indicates who will be effected by the card, either your
              character (myself), all enemies, a single enemy, or all players.
 CARD LEVEL: This indicates the strength of that particular card. Most reifu
             have four levels of strength, level 1 being the weakest.
 CARD TIMER: Depending on the type of card, this indicates either how long the
             reifu effect will last or how long a used reifu card will continue
             to use up space on your screen before being replaced by a fresh
             one.

SPECIAL HOTKEYS
Press the change button to toggle these on and off. Blue hotkeys are shortcuts
for specials and will always use the reinforce (RF) version of the attack when
possible, next-strongest version if not. Red hotkeys are shortcuts for supers. 

Ñ°------------Ñ¢
Ñ† PAUSE MENU Ñ†
Ñ§------------Ñ£
Press start during gameplay to bring up the pause menu. Press start again to
return to gameplay.

COMMAND LIST: brings up a list of your characters' specials/supers
CPU ACTION (TRAINING): forces the CPU character to perform selected action
CPU GUARD (TRAINING): instructs the CPU to guard against you when possible
DISPLAY (CHALLENGE): changes the command display method
CHARACTER SELECT (VS/TRAINING/CHALLENGE): returns to character select screen
EXIT: returns to main menu

Ñ°-----------------------------Ñ¢
Ñ† VICTORY & DEFEAT CONDITIONS Ñ†
Ñ§-----------------------------Ñ£
You can select from either DEATHMATCH or POINTMATCH in most versus setups. In
Deathmatch, gameplay stops when your life bar empties, and the last player or
team with any life remaining wins. In Pointmatch, you receive 1 point for every
hit point of damage you inflict on the enemy and lose 1 point for every hit
point you lose. Point matches are always timed, and the player or team with the
most points at the end of the battle wins.

- MOVEMENT -

WALK & TURN: left/right
JUMP:        up
CROUCH:      down
DASH:        left/right twice; 2nd press can be held down
AERIAL DASH: left/right twice in mid-air
DOUBLE JUMP: up while in mid-air
FLASH STEP:  B button (can be changed in options, uses 1/3 of reiryoku gauge)
LINE CHANGE: L button (can be changed in options, uses 1/3 of reiryoku gauge)

Movement in Bleach DS takes place on two individual 2D fighting planes (with
the exception of Area 10, which only has one plane). Attacks performed on one
plane will not interfere with the action on the other plane, save for a handful
of special moves which either launch a projectile into the opposite plane or
teleport your character between planes. You can switch planes at any time by
pressing the line change button, which uses up one segment of your inner
reiryoku gauge.

Flash steps are used to quickly teleport in any direction, and most characters
are invulnerable and invisible to opponents when they perform this technique.
You can use flash steps to teleport through or away from enemy attacks, travel
a longer distance quickly, link normal attacks that normally do not chain
together, or position yourself in the air for a quick overhead attack. Flash
steps also use up one segment of your inner reiryoku gauge.

A walking state can be canceled into a dashing state, which can then be
canceled into an attacking state. You can not change between these states in
the opposite order (without the use of a flash step). Up to one double jump and
two aerial dashes can be performed before returning to the ground. These aerial
movement techniques can be linked together in any manner. Walking speed,
dashing speed, and flash step distance vary between individual characters.

- DEFENSE -

GUARD:         R button (can be changed in options)
GUARD CANCEL:  flash step / special while guarding (uses reiryoku)
DAMAGE CANCEL: any attack button + flash step when enemy strikes (uses reiatsu)

Guarding nullifies damage from enemy attacks and also prevents you from being
staggered. Most special moves still inflict a small amount of chip damage to
guarding opponents, however. A standing guard blocks standing and aerial
attacks but is vulnerable to crouching attacks and throws. A crouching guard
blocks standing and crouching attacks but is vulnerable to aerial attacks and
throws. An aerial guard blocks all attacks. Guarding can either be performed
with the guard button or by moving in the opposite direction of an enemy
attack.

In a normal guarding state, you can not perform any action besides
standing/crouching. When an enemy attack hits your character while you are
guarding, however, a small blue circle will quickly appear, expand, and vanish.
While this circle is visible, you can perform either a flash step or a
special/super attack while you are guarding. This technique is called a guard
cancel, and it uses up one segment of your inner reiryoku gauge.

A damage cancel can be performed to break free from normal enemy attacks,
special moves, and stuns. To perform this technique, simultaneously press the
flash step button plus any normal attack button while your character is being
attacked. (Using a reifu while in a damaged state also performs a damage
cancel.)  The aura that surrounds your character during a damage cancel will
inflict 1 hit point of damage to any enemy character that it touches. Damage
canceling requires 1 reiatsu stock to perform and cannot be used against super
moves.

- OFFENSE -

LIGHT ATTACK:       Y button (can be changed in options)
MEDIUM ATTACK:      X button (can be changed in options)
HEAVY ATTACK:       A button (can be changed in options)
THROW:              left/right + medium/heavy attack, standing next to enemy
SPECIALS/SUPERS:    varies between characters; check command list / use hotkeys
REINFORCE SPECIALS: strongest variation of special attacks, always executed
                    with strong attack button, usually depletes 1/3 of reiryoku
                    gauge and abbreviated with "RF"

All characters besides Bonnie have three different levels of normal attacks
(light, medium, and heavy), which have their own dedicated buttons and can be
chained together in various ways. The behavior of normal attacks changes
depending on whether your character is in a standing, crouching, or aerial
state. If a normal attack hits your opponent, you can immediately follow it up
with a stronger attack to perform what is called a chain combo. An example of a
simple chain combo is: light attack -> medium attack -> heavy attack. For most
characters, you cannot follow a medium or heavy attack with an attack of equal
or lesser strength; you usually have to either perform a stronger normal
attack, flash step, or special/super move to keep your combo going.

Throws can be performed when standing next to an opponent. They normally don't
cause much damage, but they will often put your opponent into a flying or
stunned state, which can be useful for setting up additional attacks. Throws
cannot be performed in mid-air. If you walk or flash step out of range of an
opponent at the very same moment he attempts to throw you, the throw will fail
and the enemy character will briefly enter a tripping/kneeling animation. If
you strike an opponent at the same moment he attempts to throw you, or if both
characters attempt to throw each other at the same time, they will both be
knocked back from each other.

Each character has a variety of unique special moves and super moves, which can
either be performed by specific button combinations (listed in the pause menu)
or by using the touch screen hotkeys. Blue hotkeys are for specials, and red
hotkeys are for supers.

Like normal attacks, many special moves vary in strength, speed, and behavior
depending on which attack button you use. Specials performed with the light
attack button are usually quick but have a long recovery time. Those performed
with the medium attack button are usually slow but have a quick recovery time.
Those performed with the heavy attack button often combine the best of both
worlds. The strongest of these three variations is called a reinforced (RF)
special move. Performing RF specials uses up one segment of your outer reiryoku
gauge. If your reiryoku gauge is empty, attempting to perform an RF special
will result in the use of the next-strongest variation of that special instead.
Using the touch screen to perform specials will have the same function as using
the heavy attack button, which means that you'll always use the RF version with
the touch screen if it's available.

Super moves are typically the strongest attacks available to your character,
and they do not vary in strength depending on which attack button you press to
perform them. Every super in the game requires either 1 or 3 reiatsu stock to
perform.

- MISCELLANEOUS -

KYORAKU/UKITAKE TEAM SUPER
Kyoraku and Ukitake each have a super attack that is only available if both of
them are present and on the same team during battle.

YACHIRU/NEMU STUN GLITCH
Yachiru and Nemu are not affected by attacks at all when in a stunned state.
All attacks travel right through them and cause no damage. There is no delay
when recovering from the stun, either. Holding down guard as they recover from
a stun will prevent them from being damaged by any attacks that happen to hit
them as the stun wears off.

Ñ† REIFU (óÏïÑ) Ñ†
Ñ§--------------Ñ£
Reifu are the spirit cards used during battle to power-up your character and
power-down your opponents. Various level 1 cards are earned through Story Mode,
level 4 cards through Arcade and Challenge Modes, some through password entry,
and the remainder in Urahara's shop. You can arrange up to 5 decks of 15 cards
each in Deck Construction mode. 10 cards from your chosen deck will be randomly
selected and arranged for use during gameplay.

You can usually obtain up to 4 copies of each level 1 card, 3 of each level 2,
2 of each level 3, and 1 of each level 4. Some cards only have one level. You
do not have to re-buy cards after use; your stock will be fully replenished
after each battle for later use.

Below is a data chart for all the various reifu available in the game, sorted
in the same order as most of the in-game menus. Each data box follows this
format:

+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|     óÏïÑ         REIFU   | explanation of card effect                       |
|      ñº          NAME    | timer                 | how to earn level 4 card |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

The timer indicates the difference between the level 1/2/3/4 versions of each
card and can be of any one of the following types:
 instantaneous: card's effect is instant and will be immediately replaced
                after use
      duration: card's effect lasts over a certain period of time
        linger: card's effect is instant, but the card will remain onscreen for
                a set time before being replaced

You'll notice that the timer for a few cards do not either increase or decrease
consistently between levels. This is usually because the higher level version
has a more potent effect rather than a simple difference in duration. (For
example, I believe that the higher level versions of Reiatsu Capture will steal
a greater amount of reiatsu stock from the opponent than the lower level
versions would.)

The bottom-right corner of each data box indicates what must be completed to
obtain the level 4 version of the card. As an alternative to Arcade and
Challenge Mode, you can also buy the level 4 cards after purchasing ALL the
level 1-3 cards from the shop. The level 4 versions cost quite a lot at 200000
apiece, though. It's recommended to earn them through gameplay if it's not too
difficult for you.

Ñ† SIMPLE MODE (ä»à’ëÄçÏÉÇÅ[Éh) Ñ†
Ñ§------------------------------Ñ£
When setting up the game, there will be an option to change the control method
from Manual to Auto. Auto activates Simple Mode, which has the following
features:

AUTOMATIC CHAIN COMBO
This feature strings attacks together whenever possible. For an example of how
this works, start Training Mode with Ichigo in Manual mode. Walk up next to
your opponent and quickly press the light attack button 3 times in succession.
You will strike him with 3 light attacks. Now return to the Character Select
screen and change the control method to Auto. Walk up to your opponent and
quickly press the light attack button 3 times once more. Ichigo will use the
light attack -> medium attack -> heavy attack chain combo instead. Auto chain
combo will attempt to use the most damaging variation of your command when you
are guaranteed to hit the enemy. Be aware, however, that this limits the number
of custom combos you can discover and execute on your own. Auto chain combo
isn't recommended for advanced players or anybody who wants to be truly
competitive.

AUTOMATIC GUARD
This feature will cause your character to automatically guard whenever
possible. Only your opponents' counter attacks will successfully connect.

SPECIAL HOTKEYS
When in Simple Mode, the hotkeys for specials and supers will be displayed by
default. You can still use the change button to show only the reifu cards.

Ñ°---------------------------------------------------------------------------Ñ¢

NOTE: Ichigo and Renji cannot use their bankai supers in their respective story
episodes until they reach the point where they learn how to perform them in the
manga/anime. Ganju cannot summon Bonnie in his episode because he's apparently
searching for her.

You must complete Ichigo's story before you are allowed to play anyone else's.
Ichigo's story has many branching paths with certain conditions that must be
met in order to successfully complete it. The story dialogue will give you
hints as to what is required of you (usually with bright red text), but it's
all for nothing if you can't read Japanese. Below is a walkthrough with all the
requirements for successfully completing Ichigo's story. I'm not sure if it's
the most effective route, but I can verify that it works.

Training:                complete the instruction sequence
vs Ganju:                defeat him
vs Renji:                defeat him 
vs Kenpachi:             defeat him
vs Byakuya:              defeat him
vs Renji:                defeat him with 0 reiatsu stock remaining
vs Hinamori:             defeat her
vs Hitsugaya & Hinamori: defeat them
vs Kurotsuchi:           defeat him
vs Renji:                defeat him with 0 reiatsu stock remaining
vs Hitsugaya & Hinamori: defeat Hitsugaya first, Hinamori second
vs Ichimaru:             defeat him
vs Renji:                defeat him with 3 reiatsu stock remaining
vs Kyoraku & Ukitake:    defeat them
vs Tosen:                defeat him
vs Tosen & Komamura:     defeat them
vs Renji:                defeat him with 3 reiatsu stock remaining
vs Kyoraku & Ukitake:    execute a 20-hit combo (hit both at once with Super B)
vs Soifon:               defeat her
vs Genryusai:            defeat him
Advanced Training:       complete the instruction sequence
vs Byakuya:              defeat him

You can skip the training levels by pressing the SELECT button if you wish.
Below is a translation of Japanese phrases used during the training levels.
General command translations are listed above in SECTION I under COMMON TERMS.

ÉWÉÉÉìÉvíÜÇ…    while jumping
óßÇøíÜÇ…        while standing
ÇµÇ·Ç™Ç›íÜÇ…    while crouching
óÏïÑÇÉ^ÉbÉ`    touch reifu
äoåÂÇåàÇﬂÇΩÇÁ  when finished
ñhå‰íÜÇ…        while guarding
É_ÉÅÅ[ÉWíÜÇ…    while taking damage

The first 5 matches will always be the same no matter what you do. Once you
reach Renji for the second time, he'll serve as a checkpoint of sorts, and
depending on how many reiatsu stock you have in reserves when you defeat him,
you'll branch out to different paths. In order to fully complete Ichigo's
story, you must defeat every character listed above at least once. If you
successfully complete all the requirements in Ichigo's story, it will be marked
as COMPLETE in the episode select screen. If you skip over a character, it will
be marked CLEAR and you will have to replay it in order to unlock everything.

You do not have to play through Ichigo's story in the exact order listed above,
but this seems to be the simplest route that I can find. For completion's sake,
below is a translation of all the special objectives you are given whenever you
fight any character for the second time. Pay attention to the text before the
match, and if you see a red phrase, check below to see what it means.

RENJI:
óÏà≥Ç™ç≈ëÂ = win with max reiatsu stock (3) -> KYORAKU/UKITAKE ROUTE
óÏà≥Ç™ç≈è¨ = win with min reiatsu stock (0) -> HITSUGAYA/HINAMORI ROUTE
ÇªÇÍà»äO   = win with other condition (1 or 2 reiatsu stock) -> KENPACHI ROUTE

HITSUGAYA & HINAMORI:
íNÇ™êÊÇ…ì|ÇÍÇÈÇ© = defeat me (Hitsugaya) first

KENPACHI:
ç∞ÈÆÇÃécó  = win with a small amount of health (exact amount unknown)

KYORAKU & UKITAKE:
òAë±ÉqÉbÉgêî = perform a large combo (20+ hits)

KUROTSUCHI:
èuï‡ã÷é~Ç»Ç« = do not use flash steps

TOSEN & KOMAMURA:
óÏï{égópñáêî = use all of your reifu

Ñ† UNLOCK GUIDE Ñ†
Ñ§--------------Ñ£
After completing Ichigo's story, the episodes for Orihime, Uryu, Chad, and
Ganju are unlocked. Clearing their episodes opens up additional ones in the
following order:

Orihime -> Kenpachi   -> Tosen   -> Komamura  -> Komamura (unmasked)
Uryu    -> Kurotsuchi -> Soifon  -> Yoruichi  -> Rukia
Chad    -> Kyoraku    -> Ukitake -> Genryusai -> Ichimaru
Ganju   -> Renji      -> Byakuya -> Hitsugaya -> Hinamori

Clearing all of the above episodes unlocks Aizen's, and clearing his unlocks
the final episode. Clearing the final story episode unlocks Time Attack Mode,
Survival Mode, and grants you a one-time bonus of 500000 points to spend at the
shop.

Clearing Ichigo's story yields 100000 shop points each time. Clearing other
episodes grants you 1000 points per match. A variety of level 1 reifu are
unlocked through Ichigo's story, which then allows you to buy additional copies
and higher level versions of those cards through the shop.

Initially, 14 characters are available for play in Arcade, VS, Training, Time
Attack, Survival, and Challenge modes. Below are the requirements for unlocking
the other 14 characters. (Not all characters are available in Challenge Mode.)

Ukitake:             defeat him in Ichigo's story
Komamura:            defeat him in Ichigo's story
Soifon:              defeat her in Ichigo's story
Genryusai:           defeat him in Ichigo's story
Yoruichi:            clear (or skip) advanced training in Ichigo's story
Tatsuki:             clear Orihime's story
Bonnie:              clear Ganju's story
Yachiru:             clear Kenpachi's story
Nemu:                clear Kurotsuchi's story

Aizen:               clear all other characters' stories
Ichigo (Hollow):     clear the final story episode

Once a character is unlocked, you may purchase that character's corresponding
System Voice set from the shop. Voice sets for non-playable characters are made
available as follows:

Yamada Hanatarou:    clear Ganju's story
Madarame Ikkaku:     clear Kenpachi's story
Ayasegawa Yumichika: clear Kenpachi's story
Urahara Kisuke:      clear Yoruichi's story
Kira Iduru:          clear Ichimaru's story
Shiba Kaien:         clear the final story episode

Event and character graphics are unlocked in the Gallery simply after viewing
them in Story Mode. However, if you press Start to skip through the cutscenes,
you might skip over some of these graphics, which prevents you from unlocking
them. Hold down to fast-forward through story mode text instead of skipping it,
and you'll unlock everything.

Ñ§---------------------------------------------------------------------------Ñ£
All characters are available for play in Arcade Mode, which consists of 6
1-on-1 fights in succession. Clearing each character's arcade sequence for the
first time will net you a significant reward, either a level 4 reifu or 200000
points for use in the shop. The word "CLEAR" will appear in the bottom-left
corner of the screen for each character you've already played. You will also
receive 2000 points from each match every time you play.

Versus Mode has play modes for up to 4 players total, either human or CPU,
online or offline, and single-cart or multi-cart. Choose VS CPU for matches
against only the computer, WIRELESS BATTLE for matches against other players
with their own copies of the game, DOWNLOAD PLAY for single-cart multiplayer,
or Wi-Fi CONNECTION for Internet multiplayer through the Nintendo Wi-Fi
Connection. All modes besides VS CPU will reward you with 2000 points for the
shop for every match you play, whether you win or lose.

Ñ§-----------------------------Ñ£
As I do not have another DS or copy of the game available for testing, I cannot
provide detailed information regarding either of these gameplay modes. However,
all characters and stages are known to be available in single-cart download
play, and no particular aspect of the game seems to be restricted. The only
drawback appears to be long load times.

Bleach DS features a very fleshed-out online mode with ranking matches, friend

If you have not gone online with your Nintendo DS prior to this, you may have
to adjust settings in the Wi-Fi SETTINGS screen (third selection on the menu).
The Wi-Fi configuration menus are set-up in a completely different manner than
the rest of the game and should in fact bear a very close resemblance to the
Wi-Fi configuration menus in any other online-capable Nintendo DS game. If you
have an English-language Nintendo DS game with Wi-Fi Connection features, the
settings menu in Bleach DS should look exactly the same, only in Japanese. If
you require a translation, check www.nintendowifi.com for downloadable manuals
in your native language.

Using the REIFU OFF filter also prohibits the use of team battles and
handicaps.

JAPAN BATTLE will randomly pit you against anyone else connecting to the
servers, FRIEND BATTLE will narrow down the field to those on your Friend List,
and SOUL SOCIETY RANKING MATCH will attempt to match you up in a 1-on-1 fight
with another player who holds the same rank as you. All new players start with
a spirit level of 1000. You earn and lose points as you win and lose matches,
and your rank will change accordingly. Should you disconnect from a ranking
match by turning off your DS or letting the battery run out, your spirit level
will be reduced by 2000 points.

All new players start with the rank title of "ëÊè\ê»óÏà ," which roughly
translates to "Tenth Seat." The second character is a number which changes as
your spirit level increases. Based on the experience I've put into Wi-Fi so
far, the promotions are as follows:

                               28000 ëÊàÍê»óÏà 
                               23000 ëÊìÒê»óÏà 
                               18500 ëÊéOê»óÏà

                                   0 ëÊè\ê»óÏà 

You advance to Ninth Seat after earning 1000 points, to Eighth Seat after
earning another 1500, to Seventh Seat after earning another 2000, and so on
with the interval increasing by 500 points for each iteration. I can confirm
that the pattern continues until at least Third Seat. Assuming that Vice
Captain and Captain follow First Seat, the requirement for the top rank would
be 39500 points.

This mode allows 1-on-1 practice against the computer. Your life bar
automatically refills itself and you can instruct your CPU opponent to perform
certain actions.

Ñ°---------------------------------------------------------------------------Ñ¢
Ñ† SECTION VIII: TIME ATTACK MODE (É^ÉCÉÄÉAÉ^ÉbÉNÉÇÅ[Éh)                     Ñ†
Ñ§---------------------------------------------------------------------------Ñ£
This mode is unlocked upon the completion of the final episode of Story Mode.
It consists of a sequence of 20 1-on-1 fights against the computer in the
following order:

Ganju
Orihime
Chad
Hinamori
Renji
Uryu
Rukia
Tosen

Kurotsuchi
Soifon
Hitsugaya

Kyoraku
Ukitake
Byakuya
Yoruichi

Genryusai

Reifu can be reused between battles and the maximum money reward for completion
seems to be 48000. No items are earned through Time Attack Mode.

Ñ§---------------------------------------------------------------------------Ñ£
This mode is also unlocked upon completion of the final episode of Story Mode.
Survival Mode consists of an endless amount of 1-on-1 fights against the
computer until you die or quit. Health and reifu are not restored between
matches, and your reiatsu and reiryoku gauges carry over between matches
instead of being reset to zero. The recommended strategy is to use a deck built
mainly for healing. Aizen is a preferable character to use, as the AI has a
hard time dealing with many of his moves.

The order of the first 20 matches is pre-determined (same order as Time Attack
Mode, above). After 20 matches, you will fight against any of the previous 20
characters randomly (though it seems that there is a greater chance of
replaying characters that gave you more trouble).

No items are rewarded, but the monetary gain is impressive. You receive a
moderate amount for the first few wins, but after a time the amount begins
increasing by leaps and bounds.

REWARDS
  1 win:      200
  2 wins:    1000
  3 wins:    3000
  4 wins:    7000
  5 wins:   15000

This mode is available for 20 different characters. The goal is to complete
each of the 10 chain combo sequences displayed on screen for each character.
You will receive 50000 shop points and a level 4 reifu upon completion of each
character's challenge.

Ñ† GENERAL TIPS Ñ†
Ñ§--------------Ñ£

UNDERSTANDING CHAIN COMBOS AND INSERTING BUFFERING TECHNIQUES
Normal, special, and super attacks in Bleach DS are generally chained from
weaker attacks to stronger attacks, meaning that it is usually possible to
follow a light attack with a medium attack and a medium with a heavy, but not a
heavy to a medium or a heavy followed by another heavy. Furthermore, it is
usually possible to chain a light/medium/heavy normal attack to a special and a
special to a super, but not the other way around. (There are a few notable
exceptions to this rule, which should become apparent as you play each
individual characters' challenges. Faster characters can chain light attacks
together indefinitely, Uryu can fire three heavy attacks in succession with his
bow, Komamura can link standing heavy to crouching heavy, etc.) Because of this
limitation, most combo challenges cannot be performed exactly as they're
written, and you'll have to insert extra attacks and techniques between certain
moves in order to link them together without breaking the chain. The most
common examples are using flash steps to continue combos on the ground and
double jumps to continue combos in mid-air. Many required and recommended
buffering techniques will be listed in the walkthrough below in [brackets].

POSITIONING
Many combo challenges are easier if done right next to the wall. In the
walkthrough below, assume that every combo is meant to be done next to the wall
unless stated otherwise.

SPECIALS AND REINFORCED SPECIALS
Many special attacks have three different versions: light, medium, and
reinforced (RF), which are performed with the light, medium, and heavy attack
buttons, respectively. Remember that using the touch screen to perform specials
has the same behavior as using the heavy attack button, so using the touch
screen to perform specials will always perform the RF version for that special
if it exists and if you have enough reiryoku to perform it. If a combo
challenge asks you to perform the RF version, you cannot perform the light or
medium version. The opposite holds true as well. Additionally, light specials
usually have a quick set-up but long recovery time, and medium specials usually
have a long set-up and quick recovery time. If you're having trouble trying to
complete a combo with one variation of a special attack, try out the other and
see if it makes it any easier.

INSTANT AERIAL DASH (IAD)
Sometimes you'll be asked to link a series of aerial attacks followed by a
series of standing attacks. Typically, the ideal way to do this is to perform
an instant aerial dash, which will keep your character close enough to the
ground so you can land and continue the combo quickly. To perform an IAD, jump
diagonally towards the CPU dummy, and then immediately press forward to dash
once you're in mid-air. Perform the required aerial attacks before you touch
the ground, and then follow up with the rest of the combo. (Depending on how
close you land to the dummy, it can sometimes be helpful to quickly dash next
to the dummy once you touch ground again, but this isn't necessary for every
combo.)

OFF-THE-GROUND (OTG) ATTACKS
When you strike a falling opponent in mid-air, it will normally keep him in an
aerial state. However, if you strike him just as he initially hits the ground,
it will put him into a standing state, which allows you to proceed with a
standing combo more easily. The timing window for this technique is very
strict.

Ñ† INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE WALKTHROUGHS Ñ†
Ñ§-----------------------------------Ñ£
Below are instructions that should be useful in completing many of the various
challenge combos in the game. If a combo is not listed below, then it should be
easy enough to complete as it is written. Translations for the Japanese kanji
are listed above in SECTION I under COMMON TERMS. Here is the notation that
I'll be using for this section:

manage to flash step close enough to the dummy for the rest of the combo to
reach. Both swipes of S-C must connect in order for it to register.

ICHIGO 9: RF-A Å® aM Å® [FS] Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH
You must stand a short distance away from the dummy in order to make RF-A
juggle him. Jump diagonally towards him while he's being juggled to connect aM,
and then flash step closer to him to finish the combo.

ICHIGO 10: cH Å® aM Å® aM Å® [FS] Å® aM Å® [FS] Å® aM Å® [FS] Å® aM Å® RF-C
Pretty straightforward. Make sure to jump and double jump high enough during
the first two aMs in order to make the rest of the combo connect.

RUKIA 1: sL Å® sM Å® sH Å® S-A
Use the medium version of S-A.

RUKIA 3: cL Å® sH Å® [FS] Å® S-D

RUKIA 4: [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® cL Å® sH Å® SU-A
Both the lightning and the fireball parts of SU-A must connect for it to
register.

RUKIA 5: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® cL Å® cH Å® SU-B

RUKIA 6A: [IAD] aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® [D] sL Å® sL Å® sL Å® sL Å® [FS] Å® sL Å® sL
          Å® sL Å® sL Å® [FS] Å® sL Å® sL Å® sL Å® sL Å® [FS] Å® sL Å® sL Å® cH
          Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL
This one isn't quite as intimidating as it might seem as first. When on the
ground, stay close enough to the dummy to get 4 light attacks in at a time
between flash steps. When in the air, get 4 light attacks in before and after
the double jump.

RUKIA 6B: [IAD] aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® [D] sL Å® [D] sL Å® [D] sL Å® [D] sL
          Å® [D] sL Å® [D] sL Å® [D] sL Å® [D] sL Å® [D] sL Å® [D] sL Å® [D] sL
          Å® [D] sL Å® [D] sL Å® [D] sL Å® cH Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL
          Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL
An alternate method for Rukia's 6th combo. If you're fast enough, it's possible
to alternate between dashing and sL indefinitely.

RUKIA 8: RF-D Å® RF-C Å® [D] sL Å® sM Å® sH Å® RF-B
You must use RF-D to kick the dummy from one side of the screen to the other.
RF-C will freeze him in place so you can run up to him and finish the combo.

RUKIA 9: aH Å® S-A Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH
Position yourself between the dummy and the wall to keep S-A from pushing you
backwards. Jump straight into the air and connect aH and S-A just before you
touch the ground, then jump again and follow up with the rest of the combo.

RUKIA 10: cH Å® aL Å® aL Å® RF-A Å® SU-A
The key to this one is jumping high enough during the 2 aLs so that SU-A is
able to connect at the end. Get as much height as you can before hitting the
dummy with the light attacks, and you should be fine.

ORIHIME 3: [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® cL Å® cH Å® S-C

ORIHIME 4: S-A Å® S-D
Time S-D so that it connects as S-A is coming back towards you.

ORIHIME 6: SU-B Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH
           Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH
Pin the dummy against the wall with SU-B to hold him in place. Perform an IAD
to connect two aerial hits, land, and repeat 5 times to finish the combo before
he recovers.

ORIHIME 7: cL Å® cM Å® cH Å® RF-A Å® [D] cL Å® cM Å® cH Å® cL Å® cM Å® cH
RF-A will hit the dummy a second time as it returns to you, allowing you to
chain cH to cL.

ORIHIME 8: T Å® SU-B Å® cL Å® cM Å® cH Å® RF-A Å® [D] sL Å® sH Å® aL Å® aH
           Å® aL Å® aH Å® RF-B
It might be easier to execute this combo in the middle of the arena as opposed
to the wall. Perform SU-B first, and then throw the dummy into the barrier. Hit
him with cL as he bounces back towards you, then follow with the rest of the
combo.

ORIHIME 9: SU-A Å® SU-B Å® S-D
Perform SU-B first, and pin the dummy against the wall with it. Charge SU-A to
maximum size before you release it. Performing S-D will make the previous
barrier formed with SU-B disappear, so you have to time it such that SU-A hits
the dummy a second time as you're setting up S-D.

ORIHIME 10: cL Å® cH Å® SU-A Å® [D] cL Å® cM Å® cH Å® [D] cL Å® cH Å® SU-A
            Å® [D] cL Å® cM Å® cH Å® [D] cL Å® cH Å® SU-A Å® [D] cL Å® cM Å® cH
            Å® [D] cL Å® cH
I can't think of much advice to give on this one besides getting a feel for the
timing needed to keep the chain from breaking. Just do it as it says. It's a
little easier to time the normal hits if you manage to let SU-A carry the dummy
back and forth a little bit whenever it hits him.

URYU 2: S-A Å® S-B Å® RF-A
Launch S-B first, then perform S-A. S-B will fall and hit the dummy after S-A.

URYU 3: [IAD] aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® [D] sL Å® sL Å® sL Å® S-C

URYU 5: sM Å® sH Å® sM Å® [FS] Å® sH Å® sM Å® sH Å® SU-B

URYU 6: T Å® [OTG] cL Å® sH Å® [FS] Å® cL Å® sH Å® [FS] Å® cL Å® sH Å® SU-B

URYU 7: S-A Å® S-B Å® [IAD] aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® sL Å® sM Å® sH Å® RF-A
Launch S-B first, just like his second challenge.

URYU 8: RF-C Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH Å® SU-B
Charge RF-C to its max size, and it'll juggle the dummy enough to allow you to
follow up with the rest of the combo.

URYU 9: sL Å® sM Å® sH Å® S-B Å® RF-C Å® aL Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH Å® SU-B
Launch S-B first. You don't have to charge RF-C this time. S-B should hit the
dummy at the same time as RF-C, so following up with the aerial part should be
easy.

URYU 10: sM Å® sH Å® sM Å® [FS] Å® sH Å® sM Å® sH Å® [FS] Å® sM Å® sH Å® sM
         Å® [FS] Å® sH Å® sM Å® sH

CHAD 4: [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® sL Å® sM Å® RF-A Å® SU-A
It's easier to link RF-A to SU-A if done in the middle of the arena as opposed
to the wall.

CHAD 5: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® [D] cL Å® cH Å® RF-B Å® SU-B

CHAD 8: cL Å® sH Å® RF-B Å® [OTG] cL Å® cM Å® S-B Å® SU-A
sH will launch the dummy, and RF-B will bounce him off the wall. Turn around
and use an OTG hit to finish the rest of the combo.

CHAD 9: cL Å® cH Å® S-B Å® SU-A Å® [OTG] cL Å® cH Å® SU-B Å® aL Å® aM Å® aL
        Å® aM Å® aH
The key to this one is starting the combo the proper distance away from the
wall in order to time the OTG hit.

CHAD 10: [IAD] aH Å® RF-C Å® [IAD] aH Å® RF-C Å® [IAD] aH Å® RF-C Å® [IAD] aH
         Å® cL Å® cM Å® cH Å® SU-C

GANJU 4: cH Å® S-D
The light version of S-D summons Bonnie on the same plane as Ganju, and the
medium version summons her on the opposite plane. You must perform S-D first
and then time cH so that it hits the dummy right before Bonnie does.

GANJU 5: [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® sL Å® sM Å® SU-A

GANJU 6: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® cL Å® cH Å® SU-B

GANJU 7: S-D Å® SU-C
SU-C travels in an arc. Time it so that it intercepts the dummy after Bonnie
launches him.

GANJU 8: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® [D] sL Å® sM Å® RF-C Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH Å® aL Å® aM
         Å® aH
Dash after landing to stay close to the dummy or else RF-C probably won't
connect. Jump after him quickly after the launch to get in the rest of the
combo.

GANJU 9: [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® sL Å® sM Å® S-B Å® [OTG] cL Å® cM Å® cH Å® RF-B
         Å® SU-B
Don't perform this one right next to the wall. S-B will carry the dummy across
the screen, giving you enough time to dash up next to him and follow with the
rest of the combo after the bounce.

GANJU 10: RF-A Å® RF-D Å® aL Å® aM Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH
RF-D will summon Bonnie on both planes. She'll run across the opposite plane as
Ganju first and the same plane second. Use RF-D first, throw RF-A, and then
jump into the air to finish the rest of the combo. You have to be careful to
time all of it so that Bonnie does not hit Ganju.

RENJI 4: [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® sL Å® sH Å® SU-A

RENJI 5: [IAD] aL Å® aH Å® cL Å® cH Å® SU-B

RENJI 6: T Å® S-C
Throw the dummy from around the middle of the screen, and then use the medium
version of S-C to hit him after he bounces off the wall.

RENJI 9: [cM] Å® RF-B Å® cL Å® sH Å® SU-A
Use cM to launch the dummy into the air, and then use RF-B just as he begins
falling back to the ground. Follow with the rest of the combo after he bounces
off the wall.

RENJI 10: S-A Å® [OTG] cL Å® sH Å® [FS] Å® cL Å® sH Å® [FS] Å® cL Å® sH Å® RF-A
          Å® SU-A
Use the medium version of S-A, as it has less recovery time. Make sure to wait
until RF-A registers before following up with SU-A.

BYAKUYA 5: SU-B Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH

BYAKUYA 6: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® sL Å® sH Å® SU-C

BYAKUYA 7: T Å® S-B
Throw the dummy to the other side of the screen and use S-B right as he bounces
off the wall.

BYAKUYA 8: [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® aH Å® sL Å® sH Å® S-B Å® SU-A

BYAKUYA 9: S-D Å® sL Å® S-D Å® sL Å® SU-C
Perform two S-Ds at the start of the combo, then follow with two sLs. The
second S-D should hit the dummy between the sLs.

BYAKUYA 10: cL Å® sH Å® RF-C Å® [D] cL Å® sH Å® RF-C Å® S-B Å® SU-C
Dash towards the dummy a little bit after the first RF-C.

ICHIMARU 6: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® sL Å® sH Å® SU-B

ICHIMARU 7: T Å® [OTG] RF-C Å® sL Å® sH Å® S-A

ICHIMARU 8: S-C Å® RF-C Å® sL Å® sH Å® RF-C Å® cL Å® cH Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH Å® aL
            Å® aM Å® aH Å® RF-A
Use the medium version of S-C, as it has less recovery time. Ichimaru's aH has
multiple hits, and the last hit will smash the opponent back down to the ground
if it connects. In order to complete this combo, you must enter the next
command before aH finishes so you can keep juggling the dummy in mid-air.

ICHIMARU 9: cL Å® cH Å® RF-C Å® sL Å® sH Å® RF-C Å® cL Å® cH Å® RF-E Å® SU-A
Ichimaru's cH also has multiple hits, and the last hit will launch the opponent
into the air if it connects. In order to complete this combo, you must enter
the next command before cH finishes so you can continue the combo on the
ground.

ICHIMARU 10: cH Å® cH Å® [FS] Å® cH Å® cH Å® RF-C Å® cL Å® cH Å® RF-C Å® cL
             Å® cH Å® RF-C Å® cL Å® cH Å® S-A
Flash step after cH hits the second time to prevent the dummy from being
launched, then follow with the rest of the combo.

KENPACHI 4: T Å® S-B
Throw the dummy from around the middle of the screen, and then use the light
version of S-B to hit him after the bounce.

KENPACHI 5: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® sL Å® sH Å® RF-E Å® SU-B

KENPACHI 6: [S-D] Å® [SU-A] Å® [SU-A] Å® [SU-A] Å® [IAD] aH Å® aH Å® [D] sL
            Å® sH Å® sH Å® RF-E Å® aM Å® aM Å® aM Å® aM Å® aH
Fully charge S-D and perform three SU-As before starting this combo. Kenpachi's
S-D temporarily increases the length of his sword, and his SU-A temporarily
allows him to chain normal attacks together in ways that typically aren't
possible. (His SU-A also prevents opponents from damage cancelling out of
normal attacks.)

KENPACHI 7: [S-D] Å® [SU-A] Å® [SU-A] Å® [SU-A] Å® sL Å® sL Å® sM Å® sH Å® sH
            Å® [FS] Å® sL Å® sL Å® sM Å® sH Å® sH Å® [FS] Å® sL Å® sL Å® sM
            Å® sH Å® sH Å® [FS] Å® sL Å® sL Å® sM Å® sH Å® sH 

KENPACHI 8: [S-D] Å® sM Å® RF-E Å® [SU-A] Å® sM Å® RF-E Å® [SU-A] Å® sM Å® RF-E
            Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH
This time, use SU-A to cancel RF-E and keep the combo going on the ground. You
may have to double jump during the aerial part to connect all three hits.

KENPACHI 9: cL Å® cM Å® sH Å® S-B Å® [SU-A] Å® [OTG] cL Å® cM Å® sH Å® S-B
            Å® [SU-A] Å® [OTG] cL Å® cM Å® sH Å® S-B Å® [SU-A] Å® [OTG] cL
            Å® cM Å® sH Å® S-B
Use the light version of S-B, as it has a shorter set-up time than the medium
version. Use SU-A after S-B to cancel its recovery time, then keep the combo
going. I hope you're good at timing OTG hits...

KENPACHI 10: cL Å® S-E Å® [SU-A] Å® cL Å® S-E Å® [SU-A] Å® cL Å® S-E Å® [SU-A]
             Å® cL Å® S-E
This one should be a piece of cake if you completed his 9th challenge. Use the
light version of S-E, and perform SU-A immediately after S-E connects in order
to prevent the dummy from being launched.

HITSUGAYA 3: S-C Å® cL Å® cM Å® cH
Perform cL after S-C hits the dummy for the second time.

HITSUGAYA 7: S-C Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® cL Å® cM Å® cH Å® RF-B Å® SU-A
Perform aM after S-C hits the dummy for the second time. cH should be done
quickly in order for it to connect.

HITSUGAYA 8: RF-A Å® [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® sL Å® sM Å® sH Å® aL Å® aM Å® aL Å® aM
             Å® RF-A
Stand a short distance away from the dummy so that RF-A hits him multiple
times. This should give you enough time to connect aL.

HITSUGAYA 9: RF-A Å® RF-C Å® cL Å® cM Å® cH Å® RF-B Å® SU-A
Perform RF-C first, then immediately follow with RF-A. RF-C will hit a second
time, and you can follow with the rest of the combo. Perform SU-A immediately
after RF-B registers to prevent Hitsugaya from jumping.

HITSUGAYA 10: SU-A Å® RF-C Å® [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® cL Å® cM Å® [FS] Å® [cL] Å® cH
              Å® RF-B Å® SU-A
Stand far enough away from the dummy so that SU-A hits him at the end of its
arc. RF-C will carry the dummy back towards Hitsugaya. If you have trouble
connecting cM to cH, try inserting a flash step and cL as written above.

HINAMORI 3: cL Å® cM Å® cH Å® S-C Å® [FS] Å® cL Å® cM Å® Ch
Perform S-C first, and time the first three hits so that S-C detonates
immediately after the first cH. Flash step next to the dummy and continue the
combo.

HINAMORI 7: SU-B Å® RF-E
This one is easier if done from the initial position instead of the wall. Just
do it as it says as quickly as possible with the touch screen.

HINAMORI 8: T Å® RF-C Å® cL Å® cH Å® aL Å® aH Å® aL Å® aH Å® RF-A
Shoot RF-C in the opposite direction from the dummy, placing Hinamori between
the dummy and the fireballs. Throw him into the fireballs, and then continue
with cL.

HINAMORI 9: RF-C Å® sL Å® sH Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH Å® RF-C Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH
            Å® RF-C
Position the dummy next to the wall, stand right next to him, and perform RF-C.
Two fireballs should detonate, leaving one next to him. Wait a little, then
jump above the dummy and perform RF-C again to place 3 fireballs above him.
When the fireball next to him detonates, continue the actual combo with sL and
launch with sH. One of the fireballs in the air should connect after the first
aH, allowing you to continue the combo with aL. Do it as it says to from there.

HINAMORI 10: RF-B Å® [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® sL Å® sH Å® aL Å® aH Å® aL Å® aH Å® RF-C
             Å® [FS] Å® aH Å® RF-A
Stand a short distance away from the dummy so that RF-B connects at the end of
its arc. Get enough height during the jump and double jump so that RF-C is
performed at the top of the screen. This will hold the dummy in place, allowing
you to flash step next to him and finish the combo.

TOSEN 1: RF-C Å® RF-A
Use RF-C to carry the dummy from one side of the screen to the other. RF-A will
connect shortly after he bounces off the wall.

TOSEN 2: sL Å® sM Å® [FS] Å® [sL] Å® sH Å® S-B
If you have trouble connecting S-B at the end, try inserting a flash step and
sL to shorten the distance between you and the dummy.

TOSEN 5: sM Å® sH Å® [FS] Å® [sL] Å® S-E

TOSEN 6: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® cL Å® sM Å® sH Å® SU-A

TOSEN 7: RF-E Å® aL Å® aM Å® aL Å® aM Å® SU-A
Stand far enough away from the dummy so that RF-E connects at the very end.
This should give you enough time to jump and continue the combo.

TOSEN 8: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® cL Å® sM Å® sH Å® RF-B Å® RF-C Å® RF-E

TOSEN 9: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® RF-D Å® [D] cL Å® sH Å® RF-C Å® cL Å® sH Å® RF-A
RF-D has the tendency to push Tosen away from the dummy. You must perform RF-D
in the air as close to the ground as possible before you reach the point where
it pushes you back a greater distance. Once you touch the ground, dash just a
little bit in order to close the gap between you and the dummy, then finish the
combo as it is written.

TOSEN 10: cL Å® cM Å® S-B Å® [D] cL Å® cM Å® RF-B Å® RF-C Å® cL Å® cH Å® aL
          Å® aM Å® aL Å® aM Å® SU-A
Start this one with Tosen positioned next to the wall. This will prevent S-B
from pushing him backwards. You do not have to follow RF-C with an OTG hit, but
it does help a little.

KOMAMURA 5: SU-B Å® aH
Make sure to perform the aH as quickly as possible.

KOMAMURA 6: T Å® [OTG] cL Å® cH Å® RF-A Å® RF-C

KOMAMURA 8: SU-B Å® SU-A Å® [FS] Å® aH
Flash step just enough to get the dummy in range as he's in mid-air. If you're
too slow with the aH, you won't be able to damage him.

KOMAMURA 9: S-A Å® cL Å® cH Å® RF-A Å® [D] cL Å® cH Å® RF-A Å® [D] cL Å® cH
            Å® RF-C
Start the combo with the medium version of S-A, and dash a little bit closer to
the dummy after each RF-A.

KOMAMURA 10: sL Å® sH Å® cH Å® [FS] Å® sL Å® sH Å® cH Å® [FS] Å® sL Å® sH Å® Ch
             Å® [FS] Å® sL Å® sH Å® cH Å® SU-A

KUROTSUCHI 2: S-B Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH

KUROTSUCHI 3: [S-C] Å® sL Å® sM Å® sH Å® S-D
Use S-C to position Nemu next to the dummy.

KUROTSUCHI 4: sL Å® sH Å® S-E Å® aH
Start the combo with the medium version of S-E, then enter the two standing
hits before Nemu launches the dummy.

KUROTSUCHI 6: S-B Å® SU-B
Normally, SU-B will enter the screen from behind Kurotsuchi. Hold back when
performing SU-B to make it enter from the opposite side.

KUROTSUCHI 8: S-A Å® sL Å® sH Å® RF-A Å® sL Å® sH Å® RF-A Å® sL Å® sH Å® RF-A
              Å® sL Å® sH Å® S-A
Start the combo with the medium version of S-A and end it with the light
version.

KUROTSUCHI 9: sL Å® sH Å® RF-B Å® [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® sL Å® sH Å® RF-A Å® sL
              Å® sH Å® RF-E Å® S-D Å® sL Å® sH Å® SU-A
Use the medium version of S-D immediately after RF-E. You do not have to follow
it with an OTG hit.

KUROTSUCHI 10: [S-C] Å® T Å® S-D Å® sL Å® sH Å® RF-A Å® sL Å® sH Å® RF-A Å® sL
               Å® sH Å® RF-B Å® [D] S-D Å® [D] sL Å® sH Å® SU-A
Position Nemu at one side of the screen, and throw the dummy towards her from
the other side. Detonate Nemu with S-D before the dummy reaches her, and he
should bounce back towards you. Use RF-B to make Nemu grab him when she
returns, detonate her, and finish the combo. You may have to dash towards the
other side of the screen before and after the second S-D as written above in
order to reach the dummy.

KYORAKU 5: sL Å® sM Å® sH Å® SU-B
Perform this combo with the dummy positioned to the left of Kyoraku. Hold left
while using SU-B to make it connect.

KYORAKU 7: sH Å® aL Å® aH Å® aL Å® aH Å® aL Å® aH Å® aL Å® aH Å® aL Å® aH
           Å® S-B
Kyoraku can use his reiryoku gauge to jump multiple times in mid-air instead of
using flash steps.

KYORAKU 8: cL Å® cH Å® RF-B Å® SU-A Å® [OTG] cL Å® cH Å® RF-B Å® aL Å® aH Å® aL
           Å® aH Å® RF-B Å® SU-B
Perform this combo a short distance away from the wall so that you have enough
time to follow SU-A with cL.

KYORAKU 9: sH Å® aL Å® aH Å® aL Å® aH Å® aL Å® aH Å® SU-A Å® aM Å® aM Å® aH
           Å® SU-A Å® aM Å® aM Å® aH Å® SU-B
Perform this combo a short distance away from the wall so that you have enough
time to follow SU-A with aM. Use additional jumps instead of flash steps to
keep the combo going in mid-air.

KYORAKU 10: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® cL Å® cM Å® RF-A Å® cL Å® cH Å® SU-A Å® [OTG] cL
            Å® cH Å® RF-B Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH Å® RF-B Å® SU-B
Perform this combo next to the wall. The crouching attacks will push you far
enough away from the dummy so that you can get in all of the required hits.

UKITAKE 1: S-A Å® sH Å® sH Å® sH Å® sH
Use the medium version of S-A to hold the dummy in place as you finish the rest
of the combo.

UKITAKE 3: S-B Å® S-C
Use the medium version of S-B and the light version of S-C.

UKITAKE 5: [S-C] / [S-D] Å® S-E Å® cL Å® cM Å® cH
Set up a white energy ball with either the light, medium, or heavy version of
S-E. In order to get it to actually fire, you have to touch it with a beam from
either S-C or S-D. Follow with the rest of the combo after it connects.

UKITAKE 7: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® sL Å® sH Å® SU-B

UKITAKE 9: RF-A Å® RF-D Å® SU-B Å® [RF-D] Å® S-E Å® sL Å® sM Å® sH Å® SU-A
Start the combo by performing the heavy version of S-E and then using RF-D
later in order to make it fire.

UKITAKE 10: S-A Å® S-D Å® S-E Å® S-A Å® S-D Å® S-E Å® S-A Å® S-D Å® S-E Å® SU-A
Start the combo by performing three heavy S-Es. Use light versions of S-A to
hold the dummy in place, and then use light S-Ds to hit him and fire the
pre-set S-Es.

SOIFON 2: [IAD] aL Å® aH Å® S-B

SOIFON 9: [SU-B] Å® [IAD] aL Å® RF-B Å® [IAD] aL Å® RF-B Å® cL Å® cM Å® cH
          Å® RF-C Å® SU-A
SU-B will summon 20 ninjas to drop kick the dummy in 5 sets of 4. Time the aLs
so that they hit right after each 4th ninja. The ninjas will keep the dummy in
place, allowing you to continue the combo.

SOIFON 10: SU-B Å® [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® S-B Å® [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® S-B Å® [IAD] aL
           Å® aM Å® S-B Å® [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® S-B Å® [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® S-B
Same idea as the last combo. Time the aerial hits so that they occur in-between
each set of ninjas.

GENRYUSAI 6: [IAD] aL Å® aH Å® cL Å® cM Å® SU-A

GENRYUSAI 7: [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® sL Å® sM Å® S-E Å® SU-B

GENRYUSAI 9: sL Å® sL Å® sM Å® S-E Å® SU-A Å® sL Å® sL Å® sM Å® S-E Å® SU-A
             Å® sL Å® sL Å® sM Å® S-E Å® SU-A Å® sL Å® sH Å® RF-D Å® aL Å® aL
             Å® RF-D Å® aL Å® aH
This one is tricky, but you can do it just about exactly as it instructs you
to. Use light versions of S-E.

GENRYUSAI 10: [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® sL Å® sM Å® RF-A Å® [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® sL Å® sM
              Å® [SU-B] Å® [D] RF-B Å® [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® sL Å® sM Å® RF-C
              Å® [IAD] aL Å® aM Å® sL Å® sH Å® aL Å® aM Å® S-D
It is tough (if not impossible) to follow RF-B with aL as this challenge is
written. Use SU-B as written above to give you more time to set up the rest of
the combo. Use the light version of S-D at the very end.

YORUICHI 1: cL Å® cH Å® S-A Å® cL Å® cH
Set up the medium version of S-A first and then start the combo. The knives
should connect as you hit the dummy, allowing you to chain cH to cL.

YORUICHI 4: [IAD] aL Å® aH Å® cL Å® cH Å® SU-A

YORUICHI 5: [IAD] aM Å® aH Å® cL Å® cM Å® cH Å® SU-C

YORUICHI 7: S-B Å® S-A Å® aL Å® aM Å® aH
Perform the medium version of S-A first (same as her first challenge), and then
use S-B to start the combo.

YORUICHI 8: S-B Å® [RF-A] Å® RF-B Å® SU-A Å® aM Å® aH Å® S-C
Start the combo with RF-A, which will allow you to chain medium S-B to RF-B.
Use the light version of S-C at the end.

YORUICHI 9: [IAD] aL Å® aH Å® RF-A Å® [IAD] aL Å® aH Å® [IAD] aL Å® aH Å® sL
            Å® sM Å® RF-B Å® SU-C Å® aM Å® aH Å® aM Å® aH Å® RF-C
Start the combo with a mid-air RF-A, and then dash into the aL before you touch
the ground. The knives will hold the dummy in place until you get to the
standing attacks, and you can simply perform the combo as it says to from
there.

YORUICHI 10: RF-C Å® RF-A Å® aM Å® RF-C
Piece of cake compared to the previous one. Start with the RF-A and then
perform the other attacks as fast as you can. The knives will keep juggling the
dummy.

The default pattern menu contains a recommended deck for most of the
characters. None of them are particularly great, however, as they only use
level 1 cards. You'd best choose to customize your own.

The customize screen is laid out like so:
 - cards currently in your chosen deck on the left
 - cards remaining in reserves on the right
 - a filter at the top that narrows the reserve selection by category/color
 - a filter at the bottom that narrows the reserve selection by level
 - a switch in the middle that swaps the selected cards on the left and right

Press B to go back one screen at a time. Press Y to exit from any screen.

Ñ† DECK STRATEGY Ñ†
Ñ§---------------Ñ£
Remember that each deck consists of 15 cards, but only a random 10 of those are
dealt to you for each fight, and only a random 2 of those are available to you
at any one time. When building decks, try to stick with only 2 or 3 different
types of reifu and build strategies around them, rather than rely on
complicated strategies involving multiple types of cards that aren't very
likely to appear in the right order (or at all, for that matter).

I have included below some basic strategy for using and dealing with what I
have found to be the most commonly used cards in Wi-Fi matches. There are many
more cards that can be useful, and different characters benefit from different
deck strategies, but you'd do well to get accustomed to dealing with the 5
listed below.

SOUL UP (ç∞ÈÆ ÇtÇo)
Your standard healing card, gradually refills your life gauge for 2/3/4/5
seconds depending on the card level. You can't really go wrong with this one
unless you're either forced to use it when you already have full health or your
opponent uses a Soul Balance card after you heal.

FORCE REIFU USE (óÏïÑ ã≠êßégóp)
Probably the best all-around deck-breaker card. This forces the target to use
up all of his cards as quickly as possible, which can really mess up some deck
strategies.

It should be noted, however, that Force Reifu can be blocked. The effect only
forces the target to use up cards in situations where it is already possible to
use them. In other words, if the target is guarding or in the middle of an
attack while the Force Reifu effect is active, he will not use up any cards. If
he is in "Bankai Mode"--a situation in which most characters are not allowed to
use any cards normally--he will also not use up any cards. If the target
already currently using 2 cards, he will not use up any additional cards until
one of the 2 active ones is replaced. If you are hit with a Force Reifu card,
keep this information in mind.

The best time to use a Force Reifu card, in my experience, is when the opponent
has 2 or 3 reiatsu stock saved up in reserves. That way, when you strike him,
he'll automatically Damage Cancel out of your attack and waste both 1 reifu and
1 reiatsu stock in the process. If you see him use an Infinite Reiatsu card
while under the effect of a Force Reifu, FOLLOW UP WITH AN ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
if you are close enough (a stun move, or an attack with a long set-up and
execution, are the most ideal). Try not to let him negate the effect by going
into a Bankai super.

PROHIBIT GUARD (ÉKÅ[Éh ã÷é~)
Usually used in conjunction with an Infinite Reiatsu card and prevents the
target from blocking any attacks for a set amount of time. It's really hard to
deal with in some situations, and it's best to run away from the fight if it
looks like you're going to be overpowered. If you're hit with this but can
strike the opponent quickly, try to get him caught up in a long combo and wait
out the clock until you can guard again. If you have a full reiryoku bar, try
switching planes and playing keep-away.

INFINITE REIATSU (óÏà≥ ñ≥êsë†)
Grants the user a limitless number of reiatsu stock for a very short time
(.5/1/2/4 seconds depending on card level). Once the card expires, the user's
reiatsu stock is always reset to 0.

This card is typically used for an on-demand bankai super. If you see your
opponent use this, try to stall him long enough for the effect to pass by if
possible. Some throws last long enough for the level 1-3 versions of this card
to expire before your opponent has a chance to respond with a super. If you're
using this card and your opponent tries to stall you, Damage Cancel him if
possible (since you won't use up any reiatsu stock by doing so).

This card is often used in conjunction with a Guard Prohibit, which makes quite
a deadly combination. I don't find it to be particularly useful by itself,
however. Since the effect only lasts a few seconds at most before drying up,
you usually only have the opportunity to use a single 3-stock super before the
card expires, and if your opponent sees you use this card, he'll know that
you're planning to rush him with a super pretty soon. I prefer using Reiatsu Up
cards instead, as the effect is permanent and allows you to take your time and
decide when exactly you wish to use a super.

SOUL BALANCE (ç∞ÈÆ ïΩãœâª)
This card redistributes all players' life bars so that everyone has the exact
same amount of health. The card's effect is immediate, and it is immediately
replaced with another reifu after using it. Very useful, but there's a huge
drawback: if an opposing player uses a Force Reifu card while you have a Soul
Balance card available, you'll be forced into using it. Moreover, since the
Soul Balance card is immediately replaced, you'll also be forced into
Immediately using that card as well, which can be quite punishing. I typically
stick to Soul Up rather than Soul Balance since the former doesn't really have
any negative effects.

At the moment, my main decks are as follows:

SLOT A: Soul Up x10, Force Reifu Use x5
SLOT B: Infinite Reiatsu x8, Prohibit Guard x7
SLOT C: Soul Up x10, Reiatsu Up x5
SLOT D: Soul Up x10, Force Reifu Use x1, Soul Balance x4
SLOT E: I change this one around a lot for training and experimenting.

Level 2 cards cost 10x as much as level 1 cards, and level 3 cards cost 10x as
much as level 2 cards. Once you purchase every single level 1-3 card from the
shop, the level 4 cards that you have yet to earn will become available for
purchase. They cost quite a lot, at 200000 each.

Keep this in mind when collecting cards for use in your deck, as a level 3 or 4
version of some cards are not significantly better than their corresponding
level 1 versions and, thus, a pretty big waste of money. For example, the
Infinite Reiatsu card has a duration of 0.5 seconds at level 1 and 4 seconds at
level 4. Most bankai supers last longer than 4 seconds anyway, so there is no
use in spending a ton of money on the higher level version unless you really
want a lot of duplicates (which may or may not be a bad idea depending on your
deck strategy). 

Passwords can be entered to unlock a handful of level 4 cards. Five of these
passwords are entered with button combinations obtained from the Bleach GC
game, and three passwords are entered by drawing kanji on the touch screen.
Though I know the kanji used for the touch screen passwords, I unfortunately
cannot determine the exact manner in which you are supposed to draw them. A
Japanese magazine ("V JUMP BOOKS," I believe) supposedly contains pictures for
the touch screen passwords, which you are supposed to cut out, place over the
touch screen, and trace with the stylus. If anyone can provide scans of these
cut-outs or more information regarding them, please feel free to contact me.
