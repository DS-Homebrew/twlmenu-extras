{// 1.00 - minor update - December 29, 2009
  - School sort of killed me, so I didn't get to update as early as I'd have
    liked. Anyway, a few more errors and the like have been fixed. Added some
    Day 5 emails I was missing as well.

{// 1.00 - September 24, 2009
  - Gin's route is up, along with info on the optional Lucifer boss battle.
    And whoops, while I was editing I didn't fully correct the stuff on the
    Mari/Kudlak battles, so that should be fixed now. Also finished writing
    up all the Day 5 possible battles. Corrected other things.
  - Added a few more mini-sections under Nos. 6 and 7. Changed 28.
  - For now, this is the 'finished' version of the guide. When I have time,
    I'll probably add a few things like specific fusion lists, demons in the
    auction and their skills/etc, blah blah. There's also a few things I want
    to fix up. But this covers most of it.

{// 0.83 - September 1, 2009
  - Naoya's/Kaido's route is up. Finished the fusion stuff and database, and
    the skill lists. Fixed some typos and errors.
  - I tried putting in more notes to make some things a little more obvious,
    like "even if you follow the route outline, if you -don't answer dialogue
    questions and emails well, you won't unlock it-," and "if your demons
    aren't up to date you'll definitely be struggling," etc etc.

{// 0.70 - August 10, 2009
  - Slowly, unsteadily, but surely hacking this out. (I started a month ago,
    yeeeeah. Not that I, er, worked on it that long.)
  - First version up on GameFAQs. Info for Days 1-6 is up, along with Yuzu's,
    Atsuro's, and Amane's routes.
  - Next priority: Complete Skill List information, auction/demon things, 
    alternate Day 7 routes, advised fusions. ...When I get to formatting it 
    all, yeah I'm lazy. And If there's something I haven't included that you
    think would help the guide, please suggest it.

Hello, and thanks for reading this guide. I'm DS, or DarkenedSakura, and
basically a huge lurker at GameFAQs whom most of you probably haven't seen
before. (Not too keen on posting, what can I say...) I usually don't write
guides, but I figured that Devil Survivor would be the only game I'd ever get
soon enough where writing a nonredundant guide would be possible, so.

This is essentially my first gameplay guide, so this isn't going to be anywhere
near perfect. I will get to all the routes eventually, please be patient.
Otherwise, feel free to tell me anything I'm missing.

Essentially, this guide doesn't really give you every little step you have to
take. It'll indicate which events are mandatory for which routes, and battle
strategies are listed, but there's no concrete step-by-step walkthrough. What
events to do or not is up to you.

Oh, also. This guide's fairly spoiler-free...but there will obviously be
spoilery things in the battle sections and the "Route Spoilers" sections.
Fair warning.

email again, and please be understanding. :);;;

Uhmmmm and. Please don't complain to me about the pace at which I'm updating
this - I don't want to sound all "grr argh," but I've got a load of other
projects and various real life committments. It'll get done, I promise.

   { As He proclaimed...this world, created in seven days, shall be destroyed
     with the sounding of seven trumpets. You who have a will, fear the
     numbers your eyes shall see. Fear the time left... }

It's an ordinary day. You're supposed to be spending time with your friends,
Atsuro and Yuzu, and your cousin, Naoya. Instead, he gives you three modified
COMPs, or Communication Players, that suddenly summon demons and make the
three of you demon tamers. You also receive emails predicting the future, and
you can see "death clocks" above people's heads, a countdown to their deaths.

Soon after, Tokyo is put under lockdown, and you see that most people's clocks
are set to seven days - at the most. What's going to happen? Can you survive?


Devil Survivor is part of the Japanese Shin Megami Tensei franchise, by Atlus.
This particular SRPG sports a turn-based battle system, an events system where
you interact with various characters, and six alternate endings depending on
what events you've caused - or not.

Strategic maneuvering, against-the-clock event-pursuing, and what might be a
hellish Last Day - yeah, it can get addicting.

=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=

Names are listed in order of given name, family name (not the Japanese order).


(A) Main
    Age: 17
    Playable routes: all

The protagonist of the story. His name and dialogue are completely up to you - 
at least, given the options you get in the game. A bit of the silent type, and
good friends with Atsuro and Yuzu. His cousin, Naoya, lived with him for a 
while, and they're like brothers.

The MC is the only character whose stats you can completely customize.


(B) Atsuro Kihara
    Age: 17
    Email Handle: AT-LOW
    Playable routes: all

He's the main's best friend and high school classmate. Atsuro met Naoya online
through a forum, and is now his apprentice of sorts in learning about computer
programming. It's up to him throughout the game to figure out more about the
COMPs and handle the technological aspect of things. He puts up a strong front
especially when Yuzu freaks out, and he secretly confides to the MC that he
believes keeping demons around in the world wouldn't be so bad.

Atsuro's growths focus heavily on str/vit, and he'll be your strongest physical
attacker for most of the game. His magic's a bit lacking, however, but high
enough to give him some skill capacity variability. He has a movement range of
4. He's the only character besides the MC who'll stick around for every route.


(C) Yuzu Tanikawa
    Age: 17
    Email Handle: YUZ
    Playable routes: all except Naoya's

She's a childhood friend and high school classmate of the MC's, and spends a
lot of time yelling at Atsuro over her unwanted nickname of "Yoo-hoo." She's a
normal girl who just wants to get out of the lockdown and go home, go
shopping, have a boyfriend, have a life. Out of everyone, she voices the most
doubt and uncertainty, but holds herself together for the sake of the group.

To me, Yuzu gets a weird rap on the boards. She's not that bad, you know?
She's pretty normal, reacting to the lockdown the way she does, and reacts
better than a lot of people would. In our humble opinions, haha.

Yuzu has some of the best magic growths in the game, and a high starting speed
of 53. Her weak point, however, is a meager movement range of 3. Nothing you
can't fix with certain demons, however.


(D) Naoya
    Age: 24
    Email handle: NAOYA
    Playable routes: Naoya's, Kaido's

He lost his parents at an early age and lived with the MC's family, until he
moved out and got his own apartment in Aoyama a few years ago. He's like a
brother to the MC.

Naoya's a genius programmer, as Atsuro constantly reminds the group. He sends
the three of them COMPs at the beginning of the game, but what are his real
reasons for doing so...?

Naoya has very strong magic like Yuzu. His agility's slightly lower, but his
vitality's higher. He has a movement range of 4. On his and Kaido's routes,
he'll be a great replacement for Yuzu.


(E) Keisuke Takagi
    Age: 17
    Email handle: K-T
    Playable routes: all except Naoya's

Atsuro was good friends with him in middle school, though they lost touch
afterwards. According to Atsuro, he always "looked out for the little guy."
Quiet and reserved, Keisuke's thoughtful and observant, and along with Atsuro
furthers many of the group's theories about their situation. Still, everyone
has a snapping point, and after certain lines are crossed, Keisuke is no
exception...

Keisuke has high agility and a speed of 55. His magic's favored over his
strength and his defense/vitality is somewhat low. He has a movement range of
4.


(F) Midori Komaki
    Age: 15
    Email handle: DOLLY
    Playable routes: all except Naoya's

A famous camgirl on the internet who goes by the name of Dolly, she's liked by
guys and girls alike for her easygoing and nice attitude. She's easily
recognizable due to her anime cosplay outfit. When she gets her hands on a
COMP, she's excited to play the hero and save people...but her refusal to see
certain truths causes more problems than she realizes. Being a hero in the
lockdown isn't so straightforward...

Midori's magic is a little bit lower than Yuzu's and her strength's about the
same, but her vitality's higher and she has a movement range of 4.


(F) Yoshino "Haru" Harusawa
    Age: 20
    Email handle: n/a
    Playable routes: none

Haru's the lead vocalist for D-Va, an indie rock band. The band's on hiatus
due to one of their members having left, but Haru still plays on the street
during the lockdown. Music's her everything; 

She carries around a sequencer left to her by her teacher, but it seems to be
more connected with demon summoning than anyone thought...

While she's often a civilian that you'll have to protect during fights, no, she
isn't a playable character. It's too bad. ): If she was a fighter, her eventual
stats would've been incredible (best magic in the game, plus an insane amount
of HP), too.


(G) Eiji "Gin" Kamiya
    Age: 25
    Email handle: GIN
    Playable routes: only Gin's

Gin runs a bar in Omotesando, "Eiji," and acts as a guardian for Haru. Yuzu
says that everyone thinks of him as a big brother figure of sorts. All he wants
is for Tokyo to go back to the way it was - without demons - the vibrant,
lively city that Aya loved and he grew to love as well.

His lover went missing six months ago. Without her influence, he would've been
a much different kind of guy. Searching for answers in the middle of the
lockdown, Gin will need your help to find out just what happened to her and
where she is.

Gin's stats are probably the most balanced out of everyone's, leaning slightly
towards strength and vitality. But yeah, incredibly balanced, which makes his
skill range very diverse and allows him to provide good support. He has a
movement range of 4 and a Speed of 52.


(H) Tadashi "Kaido" Nikaido
    Age: 19
    Email handle: NIKAIDO
    Playable routes: Kaido's, Naoya's

Kaido's the well-known leader of the Shibuya Daemons, a "charismatic gang" of
sorts. He doesn't really want to lead them, though, as to him some of the
notions are a pain - but he does it for the sake of his older brother, the
former leader. Kaido just wants the power to defend those important to him, 
and will do anything to get it.

Kaido has high strength, much higher than Atsuro's, and higher vitality as
well. However, he has low agility and basically nonexistant magic. He has a
movement range of 4 and a Speed of 47. I honestly prefer Atsuro to him because
of the former's better agility, magic defense, and versatility, but if you want
brute strength, Kaido's your guy.


(I) Yasuyuki Honda
    Age: 29
    Email handle: YASHON
    Playable routes: none

A typical Tokyo office worker - or is he? - Honda got stuck in the lockdown and
desperately wants to get out to be at his son's side during his surgery. He
becomes a companion of Kaido's. You'll cross paths with him several times,
and perhaps even on some of the routes...


(J) Mari Mochizuki
    Age: 23
    Email handle: n/a
    Playable routes: all except Yuzu's

An elementary school nurse, Mari was Atsuro's former tutor. She was childhood
friends with Kaido and his brother. After the first of the bloodless killings,
she's never been able to get over her companion's death. With the lockdown and
the demons, she might be able to do something about it at last.

Mari has slightly less magic and agility than Yuzu, but far more vitality. Her
speed's 53 and she has a movement range of 4.


(K) Amane Kuzuryu
    Age: 16
    Email handle: AMANE
    Playable routes: Amane's, Gin's

The daughter of the founder, the Shomonkai's maiden speaks with a charismatic
gravitas that attracts people to the cause. However, she doesn't seem to agree
entirely with everything the Shomonkai advocates, and she might also have a few
beings - angelic, or demonic? - residing in her. With her strong belief in God,
Amane really would like nothing better than for you to become the next Messiah,
spread His teachings all over the world, and so on.

Amane has a little more magic than Yuzu, but lower strength and far lower
agility (it'll be a while before she can use Ma-dyne magic). More of a magic
tank than a magic blitzer. She has a movement range of 3.


(L) Azuma

He's one of the top Shomonkai officials and Amane's protectors. Though he's
little more than a member of the Shomonkai, he knows and caused a few things
that at least one of your friends is desperate to know.


(M) Founder

Amane's father, the founder of Shomonkai seems to have a strong disagreement
with his daughter about something important. His intentions and beliefs might
be the cause of more than you could have guessed.


(N) Misaki Izuna
    Age: 26
    Email handle: n/a
    Playable routes: Atsuro's, Gin's

She's a member of a special government unit deployed to deal with lockdown-
related things. And, yeah, her mission's her priority - she'll kill you if
she'll have to, considering all the lives on the line. Don't push it. She
values the goals of the mission over pride or the usual tactics, so she'll
provide you help and support when needed, sometimes.

Izuna has impressive Strength, Vitality, and Agility. No magic whatsoever,
though, but still easily one of the best physical fighters in the game. She has
a movement of 4.


(O) Shoji

A journalist who got caught in the lockdown, she's investigating the reasons
for the lockdown and everything else to do with it. She'll provide you some
helpful information once in a while.


(P) ???

Aka, the flashy gigolo guy. He seems to know Naoya, but never elucidates on why
he does, or why he knows so much about the Bels and their war. He seems pretty
interested in you and how far you'll go, though...but who is he?


(Q) Black Frost
    Age: n/a
    Email handle: n/a
    Playable routes: Gin's, Kaido's, Naoya's

If you manage to see the scene where Midori teaches a Jack Frost about the
power of love and magical punishment, later on in the game you might get to
encounter Black Frost, a souped-up Jack Frost who's trying to protect some of
his fellow demons from getting slaughtered.

Black Frost has pretty much balanced stats, leaning more towards magic, then
strength. He has a movement of three. The main point in using him is that he
has natural resistances - reflect to fire and ice. However, he's also weak to
force.

{// A: Mission/battle system ............
                                  .................................. [0602] //}

Devil Survivor is an SRPG, or strategy role-playing game. Missions have
criteria for victory or defeat. You only have to meet one of the victory
requirements to win; likewise, you only have to fail one of the defeat criteria
to lose. The battles are turn-based and fought on grids peppered with different
elevation levels and obstacles.

On your character's turn, you can move, fight, use a skill that you or your
demon has, return a demon to your inventory, or summon a new demon (you can do
this to replace a demon whose HP went down to 0, too). Every action you take
adds a little to your speed bar of sorts. The fuller it is (compared to
everyone else's), the farther back your next turn will be in the order (which
you can see in the little bar of characters at the top).

Battles themselves are turn-based; choose which action you want (Attack, Guard,
and up to three Command Skills), and fight. Turn order is based on agility.

Victory requirements vary; sometimes you have to protect a civilian/civilians,
sometimes you can't let one of your characters die (normally, if this happens,
you can revive them again, but in some battles if they run out of HP, that's
it), sometimes you'll only have to defeat a boss to win.

   NOTE: Just going to stick this bit of advice here. If you're ever having
         a really hard time with the game even if your team leaders' levels
         are fine, it's because you forgot about your demons. Always keep
         them up to date - that's why you can fuse. Demons level up much
         slower than your team leaders, so keeping them around for a long
         time is not viable.


{ // B: Extra Turn ......................
                                  .................................. [0603] //}

Unique to the Megami Tensei series is the Extra Turn system. By hitting an
enemy's elemental weakness or landing a critical hit, you'll give your fighter
an "extra turn." After the initial turn, all characters who've scored the
extra turn option will act once more in a second turn of sorts. In addition to
scoring extra turns, you can make your opponents' extra turns disappear if you
hit them with crits/weaknesses. Likewise, the same can happen to you.


{// C: Fighting stats ...................
                                  .................................. [0604] //}

When you or a demon levels up, one of four possible stats that affect your
performance in battle will increase. You can only choose which stats will
increase when for the MC - all other characters' stat increases are
predetermined.

For characters in your party, stats also affect which types of skills they can
equip.

Strength: affects the strength of "Attack" and any physical damage-dealing
          move.
Magic:    affects the strength of any elemental MP-costing magic attack, and
          the amount of MP a character has. Also factors into magic defense.
Vitality: affects the amount of HP and physical defense a character has.
Agility:  determines how soon a character will attack in battle, and the
          likelihood of getting Extra Turns.

Stats alone don't determine damage factors, as your level also plays a part in
how much damage you deal and receive.


{// D: Recommended MC stats? ............
                                  .................................. [0605] //}

It depends. Yeah, cheap answer, I know. Most players favor a Main with high
Magic, as you'll have the ability to wipe out most things on your own later on
in the game. A magic nuke with high mag and agi could wipe out most things on
the first turn and take advantage of Almighty skills, for example.

If it's your first playthrough, personally, I would advise you to raise your
strength more in the beginning, as you won't have many skills cracked for your
Magic stat to take advantage of (one of the reasons why Yuzu's not quite as
useful in the beginning, but can be a monster later on). Still, after a day or
so, you don't have to bother with it so much. Decide which passives you want
your MC to equip - Null Phys, for example, requires 13 Str. Null Fire, good for
the Day 6 18:00 fight, requires 11 Str.

And by the time you get to 2nd/3rd Day or so, you should be liberally raising
Magic whenever possible.

Personally, I favor agility in whatever game I play. Watch the monsters you
fight to see if you're increasing it too much, though - after a certain point
it's unnecessary.

I know I've neglected to say anything about Vitality. I never really bothered
with it unless I needed a certain skill equipped.

So, in short: magic, agility, strength/vitality. If you want to play it safer,
go more vitality than agility. Just don't keep your stats 100% balanced -
by the end you'll be too flimsy in Strength or Magic to do what Atsuro and
Yuzu can with Deathbound and -dyne spells, and you'll have other balanced
characters who can take care of skill versatility in your party.

And you -can- play as a strength-oriented MC. But since you have Atsuro (and
Kaido, and Izuna, and Gin, potentially) and there are more magic skills/setups
than phys. ones, it's honestly not the best choice.


{// E: Skills ...........................
                                  .................................. [0606] //}

Devil Survivor has no items or whatnot. The only way for you to do anything is
with skills. They'll let you attack, defend, up resistance, whatever. Your
character's stats determine which skills they can equip.

Towards the middle of the 1st Day, you gain the ability to Skill Crack, aka get
the abilities of demons you defeat. You have to select which skill you want and
have that specific character defeat that specific demon. Obviously, you can't
crack two skills off of one individual demon during a battle, and only one
Skill Crack per character per battle.

Note that you don't have to have the stats to equip a specific skill to be able
to crack it.

As the game states, you don't have to crack a skill with a certain character to
have them use it; just go to the menu and directly choose who uses what (Y
button).

There are four types of skills in the game: Command, Passive, Racial, and Auto.

Command: lets you take action in battle (i.e. magic, phys. attack, healing,
         status effects, defense/reflect/null attacks).
Passive: primarily defense/support oriented (i.e. elemental resistances,
         increased crit rates, possible status infliction, 2x attack).
Racial:  demons only. Each demon race (Fairy, Kishin, Jaki, Gemna...) has a
         unique ability (i.e. increased movement/attack range, ranged healing,
         MP recovery, crit rate increase.)
Auto:   tamers only. Kicks in at the beginning of/during battle (i.e. increased
         evade/attack/defense, halved MP cost, healing, null element attack).


{// F: Macca bonus/magnetite ............
                                  .................................. [0607] //}

Early in the game, these two elements are unlocked. Macca bonus is, well, what
it sounds like - a monetary bonus you get at the end of each particular fight/
skirmish with a demon team within a battle. Magnetite allows you to assign one
of the demons on your team a skill that you've cracked, once you build up
enough of it. Command skills only - no passives allowed, alas.

Both are influenced by how well you fight in battle. The more seamlessly and
efficiently you fight, the better your bonus, and the more your magnetite 'bar'
gets charged.

Note that there's no way to look up the magnetite level of your characters.
Eventually, you'll get a little message saying it's full. Fight more
efficiently, and it'll come around more often. That's all there is to it.

=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=

{// A: Timed events .....................
                                  .................................. [0702] //}

In Devil Survivor, you move from location to location via a list of areas in
the Yamanote circle. There's no movement cost, but if you choose an event, 30
minutes will pass. Events have little clock symbols next to them, and areas 
with possible events have the same clock symbol, so you can't miss them.


{// B: Plot, battles and routes .........
                                  .................................. [0703] //}

Battles are only one kind of event that makes time pass; events where you speak
with various characters are another. Some of these events are required; most
go toward unlocking one of the game's six possible character-oriented routes. 
Choosing one event will usually lead to another appearing on the map.

It's possible to unlock all six routes in one playthrough (there's a guide you
can find by searching the boards if you want a walkthrough). However, you can
only do one route per playthrough, anyway, and the decision only kicks in on
the 7th and final day).

Again, any kind of battle shows up with a red "!", next to both its name and
the area's name in the list. Free battles take up no time.

The possible routes are as follows:

   Amane
   Atsuro
   Gin
   Kaido
   Naoya
   Yuzu

Kaido's and Naoya's routes are more or less the same, following the King of
Demons path.

Yuzu's path is a default path. No matter what you do, it'll be available.

   NOTE: In addition to events, there's a bit of a point system that
         tallies up additional things like how you answer dialogue
         choices. This system - aka, how you answer dialogue, does affect
         which routes get unlocked as well. Just picking all the events
         applicable to a route will not unlock it.


{// C: Blue events ......................
                                  .................................. [0704] //}

One final note - blue events don't show up on your area list, and don't take up
time. They usually supply extra information or something that'll help you get
one of the routes, however, so you'll have to keep an eye out for them.


{// D. Which route should I...? .........
                                  .................................. [0705] //}

Seems like a lot of first-time players really want to know the answer to this
one. There's obviously no one, perfect answer, but here's a few ideas.

 - Beat the game on Yuzu's route. You'll get all the bonuses of New Game+
   (sans the movement range of 5 for the MC) and unlock several fusions that
   will make the other routes more manageable. This route is the easiest.
   In all the other routes, -you have to fight all/most of the Bels, the Devas,
   and Babel-. So unless you really don't want to play this game twice, I'd
   recommend Yuzu's route first to save yourself the grindfest.
 - Otherwise, Atsuro's and Amane's will be moderate challenges.
 - Despite the hype, the following are doable: go for Gin's or Naoya's/Kaido's
   routes. Hard? Yes. Grindfest at times? Maybe. Final/penultimate levels make
   you want to tear your hair out? Maybe. But they're not impossible...just
   drastically easier (and not as time-intensive) on New Game+.

Overall, don't freak out about it. If you're really bent on not replaying this
game, then...well, why are you limiting yourself? New Game+ goes by a lot
faster, as it's designed to help you see more options you naturally couldn't
get to the first time while reducing grind time.

Anyway, done opinionating. Carry on.


{// E. Last Day comparisons .............
                                  .................................. [0706] //}

For a more specific (and obviously spoilery) rundown of just what the different
Last Days for each route entails, battle-wise, look below.

Events-wise, Atsuro's and Gin's are scene-heavy. Yuzu's is...almost entirely
scenes. You can fight the optional, very difficult boss battle during all
routes except Yuzu's, if you're on New Game+.

Amane
 - Jezebel
 - Bishamon, Koumoku, Zouchou
 - Belzebub
 - Naoya; Loki (aka, two annoyingly powerful Megidolaon users)
 - Belberith
 - Babel
   -- Bel gauntlet - refighting all the past Bels (including Beldr and Belial)

Atsuro
 - Naoya (try to catch him, he runs all over the place)
 - Bishamon, Koumoku, Zouchou
 - Belzebub
 - Belberith
 - Babel
   -- Phase one - You'll have to escort someone who's not defenseless but lacks
      a demon team. Atsuro is required, and will be out of commission for the
      last half (once you access the console)
   -- Phase two - Three Gate/elemental forms

Gin
 - Jezebel
 - Bishamon, Koumoku, Zouchou
 - Belzebub
 - Belberith
 - Babel
   -- Phase one - You'll have to escort someone who's entirely defenseless.
      Atsuro is required, and will be out of commission for the last half (once
      you access the console)
   -- Phase two - Three Gate/elemental forms...and, most of all, your demons
      are all gone - yep, your team leaders fight this one solo (Babel's level
      and resistance do go down slightly, though)

Kaido/Naoya
 - Believers, Amane (a huge Evil/Chaos Wave'ing horde)
 - Jezebel
 - Bishamon, Koumoku, Zouchou
 - Belzebub
 - Aniels, Kazfiels, Sariel, Anael
 - Belberith
 - Babel
   -- Bel gauntlet - refighting all the past Bels (including Beldr and Belial)

Yuzu
 - Loki (and Laksmis to Skill Crack off of)
 - Aniels, Kazfiels, Sariel, Anael; Amane, Izuna

=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=

Like some other SMT games, after you beat it the first time, you can create
a New Game+ file. When you play the game again, you'll get the following:

 - All Skill Cracks carry over.
 - All Macca carries over.
 - All demons carry over. (Yeah, no joke.)
 - Your auction rating carries over (and with it, auction levels - Gold, etc).
 - Unlocked fusions carry over.
 - The level limit for fusions is no more.
 - There will be no experience penalty where you get less EXP from defeating
   lower-level demons. Basically, grinding? Becomes a lot easier and less
   time-consuming. If you even need to.
 - The character whose route you beat appears on the title screen.
   (If you beat Kaido's route, you'll unlock Naoya's picture. And if you beat
    Gin's route, you'll get Gin and Haru's pictures.)
 - There's an optional boss on the Last Day.

Also, the MC can get certain boosts:
 - If you beat Yuzu's route, you'll start with a movement of 4 and Speed of 53.
 - If you beat any other route, you'll start with a movement of 5 and Speed of
   56.
 - These don't stack (i.e. you beat the game twice, you won't have 59-62 Speed
   or a movement of 6 or whatever).

Yeah, without New Game+, enjoying all the different endings wouldn't be quite
as easy or fun. And it's so awesome to see your endgame demons deal around
3,000 damage to the beginning demons...

Anyway, here's where the game begins.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A note on the guide structure:

For the rest of the days, the info I have will be split up into an events
section (A), which goes through the events you have access to etc etc, and a
battle section (B), which details all the storyline battles you'll fight that
day.

I'm not including free battles. It's information that I don't think most people
will need - if the enemies are challenging (especially for the non-hard free
battle), you're doing something wrong with your battle strategy/team setups,
not paying attention to weaknesses, etc. The rule of thumb is, fight enough of
them per day so that you can skill crack everything available to you.


The events section will vary depending on what you choose in the game. For
example, say the schedule lists a Gin event on Day 3, but you don't choose it.
The event will carry over into the next day, etc etc, but I'm not listing that
event under the Day 4 event flowchart. I'm trying to only list events that
appear for the first time on that day, but this system isn't perfect and the
locations of events might change (this happened to me with Honda once), so bear
with me.

This guide doesn't give you a step-by-step "do this event at xx time."
Mandatory events and event trees for routes are indicated instead.

Also, one kinda important pre-game reminder, again:

     Your dialogue choices in the game? Important. In addition to various
     specific ones that influence major plot points, a lot of it will affect
     the routes you can get on the 6th Day. Keep it in mind.

It's an easy, "hey what's up" kind of day to get you oriented with the game.
Two easy battles, few event choices, and lots of questions with no answers.
So far.


{ // A. Events ...........................
                                   ................................ [0902]} //}

Available areas: Shinjuku, Aoyama, Harajuku, Omotesando, Shibuya, Ebisu.

Key:
* - Event cannot be skipped.
    (Note that all [BATTLE]s by their nature are plot-oriented and cannot be
     skipped, unless [OPTIONAL] is indicated.)

16:00
 - ??? (Founder) - Shinjuku                  <-- Amane route

 - Atsuro - Shibuya
   -- I honestly don't think this will
      do anything route-wise, so. Might
      contribute points to getting
      Atsuro's route, though.

16:30
 - Yuzu - Omotesando*                        <-- And everything else is plot.

17:00
 - Residential Area - Aoyama*

17:30
 - Atsuro - Shibuya [BATTLE]

18:30
 - Residential Area - Aoyama*

19:00
 - Cemetary - Aoyama [BATTLE]


Emails:
Atsuro
"Teach Yuzu for me."
"I'm tired, too." <-- +Atsuro


It doesn't really matter which of the first two events you pick. I never chose
the Azuma option and got Amane's route, etc. And I'm fairly sure that the
Atsuro one doesn't do anything. They might contribute points to each
character's route, so it's up to you.


{ // B. Battles ..........................
                                   ................................ [0903]} //}

   { Atsuro - Shibuya - 17:30 }

Enemies:
Pixie Lv: 2
Kobold Lv: 1
Kabuso Lv: 2


The demons start off by attacking. Just attack, really nothing to it. If you're
having problems right now, well, I'm not sure. The MC and Atsuro should have no
problems with their battles, while Yuzu's might take a little longer. Let her
defeat her demon, though, for the EXP.

You'll earn about 35 EXP and 50 Macca at the end.

After the battle, you'll be able to see people's death clocks.

Leaving the current setup of Pixie - Yuzu, Kobold - Main, and Kabuso - Atsuro
should work fine. Same with skills (Dia, Agi, and Zio).



   { Cemetary - Aoyama - 19:00 }

Victory:
Defeat all demons

Defeat:
Main, Atsuro, & Yuzu die

Required:
Atsuro's dispatchment
Yuzu's dispatchment

Enemies:
Ogre Lv: 3, Pixie Lv: 2
Kobold Lv: 3, Kobold Lv: 3
Kobold Lv: 3
Ogre Lv: 3, Kobold Lv: 3
Wendigo Lv: 19

Other:
Priestess Lv: 31

Don't freak out about the Wendigo. The Priestess's turn comes before it, and
one Maragi from her will reduce its HP to 1, causing it to flee the battle.
She'll also give chase, leaving the EXP and fightable enemies to you.

Again, this battle shouldn't be too hard. Take care of the Pixie before it
heals anyone, spam Agi (on the Pixie and Kobolds) and Zio (on the Ogres), and
have Yuzu and Pixie heal if necessary.

You'll earn about 50 EXP and 150 Macca at the end.

=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=

You're introduced to several new things today, like most of the game's
characters, the devil auction, the Cathedral of Shadows (demon fusion), Skill
Crack, free battles, and so on. Your death clock's also at 0, so you're going
to have to fight for your lives today.

Where to begin?


{ // A. Events ...........................
                                   ................................ [1002]} //}

Free battle available at Shibuya.
After 13:00, free battle available at Shinjuku.
After 16:30, another free battle available at Suidobashi (hard).

At Shinjuku, choose "Listen to people here" to receive 50 Macca.

For the most part, all of the events today are forced - time can't be skipped
nearly all day, and there's enough time for all events. The exception is 9:00 -
9:30, where you must forgo one event. It's recommended you avoid Yuzu's, as
her route is the default anyway.

Now is a good idea to fight free battles to keep up your party's level, and,
when you get the ability, to Skill Crack. Fighting enough free battles until
you crack everything you can should be enough to keep you leveled up.

A lot of people seem to have trouble with this battle, but it can be pretty
straightforward if you take the right steps. First, all of your teams should
have two demons each. As you just received Skill Crack, you should go and fight
a free battle or two at Shibuya until you've cracked everything you can, which
will give you skills and EXP.

Next, you absolutely do not want to get swarmed or separate your teams. It'll
hurt. Take care of the Waira and Kabuso teams to your immediate bottom-right.
Don't advance towards Wendigo until that's done.

You'll want to crack Wendigo's Anti-Ice as it's handy to have this early. I
used Yuzu as my main attacker, and put Agi and Zan on her. Gang up on Wendigo
and kill the Moh Shuyuu first with Zan before they get in the way. Constantly
heal with Dia and Charm. At this point my MC had slightly higher strength, so I
let him attack while saving his MP for Dia. Or you can put Dia on Yuzu and Zan
on the MC, whichever way works best. As you probably know by now, your Pixie's
rather fragile, so be careful with it.

Once you get Wendigo down to maybe 1/3 HP, it'll start running away. It can't
run off the field, though, so don't worry about it – pursue it leisurely (or
Bind it with Ogre if you must), and Wendigo will eventually double back. At
least, that's what happened when I fought it. Don't forget about the demons
that start behind it, either, especially the Pixie with Charm/Dia. You probably
want to kill those quickly – if you kill Wendigo first, some of them will leave
the battle. Might as well get the EXP while you can, right?

Since you can't fuse yet and have limited options, just be at a good level,
move cautiously, and you should be okay.

You'll receive about 100 EXP and 70 Macca at the end.

Waira Lv: 7, Waira Lv: 7, Waira Lv: 7
Ogun Lv: 8, Bilwis Lv: 10, Ogun Lv: 8


This is pretty much your first taste of a save-the-civilian sort of battle.
In short, it'd be a good idea to have demons in your teams that have Devil
Speed, Animal Leg, etc, that'll give you more movement. Basically, having a
Waira or two would really help things out. Having a Pixie with Charm will also
be helpful, in case you need to heal Haru.

So. Have two members work on taking out enemies close by, and at the same time,
have someone with Devil Speed rush over to Haru. You'll have about two or three
turns before the Waira team by her significantly weakens her and you'll really
need to heal her. And watch out for the pesky Bilwis team at the top left - it
has two Jakis that can Bind you and lower your movement to 1 if you get within
three spaces of it.

You'll receive about 110 EXP and 85 Macca at the end.

Hm, more standard fare. The battle introduces the red demon-generating squares,
but they don't really pump out any reinforcements in this battle. You can stand
on them and pick up the COMPs causing them if you want, but as it's a waste of
time, don't bother.

The Bilwis teams won't move unless you get maybe within 1-2 spaces of them. The
Waira team, on the other hand, is all too happy to use Devil Speed to get to
you. Standard battling strategies apply here - don't get ganged up on, slowly
and methodically eliminate teams, hit weaknesses, etc etc. If you think a lone
team's strong enough to take on a Bilwis team on its own, by all means;
otherwise, mass them in a big group.

You'll receive about 140 EXP and 105 Macca at the end.

Options that do affect your route coverage are starting to appear. Kaido's
event in Kanda is triggered by two separate events - one of which is a required
battle, meaning the other is thusly a non-required event.

If an event has "priority," it means that other events with that person will
disappear from the map until the priority event's done.

   NOTE: Several events do appear after battles. If you're the kind of person
         who likes to do as many events as possible before the mandatory
         battles (like me), change your habit, or you'll miss certain events.

Nearly all of the teams are made up of a pair of the same demon, so they'll
have the same weaknesses. Take advantage of it and stack your teams accordingly
with the right elemental spells (especially if you have any Ma- or Dance ones).

There's one tamer with Evil Wave who can attack you from two squares away.
Luckily, you can reach him in the first turn and take out his Toubyou partner,
keeping him from doing so.

The best thing about this battle is that it's a tamer battle, meaning you have
the opportunity to crack Auto Skills. For this battle (and all others), you'll
want to prioritize Auto Skill cracking since they're relatively rare. Thus, get
all three of the ones you can find here while you can.

You'll receive about 240 EXP and 135 Macca at the end.

After three turn rotations or so (for the enemies), a reinforcement Bilwis team
should appear. There probably won't be enough time for more than two of them to
show up, though, so it's not a big deal.

There's not much to this battle. The three Gagyson teams won't move or attack,
so eliminate them at will. It'll be easier to get to the first Gagyson behind
the railing near where you start out if you have someone with Phantasma or
Flight, if you want this to go quicker.

You'll receive about 160 EXP and 115 Macca at the end.

This battle shouldn't be too challenging. What might be harder is grabbing as
much EXP as you can before Kaido and Honda take it all. They should be quite a
few levels higher than you, and won't have a problem with the map. So, race
over there and wipe out what you can.

Reinforcements will spawn once in a while at the corners of the map. They're
all random assortments of Gagyson teams, but they shouldn't be too bad. The
biggest threat in this level is probably the Toubyous with Evil Wave, and the
swarms of Jack Frosts and Lilims who'll use Charm and Devotion. Again, it
shouldn't be too much trouble - keep some Bufu and Agi spells in reserve, hit
the Toubyous quickly, and you'll be done.

You'll receive about 220 EXP and 125 Macca at the end.

Oh, look, the first of many save-the-civilian battles to come. And if you think
this one's a pain...well, the others probably won't get any better. Unless you
approach them strategically.

With all save-civilian battles, abilities that'll let you get to where they are
quickly will save the day. So, Devil Speed, Switch, and even Flight and
Phantasma (which reduces wait time if you're just moving around) to a degree
will help. You -can- Switch with NPCs, so that makes it easy to a) get to one
end of the map quickly and b) get the civilians closer to the exit. Bind will
stop enemies from being able to follow fleeing civilians, as well.

You'll also want ranged mass-heal abilities like Charm, Devotion, or Affection.
The civilians will ultimately end up getting damaged a little, and if you can't
Switch them or defeat the enemies in one turn, you'll want to heal them. The
requirement "A citizen dies" does not mean the team of three civilians - if a
single one of them goes down to 0 HP, it's game over. So keep that in mind.

So, for this battle, Devil Speed/Switch your way down the bridge. The Gagyson
team has Devil Speed, so you'll want to go after it first. Heal the civilians,
kill any demon team that tries to escape at the top, and the hardest part of
this will be over soon enough.

You'll receive about 260 EXP and 150 Macca at the end.

Keisuke might pose a slight problem here, as he's apt to get swarmed and, well,
die. So you're going to have to rush over to him, keep him healed, and take
everything out. Midori will keep moving towards the underground escape tile,
so if you keep things from getting too close to her, she should be okay.

The usual strategy of Devil Speed/Flight applies (Switch isn't as helpful as
he's not an escaping civilian, though you could preserve more EXP this way).
All of the Evil Wave-ing Toubyous will start to get really annoying really
soon, so gang up on them to kill them asap.

You'll receive about 280 EXP and 170 Macca at the end.

Welcome to the most nonsensical battle of the game. In short, make your way up
the steps (with something like Devil Speed, Flight, or Phantasma, preferably),
and have all of your party members stand next to one COMP. Don't analyze just
yet. As Ghost Q said at the beginning, it's a game – two of the containers are
fake, and one's real. If you get a fake one, which seems to happen for the
first two containers all the time, a Ghost Q will replace the container. At
your current level, yeah, you could get slaughtered.

If your party analyzes in one go, you should be able to evade damage. The other
option is to spend a turn standing next to the containers, then analyze. You'll
then be able to move, and the Ghost Qs won't pursue you if you're not in their
range. Strange, but yes.

The real container has 999 Macca in it, though you could get other prizes too
such as Skill Cracks and the like.

Overall, this isn't really a battle worth fighting – you can get the EXP and
Macca through free battles, you can't crack anything off of Ghost Q, and it
uses up a precious 30 minutes that you could be using to get yourself on
another route. Don't bother.

I got 20 EXP as the end battle bonus. I assume that if you defeat Ghost Q you
could get more, but then you'll miss out on the Macca...which was the point,
right?

Toubyou Lv: 15, Toubyou Lv: 15, Toubyou Lv: 15


With Haru way up on the stage and all the monsters much closer to her than you
are to them, yeah, it'll be a race. The usual save-the-civilian strategies
apply, and Devil Speed, Flight, and Phantasm will be incredibly useful here.
Actually, I doubt you'll be able to make it on time without them. You'll also
want a ranged healing ability for Haru's sake, as a demon or two will probably
get to her first.

Otherwise, that's about it. You've got a lot of annoying Toubyou with Evil Wave
and enemy teams that can usually be taken out with either Ma-/Dance Bufu- or
Agi-type skills, so take advantage of those weaknesses. And be wary of the
Wendigos' Bind, as it can be quite irritating if you don't take them out.

You'll receive about 360 EXP and 210 Macca at the end.

Not too bad a battle at first. Race towards the civilians and Midori with the
usual Devil Speed/Flight/Switch options, heal them as needed, let the civilians
escape southwards, etc etc.

The fun part's when you kill all the demons, as Beldr emerges from the ground
in some...strange metal-adorned fashion, and unleashes Vampire Mist. It targets
everyone on the field and does Mystic-type damage that'll partially heal him.
And he's a bit immortal (note that racial skill and those Nulls, there), so you
really have no choice but to run. He's got a move of 3, so if you have someone
Bind him once or twice, there really shouldn't be any problem.

Beldr appears at the top of the field, so you can arrange your team accordingly
so that most of them are out of harm's way. You -will- have to fight Beldr once
to find out his immortal-ness for yourself, though. Letting Midori attack him
will work - you'll just have to cover for her a little more, as your teams
can't escape before she does. The reinforcements are fairly high-
leveled, so don't underestimate them. If they're too tough, just flee asap.


You'll receive about 400 EXP and 240 Macca at the end.

The monsters will ignore you in favor of Midori and the lone citizen, so run on
over (or amble, if you want to lose EXP) and attack when convenient. It's
another good battle for multi-strike skills that hit weaknesses, so.

This is an optional battle. It's required for unlocking Black Frost (the event
with the Frost doesn't appear until after this battle), so yeah, up to you.
Note that you can only use Black Frost on Naoya's and Amane's routes.

You'll receive about 200 EXP at the end.

Silky Lv: 24, Honda Lv: 28, Cait Sith Lv: 25


Okay, this battle's a little more unique. There are seven enemy teams in all -
the Yuki Jyorou team appears after a turn or so - and you'll have to defeat
four of them if you don't want to lose the mission and your COMPs, thanks to
that challenge that Yuzu made. Kaido and Honda get to attack first, plus their
attacks more often than not target the leaders, meaning they'll quickly rack up
kills.

You might as well restart the battle if Honda kills the first enemy team all on
his own, as catchup could be tricky. If Kaido uses Double Hit, he'll get pushed
way down in the attack order and you won't have to worry about him moving for a
while. Flight/Phantasm/Devil Speed your way up the map. If you're having
serious speed issues, aim for the team leaders only - that's all that counts.

The Yuki Jyorou reinforcement appears on the lower level where the Pyro Jack
is, so you'll want someone with Flight to go down there, or just someone who'll
go down the stairs at the start. You'll probably be able to kill those teams
before Kaido ever manages to get down there, so if you can kill two other
teams, you're set.

Whenever you kill four teams, Kaido and Honda will be swept out of the battle
and you get to take care of whatever demons are left at your own leisurely
pace.

You'll receive about 410 EXP and 270 Macca at the end.

Hey, another one of those rare tamer battles, providing Blitzkrieg and Fortify
free(-ish) for the taking. The former ups attack by 25% and the latter defense
by 25%, so you want those skills.

Nearly all of the teams should be reachable in your first turn. If you have
someone with Flight or Devil Speed, you'll be able to get to the teams on the
left. You might want to get rid of those first, as 1) Chaos Wave is a pain and
2) allies will appear after two enemy teams have been killed/two turns have
gone by/something like that. And you know how irritating it is when someone
else kills what you're trying to Skill Crack.

You'll earn about 450 EXP and 310 Macca at the end.

The tamers will go after the demons first. Be careful when fighting them - once
defeated, they'll become civilians that can die and make you fail the mission.
So, you'll want to eliminate most of the demons first. Shouldn't be too much of
a problem as they're all closer to you anyway.

The real annoyance in this battle's from the tamer teams, as two of them have
Chaos Wave. You can let the demons weaken them or whatever if you're having
trouble with that.

You'll earn about 490 EXP and 330 Macca at the end.

Oh yeah. This is a fun battle. Actually, it's not that hard if you come in with
the right demons and the right level. You should be at level 26+ for this
battle, because you can then fuse Kishin Nalagiri. This is necessary for the
MC, as Nalagiri's Double Hit will allow you to attack Beldr twice per turn.
Since the MC's the one with the devil's fuge and he's the only one that can
thus do damage...you'll want him to attack as much as possible. Give him a
Dragon-type with Evil Wave and you could fight Beldr without taking damage most
of the time, even. But you probably want the Extra Turns, so...unless you're
really dying, don't.

Also, if you have Anti-Mystic, put it on the MC for a few reasons. Beldr's
Vampire Mist, which hits everyone on the field, is Mystic-type, so you won't
take as much damage. (Using demons with St/Nu Mystic would be a good idea, but
Vampire Mist comes around maybe once every four turns, so it's up to you.) The
second, Beldr has +Stone, and the last thing you want is your MC - the only one
who can do damage to him - to get petrified. Grr argh and all that.

So. Make your way carefully towards Beldr, and try to gang up on the demon
teams. Get rid of the ones with Evil Wave asap. Have the MC attack Beldr while
keeping everyone else out of his range - Beldr will move to attack someone else
if you give him the opportunity. Not good.

Oh, one more thing, about the reinforcements. At a late point in the battle (at
least, it should be late, or you might be screwed), Beldr will literally revive
all the demon teams you've killed thus far. Very, very fun.

So, in short. Budget yourself for at least one Vampire Mist healing Beldr by
180 HP or so. Keep your party together and very healed, and out of Beldr's
range. Double Hit Beldr into oblivion. At level 26+ with Nalagiri, provided
that you haven't neglected the rest of your team, this honestly shouldn't be as
hard as it's reputed to be.

You'll earn about 540 EXP and 370 Macca at the end.

No skills to crack, and no demons to fight? This is a joke, right? Or not.
Shifting victory requirements, shifting enemies, shifting allies...fun, fun,
fun. This battle can be complicated if you don't know what's coming.

Whichever victory requirement you choose, you'll have to chase away the
civilians. Midori doesn't fight back, but they shouldn't be able to take her
down. Damage one citizen team, but only slightly (one physical hit from Yuzu or
something should do it), as you still can't kill them. They'll realize you're
tamers and flee north.

Once you do that, Keisuke appears on the north end with a huge chip on his
shoulder. To him, injustice should be punished, and he's the punisher. Or more
specifically, the "objective" judge of the underworld is – don't you love it
when people excuse their actions because they're acting by an "objective"
moral standard?

This new demon companion, Yama, stands by himself on the battlefield. As it
wields multi-target attacks with the ability to attack twice per turn at level
45, you don't want to mess with it. (Unless you're on New Game+.) It has a
movement range of 2, so if you're careful, it shouldn't be able to kill you.

A new escape route opens up south for the civilians, so here's the strategy.
Send someone up to Midori and choose [persuade], and she'll escape through the
underground exit. Quickly send someone really strong towards Keisuke and take
him out, preferably in one blow. Or do it out of his demon buddy's range, as
he'll kill your team in one blow. Once you defeat Keisuke, Yama leaves with
him, which makes this battle much easier. (Defeating Yama will make Keisuke
leave the battle, as well.)

When you or the citizens approach the south exit, several demons appear. Just
a few Noas, but nothing serious. Kill them quickly, though they don't
necessarily prioritize citizens.

The next priority's to catch up with Keisuke, but don't forget what happens at
17:00...

You'll receive about 670 EXP and 410 Macca at the end.

Hey, it's a tamer battle. Only the one auto skill to crack, but it's a nice
one. At the same time, Battle Aura's one of the most annoying things about this
fight, so here goes.

Protect the civilian by rushing in with Devil Speed/Switch/etc and healing him
when necessary. Kill the thugs, especially the teams with Basilisks first. Snag
the nice skill cracks.

Admittedly, Battle Aura could make this fight pretty annoying. If you really
can't get around it, Drain the leader's MP to keep it from kicking in.
Otherwise, keep attacking with your strongest moves and targeting weaknesses,
as that should do over 50 damage (even though Battle Aura's description says
it nullifies damage > 50, it seems to be the opposite).

Once you eliminate most of the tamers, they'll start to flee. Bind if you must,
but they have low movement and should be easy to defeat.

You'll receive about 720 EXP and 470 Macca at the end.

A horde of civilians surround Kaido and Honda, though it looks like Kaido's
snapped. He's going to kill everyone, unless you can stop them. Whatever you
choose at the beginning, you'll have to defeat both tamers to get through the
battle. Kaido has an attack range of three and Honda has a movement of four,
plus they're both way down south.

So. Basically, use your Devil Speed/Switch (very helpful here)/etc strategies
to rush over. You might as well send one team along the skinny right-side path
to get to Honda, while everyone else can gang up on Kaido while keeping all the
civilians alive or whatnot. Chaos Wave will be annoying, but not a huge threat.
Take note that a couple of strong magic users will quickly finish Kaido's team
off.

You'll receive about 780 EXP and 520 Macca at the end.

You stumble upon Mari, who's cornered by Kudlak. Mari tells you to run away and
leave Kudlak alone, and also asks you which way's the best way out. You have
the choice of going down the stairs, or around the park. Whatever you say,
she'll choose to go around the park.

Mari also warns you not to kill Kudlak. This one's up to you. You'll have to
encounter Kudlak one more time, and in that fight, Mari has to deal the
finishing blow. If you don't kill him this time, he'll still be level 35 next
time, and easy enough for you to weaken and Mari to defeat. If you do kill him,
he'll be at level 46 with a new set of (more powerful) moves. If Mari can't
deal the finishing blow in the next battle, she'll die. Leaving him at level 35
makes that fight a bit easier, but a level 46 Kudlak isn't unmanageable (though
Mari will only be able to deal maybe 20 damage to him, making the level a bit
harder). Again, up to you.

Ah, one more thing. Not only can you not defeat Kudlak, but you can't kill the
Loa with him, either. Even if you leave Kudlak alive, he'll still be level 46
if you took out the Loa, I'm pretty sure.

If you have someone with Flight, you can get to the middle of the park quickly.
Set up two others with Devil Speed to go west around the park, and let someone
follow Kudlak's group up the stairs if you want. Having someone with Bind
following Kudlak or someone ready to Switch with Mari on the left side will
make this go a little quicker. Mari won't die - if anything, she'll easily kill
other demon teams whose EXP you want - so don't worry about her even though the
demons will target her. Level 41 and all that.

If you let Mari escape, at the end you'll get two options: "Chase Mari down,"
or "Save your own lives." Whichever one you pick, the battle will end. And no,
your choice doesn't affect anything (I have no idea why it's there).

You'll receive about 850 EXP and 570 Macca at the end.

Hey, a tamer battle...with the police. Fun stuff. You might want to crack Ares
Aid and Alter Pain most especially, as you won't run into a Mahakala or that
auto skill very often.

Anyway, you have three civilians strewn about and no escape route for them to
take, so you'll have to fight quickly, brutally, and efficiently. Shouldn't be
hard, as you should be able to reach most of the cops on your first turn. If
you're having trouble keeping the civilians alive, use Bind or target the party
leaders only. Shouldn't be too difficult.

You'll receive about 900 EXP and 620 Macca at the end.

It kicks off with a big red swirl in the sky, and a ton of events. Not a bad
way to start the day, right? However, you've got Keisuke's and Mari's death
clocks about to time out, and only one way to save them both.

Also, be careful - making the wrong decision today can seal off Atsuro's or
Kaido's routes, respectively.

You've got some new auto skills to crack, but other than that and how you have
to go against a few crazed soldiers, it's nothing special. You'll start in a
clump in the middle, but most of the soldiers are in your range. Gang up on
them in pairs and wipe them out. Go for the ones with Evil Wave (Yms) first, to
make it easier for yourself.

When you eliminate three teams, the rest of the tamers will decide to flee.
Their movement ranges are so small that it shouldn't be a problem.

...Yeah, higher-level Kudlak has less HP. It's just that he'll do more damage,
take less damage, etc etc, so it's up to you which incarnation of him you want
to fight. I think I had an easier time against lv.53 than my friend did versus
lv.46, but both are quite defeatable.

Whether Mari lives or dies, your strategy should only change slightly. The
other demons aren't really a threat, though they can kill Kaido if you don't
take care of them first. The problem lies with Kudlak, who is rather annoying
depending on the stupid RNG/luck of the draw. Weaken him first, Bind him, and
leave it to Mari while you fight everything else. (I had the MC pretty much
whittle his HP down to near nothing so she could deal the final blow.) The
demons will especially go after her and Kaido (if he's there), so try to
weaken/defeat them first and have some healing abilities on hand.

Again, the ridiculous RNG makes all the difference. Mari will more often than
not deal only 20-30 damage (usually 20), and will suffer a great deal of
damage. Sometimes she'll deal closer to 120. Again, it's mostly luck. If you're
fighting the higher-level Kudlak...it's still luck. So, yes, if the RNG has
decided to absolutely hate you, you're going to have to either weaken Kudlak
very, very precisely, or you're going to have to Petrify him. You'll want to
suspend your file when you've succeeded - once, Mari somehow managed to deal no
damage, took 120 damage, and allowed Kudlak to heal over 200 HP, which was fun.

Either way, Mari has to deal the finishing blow. Otherwise, Kudlak will
reincarnate himself yet again, and that time he'll be too strong for Mari, and
she'll die.

If Mari's already dead (because you chose the battle too late), then just kill
Kudlak yourself. Without Kresnik around, he has no more interest in this
country, and will wander off.

Also, the enemies really like Kaido; probably three of them'll swarm him on the
first turn. Urgh. He'll probably survive, but you might want to have someone
Devil Speed over or whatever, just in case.

If Mari dealt the final blow to Kudlak, you'll unlock Kudlak's and Kresnik's
fusions - a Jaki and a Genma - in the Cathedral of Shadows.

You'll receive about 1200 EXP and 800 Macca at the end.

For reasons I haven't quite figured out yet, you might get dialogue with Atsuro
at the beginning where he'll ask, "Maybe we can BS our way through this and
find a way to convince him later?" You can agree or say it's the wrong idea. If
you agree and pick the right options in the next dialogue, Midori will leave
and Keisuke will join, Yama won't kill the cops, and you won't have to fight.
Plus, you'll have to fight against Midori and Kaido in an upcoming battle.
Thus, don't agree with Atsuro and fight the battle to retain all your party
members, earn more EXP, and get skill cracks.

Oh, and yes, BS'ing the battle will seal off Kaido's route since you'll have to
fight him in the future and destroy his COMP.

Basically, protect the civilians, target the tamers, and defeat Yama. When you
defeat the tamers, they'll be left with 150 HP. so make sure they aren't in
Keisuke's range when you defeat them.

Annoyingly, you can't defeat Keisuke, as it's the equivalent of killing him.
You can get rid of the rest of his team and mute or petrify him, though, to
give yourself a breather, as he will keep attacking you otherwise.

Yama's the really fun part. Try to have demons with resistance to fire or phys,
as his attacks will feel quite brutal. Evil Wave will keep you from taking
damage and help weaken him, as well, and you can try to Mute him to stop those
frustrating fire attacks of his. (Or Petrify him if you can, as that'll end it
quickly.) He seems to mostly follow Keisuke around and doesn't usually initiate
fights, as well. As long as you're careful, you should be fine.

After his defeat, Yama, a Deity type, can then be fused in the Cathedral of
Shadows. Keisuke will also rejoin your party.

You'll receive about 1130 EXP and 740 Macca at the end.

If you didn't hand the bag to Kaido and chose to save Mari, or you were late
for whatever reason, you'll see Kaido's Pazuzu kill Keisuke and have to fight
them right then and there. Most of the demons are the same old and won't pose
much of a threat, but swarms of them plus Kaido plus Pazuzu...well.

You might want to kill as many of the Mothman teams as you can and/or get
within their normal range, to prevent them from using Devil Speed and getting
that +15 initiative, as it'll hurt. Combined with the Evil Wave-using Yms, pace
yourself and your teams.

Note that you don't have to defeat Pazuzu, but the experience would be pretty
nice. Evil Wave's the main problem, so just move towards him and Kaido very
carefully while being sure of their attack range. Swarm Pazuzu with several
teams, then go after Kaido. No problem.

After the battle, you'll unlock Pazuzu, a Vile, as a fusion in the Cathedral
of Shadows.

You'll receive about 1130 EXP and 680 Macca at the end.

After you defeat your first demon team or so, one of those red demon-generating
panels appears in the middle. After the first turn, Izuna and Fushimi appear
and attempt to summon a demon. For the rest of the battle, they'll essentially
be fighting that Badb Catha. Once you're done with the other demons, you can go
and help them finish it off.

Otherwise, there really isn't anything special about this battle. Compared to
the Mari and Keisuke frenzy from before, this should be a breeze.

you want to talk to them or not, but I think it's better just to let them run

It's not in the victory requirements, but if you want to beat six demons in one
turn or less, you'll have to have a precise strategy. The turn thing only
applies to the number of turns the MC takes. Thus, if you can put him as far
back in the turn rotation as possible, your other teammates will be able to
kill enough teams for you to win. A Kishin's Double Up is the best way to do
this; other movement racial skills and healing will also push your next turn
back. There are seven demons in all, so if you can eliminate the five teams to
the left and one of the Badb Catha teams, you're all set. Those five will
actively move towards you and attack; the Badb Catha teams are less reliable in
that regard, but if you get close enough, they'll move a little.

If you want to win in one turn: put Double Up on the MC. Have him go towards
the Loa. Someone with Devil Speed can reach the northernmost Orobas, and
someone with Devil Speed or Evil Wave can reach the Legion on the left. If they
have Animal Leg, they can get closer to the Orobas at the top (it'll move if
you're in range). Whoever went after the northernmost Orobas should be able to
get rid of one of the Badb Catha teams before the MC goes again.

Honestly, I'm not sure why there's so much hype about trying to win in one turn
only. Naoya's response is basically the same as if you'd done it in two turns -
he calls it "passing" - and his requirement was three turns. Two is enough and
easily doable on your first playthrough, as it'll still unlock his route. If
you're having a really hard time, just target the team leaders. Also make sure
to kill anything with Bind, or else this'll be a bit annoying.

Otherwise, Naoya just sort of stands there on the side. Don't worry about him -
he won't do anything, and you can't attack him.

You'll receive up to 1520 EXP and 1020 Macca at the end.

the six possible routes you've unlocked.

Also, if you think you can unlock all six routes and get Mari and Black Frost,
you can't waste any time; combined with the required battles, it'll take you
right up to 19:00.

   NOTE: For each route, today there will be one possible event with that
         route's character, where they'll tell you what they think you
         should do and ask you to join them. If you've fulfilled all the
         requirements for their route, the final event will appear and
         you'll have secured the route.

         Note that if you really racked up points against the route (i.e.
         for Amane's route, being angry about the angels all the time,
         answering her emails negatively, answering against the route's
         essence basically), even if you get that last event, you won't
         unlock it.

Hey look, old friends. After you attack the SDF Captain, he'll make two of
those red demon-generating squares appear. They'll probably kick in right when
the battle's winding down, so it's no big deal. Send Atsuro to deal with the
Abaddons and you're all set.

Otherwise, this is pretty straightforward. The Evil Wave users might be
annoying, along with the Captain's Revive auto skill, which will Recarm any of
his fallen companions. Keep out of their range on the first turn so you can
swarm them on your second.

If you're having trouble with the soldiers escaping, you might want to make
sure you have a few teams covering both exits. If you're -really- having a hard
time, you might want to resort to something like Petra Eyes, to immobilize them
and take them out quickly. Or, target the team leaders themselves. Worst comes
to worst, have your teams stand on the escape panels to block them off. But
again, shouldn't be too difficult.

I've gotten several emails on this battle specifically, but...there's not much
else I can say except what I've said above. Remember strengths and weaknesses,
and if you use too many vit-oriented demons, they're going to die (most of the
SDF's demons are mag-oriented, and since magic defense depends on your magic
stat...). So if your demons are at a good level but are still falling over like
logs, that'd be why. Unless you're not paying attention to weaknesses, in which
case, it's that, too.

You'll earn about 1600 EXP and 1090 Macca at the end.

Odd battle. Either way, be sure to choose to help out the demons, as 1) the
tamers give better experience (by far) and a few skill cracks, and 2) you won't
be able to get Black Frost otherwise.

If you chose to go after the demons for whatever reason, you're really not
going to have a hard time. Otherwise, having someone who can Switch with one of
the low-level demons at the start of the battle will help you get to the tamers
sooner and keep the demons safe (one hit, and it's over for them). Just be
mindful of the tamers' Ban auto abilities, and you should be fine. The really
annoying one's the Ban Phys user who has two Abaddon. Either have a few Pierce
users attack, or have one speedy demon/char use a phys attack, to allow multi-
target phys attacks through from other members on that team.

You'll earn about 780 EXP and 10 Macca at the end.

Other:
Mikazuchi Lv: 42, Gin Lv: 42, Berserker Lv: 41


Especially if you're skill cracking, this battle's one huge race - either to
save Gin, or to kill Azuma and the other Believers before Gin does. Gin's
strength is a bit random, to me - once he wiped out Azuma's team in one hit,
and once his team got slaughtered while he only inflicted 30 damage. So it sort
of depends on your luck.

Either way, you'll want the skill cracks. Gin, while he has the Revive auto
skill, doesn't have healing, so get moving. Devil Speed and Phantasma are your
best friends here (though Mothman will be kind of obsolete by this time, you
don't really have a choice unless you're on New Game+ and can fuse a level 62
Behemoth). Switch out Gin if you need to, as well. The enemy has a ton of Ban
auto skills, but nothing you can't handle. If you need Gin's help to get you
through this battle, by all means, keep him healed and let him fight. With
Revive, he can last a really long time.

When the battle's finished, Take-Mikazuchi will be unlocked as a fusion in the
Cathedral of Shadows.

You'll earn about 820 EXP at the end.

Desperate demon tamers picking fights, joy. Why are you always the mediator,
again? Anyway, the office worker types are pretty much weaker than the thugs,
and if you don't get to them first the thugs will probably wipe them out.

You're probably better off sending one person down the skinny east path to deal
with the two tamers that'll be there, and the rest straight south to deal with
the mob. Don't let yourself get ganged up on and you'll be okay - especially
since they'll all be softening each other up, probably before you get there.

You'll get about 1780 EXP and 1180 Macca at the end.

First of all, it doesn't matter what you choose - this battle doesn't affect
your getting Amane's or Naoya's routes. So for the most experience and the
easiest time, you might as well choose to eliminate both the angels and demons.
If you can't handle it and it's too hard, then choosing to eliminate only the
demons will be a lot easier.

Something like Phantasma could be pretty helpful for maneuvering, due to those
annoying half-barricades in the middle. And Power does have Recarm, so be wary
of that.

Every time you kill a demon or angel team, another reinforcement team will
appear. Eventually, Honda and the civilian will attempt to escape. You can
defeat them without killing them, and they'll leave the field. If they escape,
you lose. If you choose to escape with them, you obviously lose as well. This
is pretty much a battle of endurance considering all the enemies you'll be
fighting. It's a good test for the strength of your team, too - with the Final
Day coming up, if you can't handle these demons, it's a good sign that you need
to fuse up your own demons, level up your team, or consider strategy more.

You'll receive up to 1880 EXP and 1260 Macca at the end.

Now this is a fun battle. Yeah, where to begin. First are all the demons, I
suppose. Half of the teams have Chaos Wave and Evil Wave, and most of those are
on the left side. Belial will pretty much come at you from the right side (he
makes a beeline for the MC), so you'll want to split up your party. I suggest
you have Yuzu and the MC go towards the right prepped for the fight against
Belial (more below). Your other teams should deal with all other demons and be
ready to help fight Belial or heal when needed.

I'd advise giving Yuzu (or Midori, etc) an Evil Wave user (Python or Celebre).
Belial can attack 3x per turn, but he can't do anything (and his Life Aid
doesn't kick in) if you use Evil Wave. So have Yuzu behind the MC, weakening
Belial and healing the MC, while you Bufudyne him to pieces. (You might want to
give Yuzu abilities like Drain or passives to keep her MP up.) Be sure to equip
things like fire/phys resistances, Ice Rise/Jump, etc etc. Having a tyrant like
Hecate around will also help slow down Belial's turns and replenish some much-
needed MP. Also, whichever demons you're using on the MC's team? Should null/
drain/reflect fire. The last thing you need is three hits of Maragidyne every
time you engage.

Actually, Belial has Pierce, so if you have a Fire reflect, put that demon in
the left slot of your party - I believe that'll stop Pierce from working on the
other two party members, if they have null/drain fire. (It's what happens to me
when I'm against Piercing demons, anyway.)

Fire of Sodom is a multitarget attack that does heavy fire damage to everyone.
Hopefully you didn't bring anyone weak to fire... At least it doesn't heal
Belial, or you'd be in trouble.

After a while, when you get Belial's HP down fairly low, reinforcements will
show up at the south end in two groups. Hopefully you're fighting Belial as far
north as you can. At this point your other party members can try to hold them
off if possible; or you should focus everyone's energy on defeating Belial, as
your party's probably fairly weakened by now.

You'll earn about 2100 EXP and 1360 Macca at the end.

Just one of those random optional battles that you shouldn't bother fighting,
but. Basically there are a ton of hypnotized civilians who'll keep moving
towards the Sage of Time. Luckily, the other demons won't attack them, but they
will attack you. Rush to the civilians and choose Wake to get them out of their
trances; they'll start escaping. Devil Speed your way towards the Sage of Time
and take him out with strong physical, almighty, or Pierce.

Every few turns or so, another new civilian will show up. Kind of a pain, but
just keep waking them all and hammering away at the Sage of Time and his demon
buddies.

You'll receive about 400 EXP at the end.

Always keep them up-to-date. If you're really struggling, that's probably why.

First, you can walk on the molten lava, but you will take fire damage from
"Fanatic's Lava" at the end of your turn (ow). But, unless you have Evil Wave
or Chaos Wave, you'll have to stand on it to attack Jezebel. So you might want
all the str/null/reflect fire you can have on the teams that'll go after her.
That or use Animal Leg to move back onto not-lava-covered ground.

The Decarabias won't move towards you unless you're in their range. So. Unless
you have a team that nulls fire and can afford to spend a turn or so traversing
the lava, have your teams go around it and take care of the Decarabias. And
note Jezebel's 3x range, and move accordingly. She tends to use Maragidyne,
which is another good reason to have Null/Reflect fire. She'll also whip out
Judgement a few times, so you'll need to keep healing and/or be strong against
Mystic while you're at it.

Damage Jezebel enough and the place will revert back to a flowery garden
(meaning no lava to worry about). You'll also snap Amane out of her stupor.
Jezebel will summon up three doppelgangers of Amane (Mind Amanes). If Amane
gets possessed again, it's the end, so you'll have to defeat them and protect
her. Note that even if you defeat the Mind Amanes, they'll just keep spawning
so that there'll always be at least two on the map. So, you'll have to focus
your energy on Jezebel. And if the Mind Amane teams are slaughtering you (with
Cerberus's Deathbound and Ukano Mitama's Ma-dyne skills, this might be), really
focus all your energy on Jezebel and hold out as best as you can.

Interestingly enough, the Mind Amane teams give far more EXP than Jezebel does.
Ah well. In fact, if you're on NG+ and you're looking for a place to grind
besides/before the Lucifer battle, this isn't bad for it - a Mind Amane team
will give you about 8000+ EXP a pop, and they easily and quickly respawn.
Better than a free battle, at least.

You'll receive about 2300 EXP and 1500 Macca at the end.

   NOTE: After this battle, Amane will join your party. Her Magic is better
         than Yuzu's, but her Speed's sorely lacking (she can't use Ma-dyne
         skills). If you want more of a magic tank than a magic blitzer, I
         suppose you could switch her into your party.

Cerberus Lv: 53, Yaksa Lv: 52, Cerberus Lv: 53


A Kishin-type boss. (Four Devas is basically Kishin's Double Up + Genma's
Phantasm sans the lowered movement cost.) At level 65. Could be painful, so get
ready.

One reinforcement team appears every few turns or so. Cerberus has high Agility
and Yaksa has a devastating Deathbound, so you might want to get rid of them
with a strong ice user if you can. Ice and Almighty will also work wonders
against Bishamon.

The Rangda teams are going to be pure misery for Atsuro and/or your physical-
attack demons. So be careful with your multi-target physical attacks. It might
be better to send a team of them towards Bishamon instead, especially if they
have high Vitality, which you're going to want against him. Pierce would help
against his resistance to phys, too (unless they can wield Ice attacks).

Lucky for you, if Bishamon attacks twice, he'll be pushed pretty far down in
the turn order and you won't have to worry about him initiating attacks for a
while. Send some strong Ice users (Culebre would work really well here, with
Ma/bufudyne and Evil Wave, preventing you from getting hit), and pace yourself.
The moment one of your teams gets severely damaged, get it away from Bishamon
and healed up quickly. With Attack All + Dual Shadow, a fluke could send you
flying.

But yes. Definitely have a few users with Sama/recarm if possible, and major
healing abilities. You can try putting Ban Phys on the team with your weakest
(vitality-wise) demons for a little help.

You'll earn about 2500 EXP and 1800 Macca at the end.

As if the not-so-subtle "I have a feeling we should be careful" and "are you
ready?" messages weren't enough warning, you get to fight two Devas here.

There are a crapload of enemies, but most of them have elemental weaknesses
that you can easily take advantage of. In particular, someone with strong elec-
type attacks should go towards Koumoku, and someone with force towards Zouchou.
Have all the Ma-dynes equipped to make it easier on yourself, as all the teams
have two of the same demon (and thus twice the susceptibility), with the
exception of the Devas' teams. You might want to send your physical attackers
towards the Yaksa and not the Rangda. Actually, forget the "might" part.

Otherwise, both Devas are noticeably weaker than Bishamon, and don't have as
many resistances or annoying passives. Still, both of them have Evil Wave, so
couple that with Double Up and you might get hit pretty hard if you're not
prepared. Be patient and don't let the enemies get the jump on you, and kill
the Culebres when you get a chance. Just move cautiously and keep yourself
healed, and this should go pretty smoothly.

You'll earn about 2700 EXP and 2100 Macca at the end.

So. Charming bug thing aside. Doesn't look like a particularly tough battle
with anything strange to throw at you, and you get a nice choice of skills to
crack, right?

Yeah, well. Have a magic user with a lot of MP crack Prayer during this battle
and set it (if you don't have it already). Have a Megami or two. And give
someone like Atsuro Amrita. You'll see why later. Also, a few Sama/recarms
won't hurt, and are probably necessary.

Belzaboul has an immense attack range, but it takes a while for his turn to
come up. Take advantage of that time as follows.

Once you kill two teams OR attack Belzaboul, the battle changes. Make sure that
whatever you chose to crack (that isn't on Belzaboul), you crack within those
two teams you kill. The reason why is afterwards, all the remaining teams
change into Maggots. Yes, very charming. They're far more dangerous than run-
of-the-mill demons, as they have the Spawn almighty attack. This'll deal damage
and have a fairly good chance of spawning eggs on the target, which is a status
ailment indicated by a little bug.

This is why you need all those teams with the ability to not just heal, but
cure. A few very short turns after, the eggs'll hatch and deal damage, usually
killing their host, and it'll spawn a new team of maggots on the map. So fun.
Belzaboul also has Spawn now, so you can't really avoid it. Just cure whoever
gets afflicted as quickly as possible, and revive who you need to, as you're
probably not going to be able to avoid several party members dying.

So, Belzaboul. Again, don't attack it until after the Maggots appear to
maximize your skill cracks. Spam almighty on it, use demons strong against
mystic, etc. If you have anyone that reflects force, that'd help minorly. If
the team you use to attack him has Amrita/Prayer/Affection, that'll help, as
you have a fairly good chance of getting afflicted. Just cure your way through
this battle and hold your ground (and towards the end, you should be able to
keep your party members all right next to Belzaboul so he can't strike you
without retaliation). Easily a very, very annoying battle if you let the
Maggots get out of hand, so you'll want that cure.

You'll get about 2950 EXP and 2400 Macca at the end.

I'd advise you to crack Victory Cry off Belberith and three of the four
available auto skills off the Believers (especially Rage Soul and Grace).
Unless you still don't have Samarecarm and Mediarahan, in which case.

Phantasm or Flight would be pretty helpful for this battle, as you could then
pass through the obstacles/looping area where you deploy. Then, with the
bridges sealed off, you'll have to send two teams to the control area (the
consoles must be activated simultaneously), and two teams to either end to wait
for the bridges to go up. If you have Phantasm/Flight, put it on the teams
heading towards the consoles, as they'll be able to leap up onto the altar and
fight Belberith without having to double all the way back around. Devil Speed's
the next best choice.

You also want to put Ma/zandyne and Almighty abilities on your main Belberith
attackers. Physical fighters with Pierce are also good.

Get within three spaces of the Believers and they will move to attack you.
Otherwise, they won't move. The two Believers on the sides will make their
COMPs go berserk upon defeat, creating those red demon-generating spaces where
they were standing. When you defeat the two Believers standing on the switch
activation spots, a reinforcement each will appear on the red spaces by
Belberith. You'll probably want to pick up those COMPs to stop the
reinforcements, especially if you're struggling here.

Against the Believer with Rage Soul, you'll want a team that has Devil Speed
(for the +15 initiative), insane agility, or a ton of phys resist fighters,
otherwise that team's going to hit you real hard. And don't forget the teams
that have Barrier and Wall and accidentally use really powerful phys or magic
that'll just reflect on you. You might want to send your physical fighter
toward the Barrier user and vice versa; note that Barrier does not block
Almighty, at least.

Belberith is way down below in the turn order, as you'll probably get to move
two or three times before his first attack. Unfortunately, he can target anyone
he likes, so you can't really do anything about that. In my case he always went
after Yuzu, which I suspect is because of her Magic Yang ability. (Yeah, who
knows.) If one of your teams is pretty weakened, though, he'll definitely
target them, so be warned.

Belberith's weak to force and has Maziodyne and Mabufudyne. So, no demons that
are weak to elec or ice. If you have any that can reflect, that's even better.
Victory Cry will heal a good chunk of HP and MP, so you want to be dealing a
good 500 damage or so every time you engage him at the least. Though, if you
have a souped-up magic-oriented MC and/or Yuzu, either of them with Holy Dance
should easily hit for 500-ish damage on their own. A Megami with Holy Dance
will do just as much damage, if not more (and you really should have Norn or
Amaterasu by now, anyway).

By the way, if you need to fuse Holy Dance onto anyone, just buy a few Ym with
Watchful. Let them get experience (especially if they haven't learned Holy
Dance yet), fuse them into a Mitama that'll get some experience, and fuse it to
whatever demon. You'll get Holy Dance, +3 Strength, and maybe a boost to other
stats as well. Not a bad deal when you make this much Macca at this point.

You'll earn about 3200 EXP and 2800 Macca at the end.


   NOTE: The free battle at the top of the Hills building can net you an
         awesome skill crack. Shiva, a Deity, appears very, very rarely - I'd
         say about 5% of the time or so - but he has Megidolaon and Victory
         Cry. This is definitely where you want to get Megidolaon from, so.
         Keep fighting/retreating from/restarting the free battle until you
         see it.

[S] Phys  [S] Fire  [S] Ice
[S] Elec  [S] Force [S] Mystic
Megidolaon, Diarahan, Deathbound | Anti-All, Beast Eye, Mana Aid | Tyranny


You're still going to want Flight and Phantasm, this time to get back over the
altar to the other side, where Naoya is. And you'll want to crack Anti-All, as
this is pretty much your only chance to get it.

A turn in, flashy gigolo guy will appear on the right side, reveal himself as
Loki, and fight you. His Megidolaon will definitely hurt, so approach him
carefully. Draining away his MP could help, as it's very doable with a magic-
oriented MC. Still, Tyranny + Mana Aid will thwart you a bit. Atsuro + Pierce
and a host of phys boosters/skills should help. And you can also just Evil/
Chaos Wave him if need be.

Naoya...also has Megidolaon. But he doesn't have any mana-replenishing moves,
so Drain might be a better idea on him. Pretty much only Almighty attacks are
going to do good damage to him (plus they'll bypass his Shield All), so.

In short, against Loki and Naoya, you're just going to want a lot of Almighty
and a lot of endurance. And hope they don't use Me/diarahan too much. If their
magic abilities are really causing you that much trouble, you might have to
resort to a Pierce + Makajamaon/Mute Eyes combination.

After this battle, you'll be able to fuse Loki, a Tyrant-type, in the Cathedral
of Shadows.

You'll get about 3300 EXP and 2900 Macca at the end.

So, final battle. Be prepared, obviously. No wimpy demons (yours should all be
pretty high-tier, maybe with average base levels in the mid-50s - if you're on
New Game+, though, you should easily have some base level 60s), because you do
not have the MP to be wasting on Samarecarm every other turn in this battle. 
Have a few Tyrant- (if you've unlocked Loki, here's a great battle for him) and
Divine-type demons (Kazfiel, Remiel) to keep your MP up. You'll be using things
like Holy Dance a ton in this battle, and you don't want to run out. Having a
Deity (Shiva, Asura) with Awakening to up the strength of your Almighty attacks
can help, too. And obviously you want healing and cure.

Oh, and put Ma/ziodyne on your main magic-using attackers. Along with the usual
Almighty, etc. Babel's final form is weak to elec. You might also want to put
Ma/zandyne on a few people, as well.

About every three turns or so two reinforcements will appear in the northwest
and northeast red circles. Unfortunately, they're not those demon-spawning
squares caused by COMPs that you can pick up, so get used to them.

The first Babel form shouldn't be too hard. Rush it, spam almighty and/or
characters with pierce, and it should go down quickly.

Once that's done, Babel shows its true form. Well, not quite - it summons Beldr
and Belial, first of all. Oh yeah. And yep, only the MC can damage Belial. All
of your teams will be clustered around the organ in the center.

Don't worry about having a Kishin on the MC – Beldr has low HP, and if you're
at a good level, he won't be a problem at all. And Belial's still weak to ice.
Defeat them, and a ramp will appear leading to Babel – with Jezebel guarding
it. This'll lead to a series of fights – first her, then Beelzebub, then
Belberith. Don't worry about Beelzebub's spawn – once you defeat it, the
ailment will disappear from anyone who had it. If you defeat it fast enough,
that is.

All the Bels have the same resistances and weaknesses that they did the first
time you fought them. So implement the same strategies you used before, etc.

After all that, Babel will split open and you'll be able to fight it. It's now
got an infinite attack range and a new repertoire that includes Megidolaon. 
Basically you'll want to be kind of careful at this point. If you have a slow
healer in your lineup, you can have them heal on the assumption that Babel'll
deal pretty bad damage with Megidolaon or Attack All, especially if Babel has
an Extra Turn.

Babel does have a weakness to elec, and Atsuro + pierce will blow through his
Str to phys. Of course, you should still be spamming almighty as well.
Otherwise, this is a huge battle of endurance. Suspend here and there, because
dealing with a Dual Shadow'd Megidolaon is not particularly fun.


And...the end. You're now the overlord - er, Messiah. And stuff. But, you now
get to fuse Metatron, a Divine-type, in the Cathedral of Shadows.

Definitely crack Full Might off Naoya - it's a great fit for Atsuro. This is
also the only route where you can find it.

There are four of the red demon-generating spaces, and they'll all cough up
reinforcements every three turns or so. You can pick up the COMPs by standing
on those spaces, but you probably won't need to. I basically had one person
kill nearly all the reinforcements while I had the other three teams chase
Naoya around.

Ah yes. On Naoya's first turn (and he has a whopping speed of 75, so there's
nothing to be done), he'll run away from you with Devil Speed and Phantasma.
Consider this a warning of how the rest of the battle will go.

The main problem lies in catching up to him. You can have a few of your guys
chase him and someone with Switch ready to move in just in time to attack
before he runs again, which worked the best for me. Phantasm will help lower
your move costs and make it easier to get around. You might be able to catch up
with Devil Speed, as well. Without at least one of those, you might be a little
sunk.

To defeat Naoya, you'll want to use teams with phys null/reflect/drain. Full
Might (ensures critical) plus two Deathbound users equals pain, pain, pain.
Almighty damage is your best way to damage him, though his Behemoth's weak to
fire. Getting rid of it will keep Naoya from running away, as well. When you
weaken Naoya enough he won't run any more, either.

You'll receive about 2300 EXP and 1500 Macca at the end.

A Kishin-type boss. (Four Devas is basically Kishin's Double Up + Genma's
Phantasm sans the lowered movement cost.) At level 65. Could be painful, so get
ready.

One reinforcement team appears every few turns or so. Cerberus has high Agility
and Yaksa has a devastating Deathbound, so you might want to get rid of them
with a strong ice user if you can. Ice and Almighty will also work wonders
against Bishamon.

The Rangda teams are going to be pure misery for your physical fighter (Atsuro,
Izuna, or both) and/or physical-attack demons. So be careful with your multi-
target physical attacks. It might be better to send a team of them towards
Bishamon instead, especially if they have high Vitality, which you're going to
want against him. Pierce would help against his resistance to phys, too (unless
they can wield Ice attacks).

Lucky for you, if Bishamon attacks twice, he'll be pushed pretty far down in
the turn order and you won't have to worry about him initiating attacks for a
while. Send some strong Ice users (Culebre would work really well here, with
Ma/bufudyne and Evil Wave, preventing you from getting hit), and pace yourself.
The moment one of your teams gets severely damaged, get it away from Bishamon
and healed up quickly. With Attack All + Dual Shadow, a fluke could send you
flying.

But yes. Definitely have a few users with Sama/recarm if possible, and major
healing abilities. You can try putting Ban Phys on the team with your weakest
(vitality-wise) demons for a little help.

(By the way, if you've decided to use Izuna...well, you should definitely be
using Atsuro no matter what - he's required in the final battle. Just saying.)

You'll earn about 2500 EXP and 1800 Macca at the end.

As if the not-so-subtle "I have a feeling we should be careful" and "are you
ready?" messages weren't enough warning, you get to fight two Devas here.

There are a crapload of enemies, but most of them have elemental weaknesses
that you can easily take advantage of. In particular, someone with strong elec-
type attacks should go towards Koumoku, and someone with force towards Zouchou.
Have all the Ma-dynes equipped to make it easier on yourself, as all the teams
have two of the same demon (and thus twice the susceptibility), with the
exception of the Devas' teams. You might want to send your physical attacker/s
towards the Yaksa and not the Rangda. Actually, forget the "might" part.

Otherwise, both Devas are noticeably weaker than Bishamon, and don't have as
many resistances or annoying passives. Still, both of them have Evil Wave, so
couple that with Double Up and you might get hit pretty hard if you're not
prepared. Be patient and don't let the enemies get the jump on you, and kill
the Culebres when you get a chance. Just move cautiously and keep yourself
healed, and this should go pretty smoothly.

You'll earn about 2700 EXP and 2100 Macca at the end.

So. Charming bug thing aside. Doesn't look like a particularly tough battle
with anything strange to throw at you, and you get a nice choice of skills to
crack, right?

Yeah, well. Have a magic user with a lot of MP crack Prayer during this battle
and set it (if you don't have it already). Have a Megami or two. And give
someone like Atsuro/Izuna Amrita. You'll see why later. Also, a few
Sama/recarms won't hurt, and are probably necessary.

Belzaboul has an immense attack range, but it takes a while for his turn to
come up. Take advantage of that time as follows.

Once you kill two teams OR attack Belzaboul, the battle changes. Make sure that
whatever you chose to crack (that isn't on Belzaboul), you crack within those
two teams you kill. The reason why is afterwards, all the remaining teams
change into Maggots. Yes, very charming. They're far more dangerous than run-
of-the-mill demons, as they have the Spawn almighty attack. This'll deal damage
and have a fairly good chance of spawning eggs on the target, which is a status
ailment indicated by a little bug.

This is why you need all those teams with the ability to not just heal, but
cure. A few very short turns after, the eggs'll hatch and deal damage, usually
killing their host, and it'll spawn a new team of maggots on the map. So fun.
Belzaboul also has Spawn now, so you can't really avoid it. Just cure whoever
gets afflicted as quickly as possible, and revive who you need to, as you're
probably not going to be able to avoid several party members dying.

So, Belzaboul. Again, don't attack it until after the Maggots appear to
maximize your skill cracks. Spam almighty on it, use demons strong against
mystic, etc. If you have anyone that reflects force, that'd help minorly. If
the team you use to attack him has Amrita/Prayer/Affection, that'll help, as
you have a fairly good chance of getting afflicted. Just cure your way through
this battle and hold your ground (and towards the end, you should be able to
keep your party members all right next to Belzaboul so he can't strike you
without retaliation). Easily a very, very annoying battle if you let the
Maggots get out of hand, so you'll want that cure.

You'll get about 2950 EXP and 2400 Macca at the end.

I'd advise you to crack Victory Cry off Belberith and three of the four
available auto skills off the Believers (especially Rage Soul and Grace).
Unless you still don't have Samarecarm and Mediarahan, in which case.

Phantasm or Flight would be pretty helpful for this battle, as you could then
pass through the obstacles/looping area where you deploy. Then, with the
bridges sealed off, you'll have to send two teams to the control area (the
consoles must be activated simultaneously), and two teams to either end to wait
for the bridges to go up. If you have Phantasm/Flight, put it on the teams
heading towards the consoles, as they'll be able to leap up onto the altar and
fight Belberith without having to double all the way back around. Devil Speed's
the next best choice.

You also want to put Ma/zandyne and Almighty abilities on your main Belberith
attackers. Physical fighters with Pierce are also good.

Get within three spaces of the Believers and they will move to attack you.
Otherwise, they won't move. The two Believers on the sides will make their
COMPs go berserk upon defeat, creating those red demon-generating spaces where
they were standing. When you defeat the two Believers standing on the switch
activation spots, a reinforcement each will appear on the red spaces by
Belberith. You'll probably want to pick up those COMPs to stop the
reinforcements, especially if you're struggling here.

Against the Believer with Rage Soul, you'll want a team that has Devil Speed
(for the +15 initiative), insane agility, or a ton of phys resist fighters,
otherwise that team's going to hit you real hard. And don't forget the teams
that have Barrier and Wall and accidentally use really powerful phys or magic
that'll just reflect on you. You might want to send your physical fighter
toward the Barrier user and vice versa; note that Barrier does not block
Almighty, at least.

Belberith is way down below in the turn order, as you'll probably get to move
two or three times before his first attack. Unfortunately, he can target anyone
he likes, so you can't really do anything about that. In my case he always went
after Yuzu, which I suspect is because of her Magic Yang ability. (Yeah, who
knows.) If one of your teams is pretty weakened, though, he'll definitely
target them, so be warned.

Belberith's weak to force and has Maziodyne and Mabufudyne. So, no demons that
are weak to elec or ice. If you have any that can reflect, that's even better.
Victory Cry will heal a good chunk of HP and MP, so you want to be dealing a
good 500 damage or so every time you engage him at the least. Though, if you
have a souped-up magic-oriented MC and/or Yuzu, either of them with Holy Dance
should easily hit for 500-ish damage on their own. A Megami with Holy Dance
will do just as much damage, if not more (and you really should have Norn or
Amaterasu by now, anyway).

By the way, if you need to fuse Holy Dance onto anyone, just buy a few Ym with
Watchful. Let them get experience (especially if they haven't learned Holy
Dance yet), fuse them into a Mitama that'll get some experience, and fuse it to
whatever demon. You'll get Holy Dance, +3 Strength, and maybe a boost to other
stats as well. Not a bad deal when you make this much Macca at this point.

You'll earn about 3200 EXP and 2800 Macca at the end.


   NOTE: The free battle at the top of the Hills building can net you an
         awesome skill crack. Shiva, a Deity, appears very, very rarely - I'd
         say about 5% of the time or so - but he has Megidolaon and Victory
         Cry. This is definitely where you want to get Megidolaon from, so.
         Keep fighting/retreating from/restarting the free battle until you
         see it.

So, final battle. Be prepared, obviously. No wimpy demons (yours should all be
pretty high-tier, maybe with average base levels in the mid-50s - if you're on
New Game+, though, you should easily have some base level 60s), because you do
not have the MP to be wasting on Samarecarm every other turn in this battle. 
Have a few Tyrant- (if you've unlocked Loki, here's a great battle for him) and
Divine-type demons (Kazfiel, Remiel) to keep your MP up. You'll be using things
like Holy Dance a ton in this battle, and you don't want to run out. Having a
Deity (Shiva, Asura) with Awakening to up the strength of your Almighty attacks
can help, too.

About every three turns or so two reinforcements will appear in the northwest
and northeast red circles. Unfortunately, they're not those demon-spawning
squares caused by COMPs that you can pick up, so get used to them.

Your first goal's to let Naoya get to the center stage so he can hack the
server. He's not weak by any means, so protecting him shouldn't be hard. When
Naoya gets there, he'll point Atsuro to the right platform. Might want to
prepare your party beforehand by making sure everyone's fairly healed before
letting Atsuro access the console. Once Atsuro gets there, a big...gray
floating head will appear at the tower. The security program, apparently, aka
Babel.

But as Naoya says, your hack's dead in the water if you don't take care of it.
And if Babel attacks three times before you take it down, it'll shut down
Atsuro's console and you'll have to move him all the way to the other one. So,
try not to let that happen if you can, as the reinforcements don't stop coming
and Atsuro's more or less out of commission when he's at the console. The first
form shouldn't be too hard. Spam almighty and/or characters with pierce, and it
should go down quickly.

Once that's done, Babel shows its true form. Very appealing – especially the
infinite attack range (luckily it doesn't go after Naoya) and a new move
repertoire that includes Megidolaon. You'll get Atsuro again for this part of
the battle, so it should help a little. Basically you'll want to be kind of
careful at this point. If you have a slow healer in your lineup, you can have
them heal on the assumption that Babel'll deal pretty bad damage with
Megidolaon or Attack All, especially if Babel has an Extra Turn.

Note that Babel does have a weakness, but it might be hard to take advantage of
it. Every time you hack away 1/3 of Babel's HP, it'll change forms – which
means a different weakness (elec, force, phys) and Ma-dyne spells. So hit its
weakness if you can (in particular, Atsuro can probably get there in time for
the third form to take advantage of that phys weakness), though you should
still be spamming almighty as well. Otherwise, this is a huge battle of
endurance. Suspend here and there, because dealing with a Dual Shadow'd
Megidolaon is not particularly fun.

This fight against Babel definitely isn't as bad as other Babel fights in other
routes, though, so be thankful. :]


At the end of the battle, you can choose between three options to return all
the demons. As far as I can tell, there's really no difference among them.
And...yep, that's all for Atsuro's route. You don't unlock any fusions in this
one. Not a bad route at all, though.

=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=

After you make your choice, you'll gain Gin as a party member. If you fulfilled
the requirements, you'll also get Mari and Black Frost. This is the only route
where you can play as Gin, so if you're like me and you tend to play as
characters whom you like, not just the strongest/etc ones, take advantage of
it. Otherwise, a crazy number of characters join you on this route (Amane,
Izuna...basically everyone except Naoya and Kaido), so you'll have a lot of
options.

However, doesn't mean you should use everyone. If you're not on your first
playthrough you can do what you will, but I highly advise that you use Atsuro
and don't use Black Frost, because of things that will happen in the final
Babel fight. And if you're on your first playthrough...it'll be really hard
otherwise.

Remember, even if your team leaders are at comparable levels to the enemies
you're fighting, you have to remember your demons as well. Really, really.
Always keep them up-to-date. If you're really struggling, that's probably why.

First, you can walk on the molten lava, but you will take fire damage from
"Fanatic's Lava" at the end of your turn (ow). But, unless you have Evil Wave
or Chaos Wave, you'll have to stand on it to attack Jezebel. So you might want
all the str/null/reflect fire you can have on the teams that'll go after her.
That or use Animal Leg to move back onto not-lava-covered ground.

The Decarabias won't move towards you unless you're in their range. So. Unless
you have a team that nulls fire and can afford to spend a turn or so traversing
the lava, have your teams go around it and take care of the Decarabias. And
note Jezebel's 3x range, and move accordingly. She tends to use Maragidyne,
which is another good reason to have Null/Reflect fire. She'll also whip out
Judgement a few times, so you'll need to keep healing and/or be strong against
Mystic while you're at it.

Damage Jezebel enough and the place will revert back to a flowery garden
(meaning no lava to worry about). You'll also snap Amane out of her stupor.
Jezebel will summon up three doppelgangers of Amane (Mind Amanes). If Amane
gets possessed again, it's the end, so you'll have to defeat them and protect
her. Note that even if you defeat the Mind Amanes, they'll just keep spawning
so that there'll always be at least two on the map. So, you'll have to focus
your energy on Jezebel. And if the Mind Amane teams are slaughtering you (with
Cerberus's Deathbound and Ukano Mitama's Ma-dyne skills, this might be), really
focus all your energy on Jezebel and hold out as best as you can.

Interestingly enough, the Mind Amane teams give far more EXP than Jezebel does.
Ah well. In fact, if you're on NG+ and you're looking for a place to grind
besides/before the Lucifer battle, this isn't bad for it - a Mind Amane team
will give you about 8000+ EXP a pop, and they easily and quickly respawn.
Better than a free battle, at least.

You'll receive about 2300 EXP and 1500 Macca at the end.

   NOTE: After this battle, Amane will join your party. Her Magic is better
         than Yuzu's, but her Speed's sorely lacking (she can't use Ma-dyne
         skills). If you want more of a magic tank than a magic blitzer, I
         suppose you could switch her into your party.

A Kishin-type boss. (Four Devas is basically Kishin's Double Up + Genma's
Phantasm sans the lowered movement cost.) At level 65. Could be painful, so get
ready.

One reinforcement team appears every few turns or so. Cerberus has high Agility
and Yaksa has a devastating Deathbound, so you might want to get rid of them
with a strong ice user if you can. Ice and Almighty will also work wonders
against Bishamon.

The Rangda teams are going to be pure misery for Atsuro and/or your physical-
attack demons. So be careful with your multi-target physical attacks. It might
be better to send a team of them towards Bishamon instead, especially if they
have high Vitality, which you're going to want against him. Pierce would help
against his resistance to phys, too (unless they can wield Ice attacks).

Lucky for you, if Bishamon attacks twice, he'll be pushed pretty far down in
the turn order and you won't have to worry about him initiating attacks for a
while. Send some strong Ice users (Culebre would work really well here, with
Ma/bufudyne and Evil Wave, preventing you from getting hit), and pace yourself.
The moment one of your teams gets severely damaged, get it away from Bishamon
and healed up quickly. With Attack All + Dual Shadow, a fluke could send you
flying.

But yes. Definitely have a few users with Sama/recarm if possible, and major
healing abilities. You can try putting Ban Phys on the team with your weakest
(vitality-wise) demons for a little help.

You'll earn about 2500 EXP and 1800 Macca at the end.

As if the not-so-subtle "I have a feeling we should be careful" and "are you
ready?" messages weren't enough warning, you get to fight two Devas here.

There are a crapload of enemies, but most of them have elemental weaknesses
that you can easily take advantage of. In particular, someone with strong elec-
type attacks should go towards Koumoku, and someone with force towards Zouchou.
Have all the Ma-dynes equipped to make it easier on yourself, as all the teams
have two of the same demon (and thus twice the susceptibility), with the
exception of the Devas' teams. You might want to send your physical attackers
towards the Yaksa and not the Rangda. Actually, forget the "might" part.

Otherwise, both Devas are noticeably weaker than Bishamon, and don't have as
many resistances or annoying passives. Still, both of them have Evil Wave, so
couple that with Double Up and you might get hit pretty hard if you're not
prepared. Be patient and don't let the enemies get the jump on you, and kill
the Culebres when you get a chance. Just move cautiously and keep yourself
healed, and this should go pretty smoothly.

You'll earn about 2700 EXP and 2100 Macca at the end.

So. Charming bug thing aside. Doesn't look like a particularly tough battle
with anything strange to throw at you, and you get a nice choice of skills to
crack, right?

Yeah, well. Have a magic user with a lot of MP crack Prayer during this battle
and set it (if you don't have it already). Have a Megami or two. And give
someone like Atsuro Amrita. You'll see why later. Also, a few Sama/recarms
won't hurt, and are probably necessary.

Belzaboul has an immense attack range, but it takes a while for his turn to
come up. Take advantage of that time as follows.

Once you kill two teams OR attack Belzaboul, the battle changes. Make sure that
whatever you chose to crack (that isn't on Belzaboul), you crack within those
two teams you kill. The reason why is afterwards, all the remaining teams
change into Maggots. Yes, very charming. They're far more dangerous than run-
of-the-mill demons, as they have the Spawn almighty attack. This'll deal damage
and have a fairly good chance of spawning eggs on the target, which is a status
ailment indicated by a little bug.

This is why you need all those teams with the ability to not just heal, but
cure. A few very short turns after, the eggs'll hatch and deal damage, usually
killing their host, and it'll spawn a new team of maggots on the map. So fun.
Belzaboul also has Spawn now, so you can't really avoid it. Just cure whoever
gets afflicted as quickly as possible, and revive who you need to, as you're
probably not going to be able to avoid several party members dying.

So, Belzaboul. Again, don't attack it until after the Maggots appear to
maximize your skill cracks. Spam almighty on it, use demons strong against
mystic, etc. If you have anyone that reflects force, that'd help minorly. If
the team you use to attack him has Amrita/Prayer/Affection, that'll help, as
you have a fairly good chance of getting afflicted. Just cure your way through
this battle and hold your ground (and towards the end, you should be able to
keep your party members all right next to Belzaboul so he can't strike you
without retaliation). Easily a very, very annoying battle if you let the
Maggots get out of hand, so you'll want that cure.

You'll get about 2950 EXP and 2400 Macca at the end.

I'd advise you to crack Victory Cry off Belberith and three of the four
available auto skills off the Believers (especially Rage Soul and Grace).
Unless you still don't have Samarecarm and Mediarahan, in which case.

Phantasm or Flight would be pretty helpful for this battle, as you could then
pass through the obstacles/looping area where you deploy. Then, with the
bridges sealed off, you'll have to send two teams to the control area (the
consoles must be activated simultaneously), and two teams to either end to wait
for the bridges to go up. If you have Phantasm/Flight, put it on the teams
heading towards the consoles, as they'll be able to leap up onto the altar and
fight Belberith without having to double all the way back around. Devil Speed's
the next best choice.

You also want to put Ma/zandyne and Almighty abilities on your main Belberith
attackers. Physical fighters with Pierce are also good.

Get within three spaces of the Believers and they will move to attack you.
Otherwise, they won't move. The two Believers on the sides will make their
COMPs go berserk upon defeat, creating those red demon-generating spaces where
they were standing. When you defeat the two Believers standing on the switch
activation spots, a reinforcement each will appear on the red spaces by
Belberith. You'll probably want to pick up those COMPs to stop the
reinforcements, especially if you're struggling here.

Against the Believer with Rage Soul, you'll want a team that has Devil Speed
(for the +15 initiative), insane agility, or a ton of phys resist fighters,
otherwise that team's going to hit you real hard. And don't forget the teams
that have Barrier and Wall and accidentally use really powerful phys or magic
that'll just reflect on you. You might want to send your physical fighter
toward the Barrier user and vice versa; note that Barrier does not block
Almighty, at least.

Belberith is way down below in the turn order, as you'll probably get to move
two or three times before his first attack. Unfortunately, he can target anyone
he likes, so you can't really do anything about that. In my case he always went
after Yuzu, which I suspect is because of her Magic Yang ability. (Yeah, who
knows.) If one of your teams is pretty weakened, though, he'll definitely
target them, so be warned.

Belberith's weak to force and has Maziodyne and Mabufudyne. So, no demons that
are weak to elec or ice. If you have any that can reflect, that's even better.
Victory Cry will heal a good chunk of HP and MP, so you want to be dealing a
good 500 damage or so every time you engage him at the least. Though, if you
have a souped-up magic-oriented MC and/or Yuzu, either of them with Holy Dance
should easily hit for 500-ish damage on their own. A Megami with Holy Dance
will do just as much damage, if not more (and you really should have Norn or
Amaterasu by now, anyway).

By the way, if you need to fuse Holy Dance onto anyone, just buy a few Ym with
Watchful. Let them get experience (especially if they haven't learned Holy
Dance yet), fuse them into a Mitama that'll get some experience, and fuse it to
whatever demon. You'll get Holy Dance, +3 Strength, and maybe a boost to other
stats as well. Not a bad deal when you make this much Macca at this point.

You'll earn about 3200 EXP and 2800 Macca at the end.


   NOTE: The free battle at the top of the Hills building can net you an
         awesome skill crack. Shiva, a Deity, appears very, very rarely - I'd
         say about 5% of the time or so - but he has Megidolaon and Victory
         Cry. This is definitely where you want to get Megidolaon from, so.
         Keep fighting/retreating from/restarting the free battle until you
         see it.

This battle's drastically different from the other Babel fights. It's closest
to the one on Atsuro's route, though. A few important things: Atsuro's required
(hopefully you've been using him, as he will be -very- useful here), and during
the second phase of the battle, you -do not get to use any demons-. This was
why I advised against using Black Frost - he disappears before the second phase
begins. More on it later, though.

If you're on NG+, you should have it way easier. If you're not...this battle,
unless you grinded a ton, requires careful planning.

So, final battle. Be prepared, obviously. No wimpy demons (yours should all be
pretty high-tier, maybe with average base levels in the mid-50s - if you're on
New Game+, though, you should easily have some base level 60s), because you do
not have the MP to be wasting on Samarecarm every other turn in this battle. 
Have a few Tyrant- (if you've unlocked Loki, here's a great battle for him) and
Divine-type demons (Kazfiel, Remiel) to keep your MP up. You'll be using things
like Holy Dance a ton in this battle, and you don't want to run out. Having a
Deity (Shiva, Asura) with Awakening to up the strength of your Almighty attacks
can help, too. And obviously you want healing and cure.

You want to put single-target -Dynes on your team leaders for the second phase,
as Babel's weaknesses will shift (elec, force, and then phys). MP conservation
will be important, so make sure you're using Drain, Mana Aid, Victory Cry, and
Magic Yang. Someone'll get two of these, so Mana Aid/Magic Yang might be the
ones you'd want to combo. Give this person or your Drain user Holy Dance.
Atsuro should definitely be decked out with Deathbound, Phys Jump, and Pierce -
he'll be crucial to taking down the final form. Also, because he'll be
Deathbounding it up, make sure he either has Drain Hit/Life Lift. Or, have
Mediarahan/Prayer/Diarahan. If you have a spot and you think you'll have
problems with mana, definitely put Diarahan on someone.

So, first phase of the battle, first. Keep a unit to Haru's right - one Ganesha
team will otherwise land on it before you can stop it, and if it touches Haru,
she's dead. I left Atsuro there to deal with it. Haru'll basically be following
Atsuro around the entire first phase, so make sure you're always moving four
steps in front of her to take advantage of her movement range of 3. Depending
on how strong your teams are, you'll need 1-2 other teams on that side,
surrounding Haru (to keep Ganesha/Behemoths from getting the jump on her) and
defeating everything quickly. Be careful with Atsuro, especially if you don't
have Phys Repel on him - might want to slap Fire Dance or something on him, so
he can fight the Murmur teams.

About every three turns or so two reinforcements will appear in the northwest
and northeast red circles. Unfortunately, they're not those demon-spawning
squares caused by COMPs that you can pick up, so get used to them. Be glad you
don't have to refight the whole Bel gauntlet this time, really.

Once Atsuro gets to the console, Haru'll have to reach the leftmost of the
three spaces. Do that and upload the song successfully, and Babel will appear.
Haru will leave once her role's done, so you won't have to keep protecting her
any more. You'll also be able to use Atsuro again whenever his turn comes
around.

The first Babel form shouldn't be too hard. Rush it, spam almighty and/or
characters with pierce, and it should go down quickly. However, you might want
to make sure your team leaders are healed up with as much MP as possible,
especially towards the end of the battle, in preparation for the second phase.
So, let your demons do most of the fighting.

Once that's done, Babel will split open and you'll be able to fight it. Before
then, you'll lose all your demons and Black Frost, if you have him. Time to go
it alone. Babel's now got an infinite attack range and a new repertoire that,
while lacking in passives, includes Megidolaon. Did I mention your teams are
all solo?

Babel does have a weakness to elec for...about the first turn or so (otherwise
it'll switch to force, and then phys), and Atsuro + pierce will blow through
his HP. Of course, you should still be spamming almighty as well. Otherwise,
this is a huge battle of endurance. Suspend here and there, because dealing
with Megidolaon is not particularly fun.

Phew, the end. Now that that's over, enjoy the ending in which you manage to
thwart everyone's expectations and are generally awesome.

After you make your choice, you'll lose Yuzu, Midori, and Keisuke as party
members, and you'll gain Naoya and Kaido. You'll also get Mari and Black Frost
if you fulfilled their respective requirements.

If you knew beforehand that you wanted this route, I'd recommend trying to use
the MC and Atsuro more on Day 6, as Yuzu, Midori, and Keisuke all leave, and
because this'll make Naoya's, Kaido's, etc starting levels all a bit higher.
That's because their starting levels are affected by what your party's levels
are, so if you mostly used the MC and Atsuro, and since those other three leave
your party before the rest join...etc.

Otherwise. Highly recommend that you use Naoya - he's a good Magic-type
replacement for Yuzu and he's required for several battles - and Mari, as she's
the only other magic-oriented character. If you want to go against Lucifer in
this playthrough...well, definitely use her. Or it'll be tough.

Remember, even if your team leaders are at comparable levels to the enemies
you're fighting, you have to remember your demons as well. Really, really.
Always keep them up-to-date. If you're really struggling, that's probably why.

This is your only chance to crack Magic Yin, so you kinda might want to get
that. If it’s your first playthrough, there are so many skills here for the
taking that you might get overwhelmed. You want Mediarahan and Samarecarm, if
you can; the Wall and Barrier auto skills can wait.

So, all your enemies have a ranged attack. This could get messy if you don’t
move carefully...especially since everyone’s range overlaps. The Evil Wave
users will have 3 movement and 2 range – so with 5 spaces, you’ll have to move
within their range if you want to attack them (they don’t move otherwise).
Unless you have someone with Flight...who’ll get swarmed really quickly.

Other fun thing – some of your enemies have Barrier (auto reflect phys) and
Wall (auto reflect magic). So you don’t want your physical fighter (should be
Atsuro, honestly – he’s more versatile than Kaido) going after the guys with
Wall. Equip whatever almighty skills you have, since Barrier can’t block that.
Also note the Ban Force and Ban Fire-wielding foes.

So. Split your force in two. Have two people go around and to the left, and two
around and to the right (Atsuro should be one of these to evade Wall), and
begin slowly luring out individual Believers. If you have someone with a
Dragon- or Vile-type, that's fine; let them be the lure, so you’ll at least
deal some damage. Constantly heal, obviously; resistance to ice will also be
good against all those Ma/bufudyne-wielding Culebres. Let them attack you,
heal, and then take advantage of how you'll have Extra Turns while they won't
to quickly defeat them.

The Believers move somewhat erratically, but basically if you move so that
you’re within striking range of one of them, they’ll back up if possible. If
you’re right on the outside of their five-square attack range, they will move
towards you. So, don’t move farther than that if you can’t handle it. When
Amane gets within your range, even if they’re backed up and you’re within
striking range, they will move to attack you. Amane won’t move. If you’re
hurting, leave her for last.

Actually, really leave her for last – Amane has insane magic. Combined with
Magic Yin, this means you’ll be hurting. And you’ll find it hard to deal magic
damage to her (even almighty). Of course, if you brought along that unit with
Evil Wave/Chaos Wave, this is a really good place to use it, as Amane’s the
only unit without a ranged attack. You can eliminate her demons and strike
without worrying about Magic Yin.

If not, try to get rid of her Rangda if you can first. If you happen to have
someone with Gigajama, this might be a good time to use it on Amane. Then with
Rangda gone, your physical units might have a chance at severely damaging her
enough. If they have Phys Repel, though, they should be able to use Attack All/
Deathbound/whatever without getting backlash from the Rangda. Note that Amane
has Mediarahan and Mana Aid, so you’re in for a long fight.

Remiel, a Divine-type fusion, will also be unlocked in the Cathedral of Shadows
after this battle.

You'll get about 2200 EXP and 1500 Macca at the end.

First, you can walk on the molten lava, but you will take fire damage from
"Fanatic's Lava" at the end of your turn (ow). But, unless you have Evil Wave
or Chaos Wave, you'll have to stand on it to attack Jezebel. So you might want
all the str/null/reflect fire you can have on the teams that'll go after her.
That or use Animal Leg to move back onto not-lava-covered ground.

The Decarabias won't move towards you unless you're in their range. So. Unless
you have a team that nulls fire and can afford to spend a turn or so traversing
the lava, have your teams go around it and take care of the Decarabias. And
note Jezebel's 3x range, and move accordingly. She tends to use Maragidyne,
which is another good reason to have Null/Reflect fire. She'll also whip out
Judgement a few times, so you'll need to keep healing and/or be strong against
Mystic while you're at it.

Damage Jezebel enough and the place will revert back to a flowery garden
(meaning no lava to worry about). You'll also snap Amane out of her stupor.
Jezebel will summon up three doppelgangers of Amane (Mind Amanes). If Amane
gets possessed again, it's the end, so you'll have to defeat them and protect
her. Note that even if you defeat the Mind Amanes, they'll just keep spawning
so that there'll always be at least two on the map. So, you'll have to focus
your energy on Jezebel. And if the Mind Amane teams are slaughtering you (with
Cerberus's Deathbound and Ukano Mitama's Ma-dyne skills, this might be), really
focus all your energy on Jezebel and hold out as best as you can.

Interestingly enough, the Mind Amane teams give far more EXP than Jezebel does.
Ah well. In fact, if you're on NG+ and you're looking for a place to grind
besides/before the Lucifer battle, this isn't bad for it - a Mind Amane team
will give you about 8000+ EXP a pop, and they easily and quickly respawn.
Better than a free battle, at least.

You'll receive about 2300 EXP and 1500 Macca at the end.

A Kishin-type boss. (Four Devas is basically Kishin's Double Up + Genma's
Phantasm sans the lowered movement cost.) At level 65. Could be painful, so get
ready.

One reinforcement team appears every few turns or so. Cerberus has high Agility
and Yaksa has a devastating Deathbound, so you might want to get rid of them
with a strong ice user if you can. Ice and Almighty will also work wonders
against Bishamon.

The Rangda teams are going to be pure misery for your physical fighter (Atsuro,
Kaido, or both) and/or physical-attack demons. So be careful with your multi-
target physical attacks. It might be better to send a team of them towards
Bishamon instead, especially if they have high Vitality, which you're going to
want against him. Pierce would help against his resistance to phys, too (unless
they can wield Ice attacks).

Lucky for you, if Bishamon attacks twice, he'll be pushed pretty far down in
the turn order and you won't have to worry about him initiating attacks for a
while. Send some strong Ice users (Culebre would work really well here, with
Ma/bufudyne and Evil Wave, preventing you from getting hit), and pace yourself.
The moment one of your teams gets severely damaged, get it away from Bishamon
and healed up quickly. With Attack All + Dual Shadow, a fluke could send you
flying.

But yes. Definitely have a few users with Sama/recarm if possible, and major
healing abilities. You can try putting Ban Phys on the team with your weakest
(vitality-wise) demons for a little help.

(By the way, if you've decided to use Izuna...well, you should definitely be
using Atsuro no matter what - he's required in the final battle. Just saying.)

You'll earn about 2500 EXP and 1800 Macca at the end.

As if the not-so-subtle "I have a feeling we should be careful" and "are you
ready?" messages weren't enough warning, you get to fight two Devas here.

There are a crapload of enemies, but most of them have elemental weaknesses
that you can easily take advantage of. In particular, someone with strong elec-
type attacks should go towards Koumoku, and someone with force towards Zouchou.
Have all the Ma-dynes equipped to make it easier on yourself, as all the teams
have two of the same demon (and thus twice the susceptibility), with the
exception of the Devas' teams. You might want to send your physical attacker/s
towards the Yaksa and not the Rangda. Actually, forget the "might" part.

Otherwise, both Devas are noticeably weaker than Bishamon, and don't have as
many resistances or annoying passives. Still, both of them have Evil Wave, so
couple that with Double Up and you might get hit pretty hard if you're not
prepared. Be patient and don't let the enemies get the jump on you, and kill
the Culebres when you get a chance. Just move cautiously and keep yourself
healed, and this should go pretty smoothly.

You'll earn about 2700 EXP and 2100 Macca at the end.

So. Charming bug thing aside. Doesn't look like a particularly tough battle
with anything strange to throw at you, and you get a nice choice of skills to
crack, right?

Yeah, well. Have a magic user with a lot of MP crack Prayer during this battle
and set it (if you don't have it already). Have a Megami or two. And give
someone like Atsuro Amrita. You'll see why later. Also, a few Sama/recarms
won't hurt, and are probably necessary.

Belzaboul has an immense attack range, but it takes a while for his turn to
come up. Take advantage of that time as follows.

Once you kill two teams OR attack Belzaboul, the battle changes. Make sure that
whatever you chose to crack (that isn't on Belzaboul), you crack within those
two teams you kill. The reason why is afterwards, all the remaining teams
change into Maggots. Yes, very charming. They're far more dangerous than run-
of-the-mill demons, as they have the Spawn almighty attack. This'll deal damage
and have a fairly good chance of spawning eggs on the target, which is a status
ailment indicated by a little bug.

This is why you need all those teams with the ability to not just heal, but
cure. A few very short turns after, the eggs'll hatch and deal damage, usually
killing their host, and it'll spawn a new team of maggots on the map. So fun.
Belzaboul also has Spawn now, so you can't really avoid it. Just cure whoever
gets afflicted as quickly as possible, and revive who you need to, as you're
probably not going to be able to avoid several party members dying.

So, Belzaboul. Again, don't attack it until after the Maggots appear to
maximize your skill cracks. Spam almighty on it, use demons strong against
mystic, etc. If you have anyone that reflects force, that'd help minorly. If
the team you use to attack him has Amrita/Prayer/Affection, that'll help, as
you have a fairly good chance of getting afflicted. Just cure your way through
this battle and hold your ground (and towards the end, you should be able to
keep your party members all right next to Belzaboul so he can't strike you
without retaliation). Easily a very, very annoying battle if you let the
Maggots get out of hand, so you'll want that cure.

You'll get about 2950 EXP and 2400 Macca at the end.

Victory:
Defeat all angels

Sariel Lv: 62
Anael Lv: 62


If you missed out on cracking Mediarahan and Samarecarm, here's another great
opportunity to get those. Skill-wise, you'll want all the Almighty moves you
can equip. And definitely put Pierce on your phys attacker, as all of the
angels have phys resist. Oh, and get all the mystic resistance you can, too.

So, look at all those clusters of angels around you. Pretty painful. If your
teams aren’t so strong/under-leveled, you might want to have them move together
in one big mass around the map. Otherwise, split your forces in half and go
left and right. Have your pairs eliminate the angels team by team, and make
sure you keep everyone's HP up.

Note that you do want to thoroughly eliminate the teams, as the Kazfiels are
packing Samarecarm, and the Aniels and Norns have Mediarahan and Prayer. If you
let them constantly heal this will drag on forever, so don't.

Also make sure you have enough MP. Sariel will use Purging Light from time to
time, which will hit everyone on the map for MP damage. It's a mystic-type
attack, so if you have Anti-/Null Mystic on your team leaders and demons, that
will definitely help. (Plus, the angels are packing Judgement - which halves
(or quarters, in the case of your team leaders) your HP.

Anael and Sariel will move towards you, unfortunately. Be really careful -
Anael has Makarakarn, so Almighty will be good against him. His Attack All will
hurt, so keep healed. Sariel has Beast Eye, which means you can expect him to
cast Tetrakarn every fight. So, since you can't Pierce through phys reflect,
don't send Atsuro or Kaido towards him at all and have them take care of Anael.

If you're taking way too much damage, you might want to resort to using Evil or
Chaos Wave users, provided that your teams can do enough damage without Extra
Turns. Or you might do a one-two kind of strategy where the distance attacker
goes first, and then another fighter finishes the team off and takes much less
damage than they would've otherwise.

You'll get about 3050 EXP and 2600 Macca at the end.

I'd advise you to crack Victory Cry off Belberith and three of the four
available auto skills off the Believers (especially Rage Soul and Grace).
Unless you still don't have Samarecarm and Mediarahan, in which case.

Phantasm or Flight would be pretty helpful for this battle, as you could then
pass through the obstacles/looping area where you deploy. Then, with the
bridges sealed off, you'll have to send two teams to the control area (the
consoles must be activated simultaneously), and two teams to either end to wait
for the bridges to go up. If you have Phantasm/Flight, put it on the teams
heading towards the consoles, as they'll be able to leap up onto the altar and
fight Belberith without having to double all the way back around. Devil Speed's
the next best choice.

You also want to put Ma/zandyne and Almighty abilities on your main Belberith
attackers. Physical fighters with Pierce are also good.

Get within three spaces of the Believers and they will move to attack you.
Otherwise, they won't move. The two Believers on the sides will make their
COMPs go berserk upon defeat, creating those red demon-generating spaces where
they were standing. When you defeat the two Believers standing on the switch
activation spots, a reinforcement each will appear on the red spaces by
Belberith. You'll probably want to pick up those COMPs to stop the
reinforcements, especially if you're struggling here.

Against the Believer with Rage Soul, you'll want a team that has Devil Speed
(for the +15 initiative), insane agility, or a ton of phys resist fighters,
otherwise that team's going to hit you real hard. And don't forget the teams
that have Barrier and Wall and accidentally use really powerful phys or magic
that'll just reflect on you. You might want to send your physical fighter
toward the Barrier user and vice versa; note that Barrier does not block
Almighty, at least.

Belberith is way down below in the turn order, as you'll probably get to move
two or three times before his first attack. Unfortunately, he can target anyone
he likes, so you can't really do anything about that. If one of your teams is
pretty weakened, he'll definitely target them, so be warned.

Belberith's weak to force and has Maziodyne and Mabufudyne. So, no demons that
are weak to elec or ice. If you have any that can reflect, that's even better.
Victory Cry will heal a good chunk of HP and MP, so you want to be dealing a
good 500 damage or so every time you engage him at the least. Though, if you
have a souped-up magic-oriented MC and/or Yuzu, either of them with Holy Dance
should easily hit for 500-ish damage on their own. A Megami with Holy Dance
will do just as much damage, if not more (and you really should have Norn or
Amaterasu by now, anyway).

By the way, if you need to fuse Holy Dance onto anyone, just buy a few Ym with
Watchful. Let them get experience (especially if they haven't learned Holy
Dance yet), fuse them into a Mitama that'll get some experience, and fuse it to
whatever demon. You'll get Holy Dance, +3 Strength, and maybe a boost to other
stats as well. Not a bad deal when you make this much Macca at this point.

You'll earn about 3200 EXP and 2800 Macca at the end.


   NOTE: The free battle at the top of the Hills building can net you an
         awesome skill crack. Shiva, a Deity, appears very, very rarely - I'd
         say about 5% of the time or so - but he has Megidolaon and Victory
         Cry. This is definitely where you want to get Megidolaon from, so.
         Keep fighting/retreating from/restarting the free battle until you
         see it.

So, final battle. Be prepared, obviously. No wimpy demons (yours should all be
pretty high-tier, maybe with average base levels in the mid-50s - if you're on
New Game+, though, you should easily have some base level 60s), because you do
not have the MP to be wasting on Samarecarm every other turn in this battle. 
Have a few Tyrant- (if you've unlocked Loki, here's a great battle for him) and
Divine-type demons (Kazfiel, Remiel) to keep your MP up. You'll be using things
like Holy Dance a ton in this battle, and you don't want to run out. Having a
Deity (Shiva, Asura) with Awakening to up the strength of your Almighty attacks
can help, too. And obviously you want healing and cure.

Oh, and put Ma/ziodyne on your main magic-using attackers. Along with the usual
Almighty, etc. Babel's final form is weak to elec. You might also want to put
Ma/zandyne on a few people, as well.

About every three turns or so two reinforcements will appear in the northwest
and northeast red circles. Unfortunately, they're not those demon-spawning
squares caused by COMPs that you can pick up, so get used to them.

The first Babel form shouldn't be too hard. Rush it, spam almighty and/or
characters with pierce, and it should go down quickly.

Once that's done, Babel shows its true form. Well, not quite - it summons Beldr
and Belial, first of all. Oh yeah. And yep, only the MC can damage Belial. All
of your teams will be clustered around the organ in the center.

Don't worry about having a Kishin on the MC – Beldr has low HP, and if you're
at a good level, he won't be a problem at all. And Belial's still weak to ice.
Defeat them, and a ramp will appear leading to Babel – with Jezebel guarding
it. This'll lead to a series of fights – first her, then Beelzebub, then
Belberith. Don't worry about Beelzebub's spawn – once you defeat it, the
ailment will disappear from anyone who had it. If you defeat it fast enough,
that is.

All the Bels have the same resistances and weaknesses that they did the first
time you fought them. So implement the same strategies you used before, etc.

After all that, Babel will split open and you'll be able to fight it. It's now
got an infinite attack range and a new repertoire that includes Megidolaon. 
Basically you'll want to be kind of careful at this point. If you have a slow
healer in your lineup, you can have them heal on the assumption that Babel'll
deal pretty bad damage with Megidolaon or Attack All, especially if Babel has
an Extra Turn.

Babel does have a weakness to elec, and Atsuro/Kaido + pierce will blow through
his Str to phys. Of course, you should still be spamming almighty as well.
Otherwise, this is a huge battle of endurance. Suspend here and there, because
dealing with a Dual Shadow'd Megidolaon is not particularly fun.

And...the end. Congrats, you're now the overlord. Enjoy your new evil
expression (really?) and your awesome black cape.

Skill Crack: Mediarahan, Samarecarm, Gigajama, Maziodyne, Life Lift, Ice Repel


Your skill crack options are actually somewhat limited as four of these skills
are on Laksmi, and there are only two of them. Go for Mediarahan and
Samarecarm, to make the final battles easier. And oh you definitely want both
of them.

You should probably be at level 50+ for this battle. By this point you should
also be seriously upgrading your demons. (It'd be really good to have, say, a
Tyrant or two, Laksmi, Culebre, and so on.) The Yaksa teams will give you a
harder time than Loki will, in all likelihood. Yay Deathbound when you're not
the one using it.

Send two people straight up the center with strong Agi skills. The other two
team members should back them up, taking care of the Seiryuu-Yaksa teams with
Zan.

Watch out for Loki – if you move within four spaces of him or you wipe out all
four demon teams below him, he and the Laksmi will move towards you. In
addition, he'll create three copies of himself. Honestly, the copies shouldn't
give you too much trouble – my Lv: 50 Atsuro killed one copy in one go with
Deathbound. Plus they give pretty nice EXP. Loki will regenerate his copies
after several turns, though.

You can tell which one's the real Loki by finding the one that has a shadow -
the copies don't. If the one you attack says "good job, you found me" (or
Atsuro couldn't kill him on his own, as was in my case, haha), then you've
found the real one.

After your MC goes twice, two Yaksa teams appear at the bottom. One has an
Abaddon, which has chaos wave, so be careful about that. Just don't get ganged
up on by the Lokis and you should be all right.

   NOTE: Having a hard time? Just because your team leaders are at okay
         levels and you're using good strategy isn't everything. Make
         sure you have the latest demons. If you're walking into these
         battles with demons at levels...oh, early 40s and lower, you
         might have a hard time.

Seiten Taisei Lv: 53, Izuna Lv: 59, Arioch Lv: 55


So, at first glance, the battle doesn't look -too- bad. Just like what the
easiest route's final battle should be. ...Then Amane and Izuna show up (either
after your team goes twice, or you kill all the demon teams). Hopefully your
demons are up to par - I had Hecate and Astaroth, a Culebre or two, Laksmi, and
Cerberus, among others, which made the battle go by much better.

First little note: at the beginning, Sariel uses Purging Light, which is a
target-all attack that hits your MP. Ouch. It's a Mystic-type attack, so your
team should have pretty good resistance to that by now. Keeping around demons
with Tyranny, Blood Wine, and Drain should also help. (Be sure to put Drain on
your strongest magic-using team leader.)

If you're unprepared, you will get slaughtered. Amane has Samarecarm and can
revive demon teams you've already killed, and Izuna's Chaos Wave can down you
before you have a chance to attack. So your priority in this battle is actually
to eliminate the reinforcements when they appear.

Thus. Fight all the demons close by - take note of Kazfiel's annoying
Samarecarm - but keep at least three teams near the entrance, where Amane and
Izuna will show up. You'll want two people with Evil Wave (preferably) to take
on Amane, and one particularly heavy hitter to go after Izuna. Not Atsuro - her
team reflects or nulls physical attacks. Getting rid of Izuna's Arioch should
be the first priority, as you won't have to worry about Chaos Wave any more.
After that, do as you will.

With Amane, Evil Wave is the safer approach. Norn has Prayer and several
Ma-dyne attacks, and Amane has Megidolaon. Not fun to be hit with. But the
really annoying thing about fighting her is her Grace auto ability - it fully
heals her team (doesn't revive, thankfully) every turn. So you'll want to knock
out her demons first and then try to eliminate Amane in one turn. I managed
with Atsuro who had a Deathbound-laden team for the latter part. If you need
to Drain her MP, that's fine as well.

Otherwise. You'll probably get hit by another round of Purging Light, and
Sariel and Anael will move if you get too close. Evil Wave will help whittle
them down while maintaining a safe distance, and Tyranny will slow down their
turns. With Beast Eye, Sariel will use Tetrakarn every fight, and Anael
sometimes uses Makarakarn, so attack accordingly. (Remember, shields and
reflects don't do anything against Almighty-type.) Overall, the battle can be
immensely challenging - if you don't know what's coming.

And yep, that's the end of Yuzu's route. Enjoy the ending...well, it's not
particularly cheery, but you know what I mean. Yay New Game+?

Before you ask, yes, it gets really, really hard with each passing phase. Phase
2 starts when you whittle him down to about 60-65% of his HP, and Phase 3 when
he's down to 20%. He heals fully each time. No, you can't stop him.

It'd be better not to fight this battle on Naoya's or Kaido's routes. I'd
definitely recommend against doing so if you didn't get Mari and/or your MC's
not a magic nuke (high magic and agility) - with just Naoya having the ability
to use Almighty, you'll be screwed. It'll definitely be possible to fight him
on the route if you have at least the MC and Naoya geared for powerful magic,
depending on your strategy.

If you know it's the playthrough you're fighting him, be sure to use magic-
oriented characters. Definitely soup up the MC's stats. Yuzu and Midori are
good choices, Amane's not as good as Yuzu but depending on your strategy, as
good as Midori, and Atsuro or Gin will be helpful for the first two phases
plus getting rid of reinforcements. Basically, the team leaders should have
good magic and agility. Amane doesn't quite have great agility, and Izuna's
lack of magic means she'll basically die from Megidoladyne. Up to you.

Otherwise, I'd advise fighting Lucifer during your last playthrough - saves a
bit of grinding. Depending on your strategy, you'll want your demons and team
leaders to be in their high 70s at the very, very, very least, mid-to-upper
80s, or, well, 99. If you're in high 70s, you'll need magic above 30.
More later.

The major challenge to this fight is...well. Starting Phase Two, Lucifer will
drop Megidoladyne on you, which is as nasty as it sounds - an Almighty attack
that hits everyone on the map. It does more damage each time it's used, 
increasing by...well, from what I observed, about 50% with each strike. The
first strike alone will kill your teams if they're not at least level 82 (Yuzu,
Naoya, and a magic nuke MC might last in their late 70s). So, pretty much by
the time the third Megidoladyne rolls around (which Lucifer will use often),
you're pretty much dead.

Here's a breakdown of the three phases:

-- Phase 1: Lucifer doesn't attack until you attack him first. And then he only
   attacks once per turn. No big deal, even if he has infinite range.
-- Phase 2: Lucifer's turn automatically comes up, and he'll launch
   Megidoladyne. Ouch. He now has Dragon Eye, meaning 3x attacks per turn.
   And no, it's not a typo - his Hassohappa really does anywhere from 4000 to
   over 9000 damage. However, he doesn't have Pierce any more, so any kind of
   Phys defense will save you there.
-- Phase 3: Argh, he healed again. And still uses Megidoladyne. And...has Phys
   -Repel-, and Elec Drain + Maziodyne. You don't want Elec Repel equipped
   because of this phase. Oh, he also has Drain. So, be sure you have Blood
   Wine, Tyranny, Mana Aid, Victory Cry, etc. Or Drain, if he didn't suck up
   all of your MP. ...And he still has Dragon Eye.

So. You have three options: 1) Grind to level 99 and slug it out, 2) Tyrant
lock strategy, 3) Recarm strategy.

Option 1...if you want, and you have the time and aren't bored by grinding, go
ahead. Megidoladyne might still kill you, though. Your entire team will have
to be armed with Phys Drain/Repel, and you'll have to use very strong magic
users. Gigajama could help to keep you alive, as long as you put it on a demon
that'll move before Lucifer does. If that team has Phys Repel/Drain/Null,
you'll definitely survive. (This would work better with Tyrant Lock, too.)

Option 2. You need at least two Tyrants to make this work, obviously. This can
also slightly work in conjunction with the Recarm strategy. Unless you grinded
massively with Hecate, the two demons will be Loki and Astaroth (and some say
using Astaroth uses too much grinding also, up to you). Basically, put the
Tyrants on your two best magic users, who'll spend the whole battle primarily
fighting Lucifer/trying to survive his attacks. (Gigajama + Phys resistance
will be really good for that.) Pair at least one of the Tyrants with a Kishin,
who can Double Up. Tyranny delays foes' turns, so if you keep pushing Lucifer's
turn back, he won't be able to use Megidoladyne, and you'll be safe from that.
...Not that this guarantees you'll survive three hits of Megidolaon or
Hassohappa, but.

Option 3. Some people call it cheap; some people say it's a legit strategy. It
definitely allows for the least amount of grinding, though, but you'll have to
watch your stats and abuse suspends liberally (granted, you'll be doing that
no matter what strategy you're using, but). Lucifer's agility is 28. If you're
initiating all the fights, your agility can be somewhere around 26 and ideally
at 30. Your two demons should have 32 agility at least - just needs to be
higher than the team leader's. You need two teams that'll do this. Yuzu will
hit 26 agility somewhere in the mid-80s, which should be good enough - you
might have to reset a few times if/when the RNG hates you, but otherwise.

Oh, and the skills. Your two team leaders should have Recarm/Samarecarm, and
your demons should have Drain/holy Dance/Recarm. Those'll be the MC and Yuzu
(or Naoya - the other magic users aren't going to be fast enough), basically.
And you want a Pierce+Phys Jump'ing Atsuro.

The recarm strategy basically takes advantage of the fact that recarm'd teams
automatically go right after, turn-wise. So, if team 1 dies, team 2 recarms,
attacks, and dies, team 1 goes right after, recarms team 2, attacks, and dies,
and it keeps repeating. This is why you need high agility - your team's two
demons will attack with Holy Dance/Drain, and - in phase two, your team will
attack and you'll hope Lucifer's attack kills the leader only (that or you have
enough recarm power to revive a whole team) - but in phase three, your leader
will attack with Mighty Hit or Deathbound, which should repel back on them and
kill them - before Lucifer can attack. Basically, you'll never let him attack
or use Megidoladyne, and you'll keep chipping him down. AWesome, right?

Note that for this to work, the two team leaders obviously can't have Phys
Null, Drain, or Repel (Lucifer doesn't have Pierce in the last two phases).

So the strategy's basically to whittle Lucifer down to the second phase, where
Atsuro and the other teams will bludgeon him to 20% HP, and then where the two
recarm teams' leaders will keep killing themselves via phys repel while you
slowly get his HP down.

Tyrant lock can inadvertently work with this, a bit - it acts like a Double Up
of sorts, after all, letting your Tyrants drive Lucifer's turn way back.

Note that the strategy's not perfect - in her upper 80s, my Yuzu's Deathbound
couldn't do enough damage to kill herself. This is why you want Recarm, not
Samarecarm - your chars might not be strong enough to kill themselves
otherwise, which'll leave you open to Megidolaon, Hassohappa, or Drain. Plus
it saves MP.

So, a few bullet points:
 - Don't equip Elec Repel. You can have Fire/Ice Repel, but they'll only be
   useful for the first part, alas.
 - If you're using Tyrant Lock + Gigajama, equip Phys Null/Drain/Repel.
 - If you're using Recarm, don't equip Phys Null/Drain/Repel. If not, equip.
 - Tyranny, Blood Wine, Awakening - good stuff.
 - You definitely should have a Megami like Amaterasu - best magic-using demon
   race, with high MP to match.
 - Don't bother with Vile types (Lucifer's range makes them not so useful).
 - Recommended auto skills: you can never go wrong with Blitzkrieg. Magic Yang
   is probably a must. Atsuro could use Full Might (-not- Rage Soul), and the
   last one's up to you. Magic Yin, while kinda cool, might not be entirely
   sustainable. Ban Phys or Wall could help. Do not equip Barrier.
 - If you're not using Drain and Holy Dance, something's wrong with you.
 - Atsuro/Gin/your physical attacker should have Pierce and Phys Jump. Their
   attacks depend on if you're using the Recarm strategy or not.

Overall, grinding's one of the most important things - the higher your level,
the less damage Lucifer will do to you. If you have the patience to get to 99,
good for you. If not, prepare your strategy very carefully - or don't fight the
battle at all, as it's not really necessary. Just for completion.

Oh, and you'll also get the Lucifer fusion at the end, though he comes at 99
and will be a bit overkill by then. Still cool, though?

       enemy you can crack the skill from
[Any additional notes or clarification.]

In regards to where you can crack skills, I tried to include as many battle
opportunities that I could. Sometimes, enemies show up earlier than usual in
free battles (it's RNG, so I can't list exactly what enemies you'd encounter),
and sometimes, enemies have different skills than they normally would.

If you keep up in the game, you're bound to crack everything you can sooner or
later. You don't need to freak out. The only things you can possibly miss out
on permanently are Last Day auto skills, Megidolaon, and Victory Cry, really
(and the latter two, not so much, either).

   NOTE: In regards to Last Day skill cracks, it'll indicate which route the
         enemy's found on. Note that on Yuzu's route, you don't fight the Bels
         or the Devas, and you can't fight all the free battle demons
         (basically anything above level 56).

       Definitely comparable with Rage Soul. An ensured Critical attack
       usually means an ensured Extra Turn, and it can also take away
       enemies' Extra Turns. Plus, you're not locked into Attacking all
       the time, and you can use things like Hassohappa or Deathbound.

       Pretty good damage-wise and a huge favorite of many, especially if

Megami:

      Heal/Cure a team
      Range: 4
      [Easily better than Devotion or Charm, and highly recommended.
       It'll probably heal at least 60% of each team member's HP, and
       it'll cure status ailments. It might not be Prayer, but the range
       will surely help.]

Vile:
      Chaos Wave - Pr: passive
      Rng up 3x, Move -1
      Cost 2x, no EX Turn
      [The movement and speed cost makes this one hard to use, unless
       your main has a New Game+ movement of 5. Enemies with this are a
       royal pain, however. Pair it with Animal Leg for a sniper of
       sorts, or Flight to cancel out the movement penalty. Note that
       even if you attack an enemy while you're right next to it, you'll
       never have Extra Turns if you have a demon with this.]

Snake:
      Constrict - Pr: passive
      Foes near team: Bound
      Engage priority
      [You'll always have +10 Initiative when enemies attack, which gives
       you a better chance of getting Extra Turns. It doesn't kick in
       when you're the one attacking first. Also, enemies that are next
       to you have their movement reduced to 1.]

Dragon:
      Evil Wave - Pr: passive
      Range up 2x
      [No movement penalty makes it better than Chaos Wave in most
       respects - most enemies won't be able to attack you, and if you're
       moving your teams in a group, this should soften up enemies
       enough. Definitely good to have. Like with Chaos Wave, note that
       even if you attack an enemy while you're right next to it, you'll
       never have Extra Turns if you have a demon with this.]

Divine:
      Blood Wine - HP: 20% - Pr: heal
      Convert HP to MP
      Level dependant
      [Pretty useful, especially if you're the kind of player who always
       runs out of MP. Tyranny would work as well, though... The benefit
       to Blood Wine is that it's HP- rather than battle-dependant.
       Usually, it doesn't restore as much MP as Tyranny, in my
       experience, but you can always rotate around a Divine-type
       amongst your party to restore MP in long, grueling battles.]

Avian:
      Flight - Pr: passive
      Ignore obstacles
      Move +1 (No stack)
      [Good for racing to certain points, i.e. battles where you have to
       save civilians, or battles where there's a ton of
       debris/obstacles.]

Fallen:
      Sacrifice - Pr: passive
      HP, MP up when foe dies (Lvl dependant)
      [If the demon with Sacrifice lands the finishing blow, the entire
       team will get a little bit of their HP and MP replenished.]

Avatar:
      Switch - MP: 5% - Pr: passive
      Switch positions
      Range: 6
      [So very useful in many battles, especially the save-the-civilian
       ones. Not only will you get closer to the enemies faster (you can
       move a potential 9-11 spaces in one turn with this trick), but
       you'll get the civilian out of harm's way at the same time. You
       can also use this to move a badly damaged team out of range, or
       string together a number of attacks by having teams Switch in,
       etc. Very versatile, and it fits in many strategies.

Beast:
      Animal Leg - Pr: passive
      Move after attacking
      (Not stackable)
      [Pretty useful, seeing as it'll double your move. If you're trying
       to race to a certain point and there are enemies close to you at
       the beginning, it'll let you propel your team pretty far. The
       speed cost for the extra movement is lower than that of normal
       movement.]

Wilder:
      Devil Speed - HP: 15-20% depending on level - Pr: passive
      Move = 7 after use
      Engage priority
      [One of the classic moves for save-the-civilian battles. A little
       bonus to this one is its +15 Initiative you'll get when you attack
       after using it.]

Genma:
      Phantasma - Pr: passive
      Ignore obstacles
      Move cost: Half
      [It doesn't give you the extra move that Flight does, but it helps
       your overall Speed with the lessened movement cost. And you can
       move through obstacles. Definitely a very handy skill to have.]

Fairy:
      Charm - MP: 10-20% depending on level - Pr: heal
      Recovers HP, miracles happen
      Range: 3
      [Good at the beginning of the game, but its usefulness wanes later
       on. Affection and even Devotion are better for ranged healing, and
       Media/rahan will definitely heal more. Charm can, on occasion, up
       your Critical Hit % or even heal you fully (though that last one's
       rare). It can also lower your movement, though, so...overall,
       don't bother when you have better healing options later.]

Tyrant:
      Tyranny - Pr: passive
      MP up when damaged
      Foe turns delayed
      [One of the best, best racial skills by far. Free MP replenishment
       is always a bonus, especially when you're using Ma-dyne skills
       every turn, and the foe turn delay will really help when you don't
       want a big boss on the Last Day to whip out Megidolaon as often.
       Just surround it with people who have Tyrant-type demons and you're
       all set.]

Kishin:
      Double Up - Pr: passive
      Can normal attack 2x
      (Not stackable)
      [Another really good racial skill. You can attack twice per turn.
       Say you start out in front of an enemy - you attack it, then move,
       then you attack another team. It'll push you back pretty far in
       the battle order, though - which can be helpful on certain
       missions, i.e. if reinforcements or enemy turns (or Naoya's well-
       known 3-turn challenge) are solely dependant on how many times
       the MC's gone.]

Touki:
      Aggravate - HP: 13-18% depending on level - Pr: protect
      Allies: critical dmg 1 turn after use
      [Eh, kinda useful. Painful if you're up against it. Pretty good for
       inflicting immense damage, up to a point, if it's on a team of
       physical attackers.]

Jaki:
      Bind - HP: 15-22% depending on level - Pr: passive
      Adj. foe team: Bound
      Range: 3
      [Good for levels where you're trying to keep the enemy from
       escaping or you're trying to protect civilians. Very good to have
       handy during, say, the Kudlak battles.]

Femme:
      Devotion - MP: 15-25% depending on level - Pr: passive
      Recovers HP
      Range: 3
      [It's pretty much just plain-vanilla healing, with some range.
       Healing's HP-dependant - it'll heal up to half of the HP that the
       user demon has at the moment. So if only has 50 HP left or
       something...it's going to be a little useless. Better than Charm
       in many cases, not as good as Affection.]

Elements and Mitamas do not have racial skills.

At the beginning of the 1st day, you'll gain access to the demon auction. This
is the only way you can get new demons for the rest of the game, aside from
fusing - which needs demons you've bought in the auction, otherwise you'll run
out of fusion material rather quickly. Macca's the currency used here.

The auction refreshes after 30 in-game minutes, or if you reset the game.

Demons have star rankings of 1 to 5, with one being the worst quality (stats
lowered by at least 2, some skills reduced in power or eliminated), 3 being
average, and 4 or 5 being excellent (stat boosts, higher level, better skills).
A demon can only have a star level of 4 or 5, not both, and 1 or 2, not both.
Basically, you can get three types of a specific demon: crappy, average, and
good.

There are four auction levels, which get unlocked as you progress throughout
the game:

 - Basic:    demons at levels 1-15
 - Gold:     demons at levels 16-30
 - Platinum: demons at levels 31-50
 - Occult:   demons at levels 51+, and Mitamas


Here's how the auction works. Pick the demon you want. You'll get the choice to
either buy it now, or bid for it. If you bid, you can lower the price to about
75-90% of the original value, depending on the demon's star ranking (the higher
it is, the more expensive it'll be). You have 5 seconds to bid high enough so
that the other bidders will drop out; the longer the auction lasts, the less
inclined they'll be to drop out. So you generally want to end the auction by
3.5 seconds.

You can drop out of the auction at any time. If you decide to opt out of the
auction after you've won, you won't have to pay any Macca, but your auction
ranking will go down.

A few rules and regulations:
 - For a demon to be available in the auction, you have to have fought it at
   least once.
 - Unique demons (ones you can only have one copy of at one time) can't be
   bought.
 - Some of the 4- /5-star demons will come with skills that you can't get when
   fusing them, so be on the lookout for that.

Oh, and. Sometimes, after you place your bid, the auction will freak out on you
and one of several things can happen:
 - You have to pay double the original price.
 - You only have to pay half the original price.
 - You have to pay...nothing. (Awesome.)
 - Turns out, you're getting a demon different from the originally specified
   one.

If something bad happens, well, at least if you default, it won't bring down
your auction ranking. If you really wanted that demon and it got switched out,
you can just soft reset or try again after 30 in-game minutes have passed.

|25. Fusions                                                            [2501]|

                                   ................................ [2502]} //}

In the middle of the 1st Day or so, you'll gain access to the Cathedral of
Shadows, where you can fuse demons. Unlike past SMT games, you won't get access
to a compendium, but you do have a search function where you can look up demons
and how to make them.

Note that there are two restrictions on what will appear in your search: the
demon can only be five or fewer levels above you, and you had to have had in
your possession at least one combination of demons that'll allow you to fuse
that fusion. (Doesn't mean you had to have owned those two demons at the same
time, though.)

But, you say, if you have access to the auctions, why fuse? Several reasons for
that:
 - There are certain types of demons that will never appear in the auctions - 
   Megami, Divine, Deity, Vile, Tyrant. Naturally, they have some of the best
   racial skills, too.
 - Fused demons can inherit their parents' skills. They cannot inherit grayed-
   out skills, however. And new to this SMT version, you can choose which
   skills will be inherited, which saves so much reloading time, honestly.
 - For several races, their highest-tier demons cannot be found in the auction.
 - Unique demons (ones you can only have one copy of at one time) can only be
   fused (and are rarely seen as enemies, too).
 - If your demons have leveled up a bit and have nice stat boosts, resulting
   fused demons can get stat bonuses too. (More to come on the specifics
   later.)

So, the moral of the story is: fuse and be happy. Etc, etc.

{ // C. Bonus Stats ......................
                                   ................................ [2504]} //}

There are four ways for a demon to get extra stat points:
 - You buy a 4- or 5-star demon at the auction.
 - The demon levels up.
 - You fuse the demon with a Mitama.
 - You fuse two demons already possessing bonus stat points, and their
   resulting demon will also gain bonus stats.

Note that there is a limit to the amount of stat boosts a demon can get via
Mitamas/fusion bonus, which goes up as the demon's (current) level goes up. The
stats you gain via level up don't affect this limit.

If you surpass the limit, when you next try to fuse that demon with a Mitama,
that stat will increase by 3, but other stats will decrease by 1-3 points, to
offset the limit. Also, when fusing two demons who've gained a lot of bonus
points via Mitamas or leveling up or whatever, the new demon they'll fuse into
will have a bonus limit that'll cap the possible stat increase this new demon
will get.


{ // D. Mitama Strategy ..................
                                   ................................ [2505]} //}

Mitamas are fairly useless on their own, but you can fuse them with other
demons to up that demon's stats (it'll keep all EXP and skills, etc).

When you have enough money to try this (usually on NG+), here's a trick to make
souped-up Mitamas that'll not only increase the one stat by 3 points, but will
also increase other stats by a lot as well.

Four demons in the auction come with Watchful - Garm (Wilder), Heimdall
(Genma), Ym (Dragon), Nekomata (Beast), and Lorelei (Fairy). Fuse them into
elements:

 - Wilder --> Erthys
 - Genma, Fairy --> Aeros
 - Dragon, Beast --> Flaemis

So, Lorelei and Nekomata (or the other way around, whichever) are pretty
redundant. And to get Aquans, fuse Garm with something like Makara, which'll
get you a Megami.

You can let these Elements sit around for a while, gaining EXP with Watchful
while you keep doing your thing. Whenever you feel like it, you can fuse them
into whatever Mitamas you want. And, especially if you're on the Last Day, they
can sit around for a while too. They'll level up and get nice stat boosts. When
you eventually fuse them with your demons, the stat gains will be incredible.

Of course, note that there is a stat bonus cap (for stats you get from fusion),
so eventually this won't be very useful. But for a while, especially if you
have demons that never got high stat gains from fusion, this'll help.

You can also use the souped-up Elements to make a demon of one type into a
higher-level demon of that type, especially if you keep coming across one demon
that gets commonly used in the best fusions at the end. E.g. Aniel (Divine) +
Flaemis = Kazfiel, which I ended up fusing maybe...a million of, I dunno.

Also, if magnetite just isn't cutting it for you and you need to graft Holy
Dance onto a few demons, Ym --> Flaemis --> Mitama with Holy Dance and awesome
stats.

|28. Recommended Skill Setups                                           [2801]|
=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=

So very tentative, for now. I honestly don't know if people really need this - 
most of the "best demons" (endgame, at least) are pretty much agreed upon. I
might just do a quick thing on some good skill sets. Drop me a line with your
thoughts?

Various skill set ideas:

__ Jump + ___ Rise

 - These do stack. So the damage done will be 1.5 x 1.2. If you need that extra
   bit of power to wipe out your enemies in one blow or you're going against,
   say, Belial and you need to do a ton of ice damage, this'll work.

Magic Yin + Mana Aid/Victory Cry (+ ___ Jump/Rise)

 - The damage you do with this combination will be extreme - 1.5 x 1.5/1.2. For
   longer battles you'll definitely want that team's members to have some kind
   of mana recovery ability, otherwise you'll be sucked dry pretty quickly. If
   you can afford it, stacking Jump and Rise will give you even more power.

Magic Yang + a team with Holy Dance/Megidolaon + Blood Wine/Tyranny
(+ Drain, + Awakening)

 - Even if this team's MP gets drained, why does it matter? You'll be able to
   recover eventually anyway. Awakening'll give you Magic Yin without the large
   MP cost, if you choose to use it. If you're in for a long battle somewhere,
   this kind of setup will definitely keep you going for a long time. Magic
   Yang probably won't hurt you then, either, as you usually can't drain all
   the MP of those bosses anyway (and they benefit from Magic Yang as well).


Deathbound/Hassohappa + Phys Jump/Rise + Pierce + Phys Repel (OR + Life Aid/
Life Lift, OR Attack All)

 - For any physical fighter, you'll want Pierce and Phys Jump. Don't use
   something like Life Surge if you're using moves like Deathbound - Life Aid
   and Lift will replenish your HP and keep it high, which is what you want for
   HP-dependant damage-type attacks.
 - I prefer Phys Reflect to Aid/Lift, though, because if you run into a team
   with Tetrakarn or Phys Repel, it'll keep it from turning into a messy,
   deadly situation (your Pierce will reflect back on yourself if you're using
   something like Phys Drain, too).
 - I also prefer leaving Attack All off my phys attacker, since you need those
   passive slots for other things, and it's easier to just have them Deathbound
   and then get healed afterwards.

Rage Soul + Attack All + Phys Jump/Rise + Pierce + Phys Reflect

 - Pretty insane phys. attack damage here - 2 x 1.5/1.2. The problem with this
   setup is that you're limited to attacking only. If you're against a team
   with Phys Repel - aka Rangdas and Murmurs, or the last Lucifer form, you're
   beyond screwed.

Full Might + Attack All/Deathbound/Hassohappa + Phys Jump/Rise + Pierce + Phys
Repel

 - I like Full Might a lot more. One, it offers more flexibility - if you don't
   want to attack, you won't have to. The other thing is, though it doesn't
   give you x2 attack, it gives you criticals - which will give you Extra Turns
   and eliminate your enemies' ETs, potentially giving you the chance to do
   a bit more damage than Rage Soul would, especially in boss fights.

|29. Events and Route Outlines                                          [2901]|
=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=

In general, an event with the corresponding person will advance their route.
Sometimes, another character's event will affect certain routes or your getting
another character on your team, however. And sometimes, one of the 6/7 route
characters' events are mandatory for the main plot.

I've tried to give a brief overview of each non-route character's events and
what role they play. Most of them either 1) do nothing, 2) have a few events
that are mandatory but otherwise do nothing, or 3) unlock a character for use
on the Final Day. Note that even though some of these "do nothing," they'll
still give you interesting story bits, especially about individual characters
who otherwise don't get an opportunity to appear in the main plot much. But for
route completion's sake...yeah, they can be ignored.


Haru should be bundled with Gin as theirs is a joint route of sorts, but all of
her events either go towards their route or the main plot anyway.

   NOTE: If you want to get any route other than Yuzu's, you -have- to
         save Haru on the 4th Day at 17:00. Otherwise, you can't fight
         the second Bel battle, etc etc. (At least, I'm fairly sure about
         this one, let me know if it turned out differently for you.)

Honda...really doesn't seem to affect any route, after his mandatory event on
the 2nd day or so. So, ignore him. Same for the joint events he appears in.

Izuna has almost all plot-mandatory events.

Keisuke's events mostly are mandatory for the plot (namely battles and all of
the 5th Day craziness). There are a couple that you don't need, though.

Mari's events mostly determine whether or not you can use her as a fighter on
the Last Day (unless you take Yuzu's route, in which case she can't be used).

Midori has several events that contribute to getting Black Frost as a fighter
 - the only demon fighter you can have. Basically, make sure to choose her
optional battle on the 3rd Day, and her event that comes afterwards.

Shoji tends to disseminate information that plays a key role in the plot and
Atsuro's and Amane's routes, but save a few events in the early days, hers
aren't necessary.

???/flashy gigolo guy affects Naoya's route the most. Most of his events are
pretty much mandatory for the main plot anyway, though.

There are several blue events titled "Mysterious man" or "Mysterious woman."
These pretty much comprise strange individuals talking about humanity and
demons, and sort of contribute points to getting Naoya's or Amane's routes.

   NOTE: Specific answers to various dialogue questions -do- matter. Not
         all of them, obviously, but some of them very specifically affect
         things. I haven't hacked the game so I'm not 100% about this, but
         the game probably tallies up points depending on how you answered
         questions and what attitudes you've expressed.

         Either way, it's doubtlessly a good idea not to sound wimpy and
         always go, "Wah I want to get out of the lockout" / "It's useless
         we're all going to die" / "Let's just run away" / etc etc. That's
         no way to be a good video game hero...and the wimping out option's
         already available by default, anyway (escaping the lockout,
         Yuzu's route).


Below are brief notes on each of the routes. The event flowcharts below contain
mostly all the events that pertain to the character. This includes battles and
the mandatory ones.

   NOTE: For all routes, on the 6th Day at 12:00, events with that route's
         character will appear if you have completed their sequences and
         unlocked their route. Picking this event will secure their route.
         The exceptions are Yuzu's, as it's a default, and Gin's, whose
         battle with Azuma appears at 12:00 but whose route confirmation
         event shows up at 13:00 or so.

         Note that if you tallied up a bunch of answers in dialogue and
         email that really go against the route (i.e. being too holy for
         Naoya, being too demonic for Amane...I jest, mostly), getting
         the event won't get you the route. So, in a sense, the events
         which 'secure' the routes really mean you've just come to the
         end of the chain of events that route has to offer.


Flowchart Key:
 *  - Event cannot be skipped.
      (Note that all [BATTLE]s by their nature are plot-oriented and cannot be
       skipped, unless [OPTIONAL] is indicated.)


{// A: Amane ............................
                                  .................................. [2902] //}

Most of Amane's route coincides with the main plot, and you probably won't have
to try to get hers unlocked.

 - When making dialogue choices, just make sure you're at least open-minded to
   the idea of God and whatnot. Don't ridicule Him/Amane, don't doubt
   everything they say, etc. Being gung-ho about becoming the Messiah and/or
   God will also work (though you might shut off, say, Naoya's route).

 1. Throughout the game, several blue events that don't take up time appear,
    once per day for the middle stretch of the game or so. Some of these
    contribute to being able to get her route.
 2. On the 4th day, save Haru at 17:00 by choosing her event. Good idea to have
    Yuzu remind you what time it is (she'll offer to do so at the beginning of
    the day).
 3. Contrary to what some people fear, in the 6th Day battle where you choose
    to help the angels, the demons, or kill both, choosing to kill the angels
    will not ruin your chances of getting this route.
 4. If, on the 6th Day, you get an event with Amane wherein Remiel speaks
    through her and Strongly Advocates your becoming the Messiah and getting
    everyone to obey God's teachings through your proselytizing, etc etc,
    you've secured Amane's route.

{// B: Atsuro ...........................
                                  .................................. [2903] //}

One of the possible 5th Day deaths does affect Atsuro's route. Only on Atsuro's
route do you get information about the EMT field (aka what the government's
final option is that'll kill everyone on the Last Day).

 - With your dialogue choices, agree with Atsuro whenever possible, and also
   agree with the idea that keeping demons around could help society.

 1. There are three Atsuro events on the 3rd and 4th Days which should let
    you find his friend 10Bit and have Atsuro look into the COMP he leaves
    behind for info on the EMT field.
 2. On the 4th day, save Haru at 17:00 by choosing her event. Good idea to have
    Yuzu remind you what time it is (she'll offer to do so at the beginning of
    the day).
    *** NOTE: I've heard that you don't actually need to save Haru for Atsuro's
        route. If I can get a bit more information (i.e. is there any change in
        the Bel fights, etc) and more confirmation, I'll take this part out.
 3. Keisuke can't die. So on Day 4, make sure you get Mari's bag, and give
    it to Kaido. Then fight Mari's battle at 12:00, and Keisuke's at 13:00. If
    you don't give the bag to Kaido, you'll have to choose between Mari's and
    Keisuke's battles, essentially killing Mari, so there you go.
 4. On the 6th Day, you'll get one last scene with Atsuro where he talks about
    the possibility of controlling all the demons. Pick it and agree with him
    to secure his route.

There are a few critical points you have to get through if you want Gin/Haru's
route.

 - with your dialogue choices, just keep open-minded and don't swing too much
   towards, say, being the Messiah or the overlord. Agree with Gin when he says
   he'd like Tokyo to go back to the way it was.

 1. On the 4th day (provided you've been following Gin's events), there'll be
    an event with him at Shiba Park. Eventually you'll come across two choices
    in the dialogue when he talks about Aya's disappearance: "Want me to help?"
    and "Don't give up." Pick the FIRST one. Or else - you guessed it - the
    route's sealed off, as you won't be able to investigate her disappearance
    and trigger a key battle on Day 6.
 2. On the 4th day, save Haru at 17:00 by choosing her event. Good idea to have
    Yuzu remind you what time it is (she'll offer to do so at the beginning of
    the day).
 3. Fight the battle against Azuma on the 6th day, and keep Gin alive. Then
    view one more scene with him, and the scene with Gin and Amane. When Gin
    says he'll help you look for Haru and talks about getting rid of all the
    demons, tell him you agree and will help, and you've secured his route.

The first one could take you by surprise. I kept wondering why I hadn't
unlocked his route on my first playthrough, only to discover that -that- was
the reason. Needless to say, wasn't impressed.

Emails:

5th Day
 - Okay.
(If you previously chose "Tell me about Haru")
 - Tell me about Aya. <-- +
(If you previously chose "Tell me about you")
 - Tell me about Haru. <-- +

   NOTE: It doesn't matter what you chose on the 4th Day for your reply,
         honestly. Not sure where the misconception came from. Essentially
         asking him about himself or Aya gets the same info, so as long as
         you don't pick "Okay" on the 5th day, you're fine.


{// D: Kaido ............................
                                  .................................. [2905] //}

Neither of the 5th Day possible deaths have any effect on getting Kaido's
route. This route essentially takes the same path as Naoya's and doesn't unlock
you Kaido's pic on the title screen (it unlocks Naoya's, actually), but it's a
route nonetheless. Kaido doesn't harp on the Bels and wants power instead,
though.

If you've unlocked both Kaido's and Naoya's routes, and you choose one of them
and then decide you need more time to make up your mind, the one you didn't
select will disappear from the map.

 1. Make sure you find out about Kaido's brother and situation in early events,
    etc etc.
 2. On the 4th day, save Haru at 17:00 by choosing her event. Good idea to have
    Yuzu remind you what time it is (she'll offer to do so at the beginning of
    the day).
 3. If you get the option to BS the fight with Keisuke, don't. If you do,
    you'll have to fight Kaido and Midori in the future, and you'll end up
    destroying his COMP.
 4. No matter how the events of the 5th Day went, talk to Kaido. The dialogue
    will change depending, but he'll ask you if you want to team up with him
    and get your hands on all the COMPs, putting all the power in your hands.
    On the 6th Day, agree to help him find the COMP factory, find it (blue
    event), and pick Kaido's last event. You must choose to tell him where the
    factory is. This will secure Kaido's route.

                                  .................................. [2906] //}

Naoya doesn't seem to be a particularly picky guy. Most of his route's stuff
coincides with the main plot, and he's pretty keen on you becoming the King
no matter how reluctant you might sound.

If you've unlocked both Kaido's and Naoya's routes, and you choose one of them
and then decide you need more time to make up your mind, the one you didn't
select will disappear from the map.

 - With your dialogue choices, as long as you aren't insanely enthusiastic
   about being a Messiah, you should be fine, even if you doubt Naoya a little
   (if you go for power and overlord-ism-ness too much, you'll probably block
   off other routes).

 1. There are several blue events that don't use up time. You get one per day
    for three or so days, and some of these contribute to getting Naoya's
    route.
 2. On the 4th day, save Haru at 17:00 by choosing her event. Good idea to have
    Yuzu remind you what time it is (she'll offer to do so at the beginning of
    the day).
 3. On the 5th Day, there'll be a mandatory battle where Naoya summons seven
    demons and stands as an outside party on the field. It's not in the mission
    requirements, but he wants you to defeat six of them in three turns or less
    if you want to get info from him. Despite the hype about having to beat
    them in one turn, two's honestly enough and easily doable even on your
    first playthrough. Either one's "passing" to him.
 4. On the 6th Day, there should be an event with Naoya where he says he'd
    really, really like you to become the King of Bel. Pick it and you've
    secured Naoya's route.

There's actually nothing really to say for Yuzu's route, as hers is the default
one that'll appear no matter where you swerve in the game. She has a few
events, but they're not mandatory. Just some extra character story stuff. I'm
not sure if you can even get it so that her route is the only one that appears
as an option at the end...but if that happened, dunno what you were doing
timeskipping so often and chickening out on all the questions.

 1. If you didn't save Haru on the 4th Day at 17:00, this'll be the only route
    you can get.

=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=

Didn't take a certain route but you want to know what happened? Look no
further. Well...if I got to that route yet, at least. Note that when I
"summarize," I fall just a little under what'd be pure transcription...yeah.
So. There's your fair warning.

I'm also trying to keep as objective a voice as possible, but in some of them
my more...wry comments will probably pepper the whole thing (re: Amane's). Hey,
I try.


{// A: Amane ............................
                                  .................................. [3002] //}

So, you decide to become the Messiah. Cue fanfare. Remiel blames demons for
corrupting man; though, if mankind was strong, it wouldn't be a problem...but
the angels don't wish that much from mankind. Angels and demons have fought
forever, but with the Throne of Bel, you can subdue the demons. He leaves.
Midori says what he said sounded a lot like what Keisuke said...is this the
right decision?

Remiel will now lead you all as His messenger. Plus, you don't have to worry
about the deadline any more, and you can trust his word as the angels won't
deceive you. Anyway, your task is to defeat all the Bels, starting with
Jezebel, who's within Amane. Remiel says you've begun to awaken as Abel, which
will help you.

For this fight, you'll be going into Amane's mind. First, Remiel tells you
about Abel, His beloved child. You're capable of becoming the Messiah and the
overlord, yet you're no one special. Remiel says this is true. There once were
two brothers, Cain and Abel. This was the first human tragedy, as Abel, the
child of sorrow, was the first human killed by his fellow man – his own
brother. Abel, killed before awakening as His child, continues to be
reincarnated as a human, and his essence has been inherited by many.
Essentially, one Cain, but many Abels. So someone like you isn't rare. But,
you've defeated two Bels, and Abel's dormant power has begun to awaken within
you, which was what allowed you to absord the Bels' power in the first place.

But anyway, with the COMP to direct the flow of thoughts, you'll enter Amane's
soul and fight Jezebel. If you die there, it's like dying in the real world.
It's also possible that Amane's soul will oppose you, considering how much
control Jezebel has right now.

You get warped into a "Cartesian Garden." A...beautiful field of flowers and a
crystal clear pond and so on. (We get the symbolism, really.)  You spot Amane,
but a voice asks, "Who dares to track mud through another's soul?" Oops, looks
like it's Jezebel. Suddenly everything goes dark, and the once-utopian garden
has now become red flaming rock and a lava pond. Charming. Jezebel appears.

After you defeat her, you return to the real world. Atsuro asks Remiel what's
next, and Amane laughs, saying, "Can't you tell? It's me, Amane." Apparently
after Jezebel's defeat, Remiel's now gone. But Amane can still hear his voice
and tell you what to do. She says that yes, they'll be going against the
Shomonkai's teachings, but in speaking with Remiel, she came to know God's love
and kindness. The Shomonkai's way causes suffering and uses demonic power,
which she can't accept, even if it'll put her at odds with her father.

Remiel says your ultimate objective is the King's Gate, or Babel. As the King
of Bel, you'll lead mankind to peace as God's messenger. The summoning server
is none other than Babel itself, which Belberith has moved to the demon world.
However, you'll need to manifest Babel in your world.

The demon world and human world are adjacent to each other, and only a wall of
power stands between them. Tokyo has been protected by the Four Devas until
now, and they maintain this wall of power and kept demons from entering before.
For the Shomonkai to have used COMPs in Tokyo, Amane defeated one of the Devas
with Jezebel – Jikoku. At that time, she thought her father's teachings were
the only way to save the world.

Even if you become qualified right now, you can't summon Babel into this world.
So...you'll have to defeat the remaining Devas, too. Keisuke chimes in, asking
if it's dangerous to defeat the Devas, since demons could just pour into Tokyo.
Amane says so many demons have been summoned that it'll be only days before
this imbalance crushes the human world. Basically, you don't have a choice.

You're off to Eikokuji, a temple near Ikebukuro. Amane also joins your party.

Atsuro says if only he knew this would happen, he'd have paid more attention
on school trips about these Devas. The group talks about the Devas and Japanese
history for a bit more, and then you run into Bishamon. He tells you to show
his power, as he'll let no weakling pass. After that, it's up to you.

After you defeat Bishamon, some sort of dark purple spiral appears in the sky.
"Tokyo's corruption begins in earnest," Amane says. The next Deva's to the
south in Sengakuji, in Shinagawa.

The team has an ominous feeling (hint, hint). And yeah – in the next fight, you
get to fight both remaining Devas, Zouchou and Koumoku, at the same time.
Atsuro says if the worlds don't connect now, they're going to regret this
forever. But after you defeat them, the sky resembles molten lava, and there's
a hole in it. The portal has been opened. If you wait too long, the demon world
will swallow yours, so you need to hurry. The aperture to the demon world is on
the top floor of the Hills building, where the Shomonkai's server room is.

Once you get to the building, a humongous fly – Belzaboul – stands in your way.
Amane says his power might even rival Belberith's. He says he'll take your
power as an offering to Belberith. When asked why, when he's a Bel himself, he
says that unfortunately it's not his master's wish, and Belzaboul's mission is
to get Belberith to the throne.

After you win, Yuzu wonders why the Shomonkai came to worship Belberith in the
first place. Amane says her father foresaw the coming of God's ordeal while he
was a student in theological school, and then tells the story of the Tower of
Babel: long ago, humans tried to build a tall tower that would reach the
heavens. But this was in defiance of God, who soon showed his wrath. The old
common language was divided, preventing humans from communicating. But
technology allowed humans to overcome this, who are now "more than capable of
repeating such blasphemies." At that time, one king led all the people. If he
did evil, the rest of humanity would as well without even knowing it.

The act of delivering an individual will was once only available to kings, but
in today's day and age, anyone can do so. The reverse is also true – people can
get any information, even fake or malicious info. And knowledge of things such
as bomb-making, stealing, killing... Amane says that not all humans can
determine right from wrong, and as more people become involved in virtual
lives, they become more secluded and run towards comforting lies. If mankind
continues like this, God will surely judge for us, but mankind might not be
strong enough to withstand the ordeal. The Shomonkai founder grew afraid of
this, and wanted to do something about it.

So, he turned to Belberith, the largest of the demons that inherited Bel's
power. It really wants revenge against God, hence its role in the war.

In the meantime, up the building you go. Yuzu remembers the elevators don't
work right now and freaks out. Midori cheers her on, and Keisuke comments that
53 floors must feel practically infinite if you're on foot. Everyone else in
your party says a little "We're going to make it, MC!" type of thing.

...And then the stairs kill everyone, the end. (Kidding.)

You get to the top of the Hills and emerge in a strange room with a pipe organ,
glowing green light, and various hi-tech-ish objects. The Founder stands before
you and tells Amane, "You fool... Know your place! You are a maiden of the
Shomonkai!" He can't believe she's betrayed them and has lost all hope in her.
Amane tells him about Remiel, says that destroying God isn't the only way to
overcome this ordeal, and that the Shomonkai brought the ordeal upon them. Was
this what they hoped for? The founder says there's nothing left to say.

He then asks Belberith to descend to this world by consuming his flesh and
soul, with his only condition being that he then defeats God and brings about a
world free of His ordeals. Belberith agrees, and a huge, purple mass appears on
the altar. Amane doesn't believe what happened to her father. Belberith laughs
at how the founder thought he was giving him power, and says he's starting a
new world order.

After you defeat the last Bel, Amane mourns her father. Atsuro says that even
though his methods were wrong, he only wanted to save people and wasn't bad.
Yuzu says Belberith took advantage of him and it's always the humans getting
hurt, that the angels and demons aren't fair. Amane gathers up her resolve, and
tells you to summon Babel by awakening the power of Bel inside you.

Right when you're about to do so, Naoya appears. You disappoint him; he'd never
have guessed you'd end up serving God. He calls you brother, which confuses
Atsuro. He's always wondered, who exactly is Naoya? Naoya laughs, saying you're
his younger brother from a long time ago. He says you guys get a game over.
Atsuro tells him to try. Naoya mocks him, and Atsuro says that though Naoya got
you all into this, you're not his pawns.

Naoya asks if you remember: ages ago, he cultivated the Earth, and you tended
sheep... "Thinking back, that was the start of the favoritism. If our places
were switched..." After a turn, the flashy gigolo guy appears, observes how you
brothers are fighting, and asks if he can join in. Naoya tersely calls him
Loki, and he joins in the battle.

Naoya says he thought about it, and God wanted someone to blindly follow him,
who was you. If that was it, he wouldn't have killed you. "As the Earth tender,
I offered God my finest crops. But what god wanted was blood! Blood does not
run in crops! God asked the impossible of me, knowing I was a farmer!" So he
killed you, pierced your heart, and offered Him blood. Naoya then says that
you, Abel, hate him, don't you, and that you want to kill him. Otherwise, you
never could have earned the right to become King. If you tell him you don't
hate him, he says he won't acknowledge it; either way he won't let you return
to God.

After you win, Naoya says the punishment God forced upon him will have you meet
again. One day, he'll get his revenge. With that, he disappears. You realize
Naoya must have been Cain. When Abel was killed, his essence was widely
inherited as seeds for the future, but Cain's punishment was to be forever
reincarnated while bearing that sin – accumulating memories forever. Atsuro
says no wonder Naoya could predict people so well – he lived so many lifetimes.
But supposedly, it's to give Cain time to gain awareness of what he's done.
Cain claims God doesn't love him and thus killed Abel, but that can't be true,
otherwise God wouldn't have given him this time to reflect. And the
accumulation of memories is God's love. Supposedly. But unfortunately, Cain
used the time to plan revenge, as he sought to have Abel lead demons against
God.

As for Loki, he's a trickster god of Norse mythology. As a half-god,
half-giant, he'd deceive or help whoever he pleased. You can now fuse him in
the Cathedral of Shadows. But anyway, back to the summoning. All of your party
members each say one more line of encouragement or camaraderie.

The MC glows, and suddenly a huge, golden tower shoots down from the sky and
crashes into the Hills building. A large gray head of a young woman with short
hair appears. And after you defeat the first Babel form, all the Bels reappear.
Then comes the final form of Babel.

After you get through that, the tower of Babel crashes down. According to
Amane, Remiel says the lockdown will be lifted and peace returned. And, as
Atsuro points out, you're now an overlord...er, Messiah. Yuzu says you're not
human any more, but apologizes and says she had no right to say that. Both of
them comment on your strength and how they never could have borne such a
burden. And now a world of order without chaos will begin.

There's an announcement about the lockdown ending. Kaido says it looks like
it's back to dullsville. Haru says you guys really did it. As does Izuna, who
says frankly that no mission has ever been this painful for her. Fushimi says
that after these seven days of panic and confinement, they have to handle this
carefully; their job's just begun. Izuna says it doesn't involve demons, so
sign her up as his first volunteer.

[Soon afterward, the Tokyo lockdown that lasted seven days was finally lifted.

Though only a few knew the truth, people could sense that the malicious
presences had disappeared. Those who survived were grateful to be alive, and
mourned for those were less fortunate. A new form of order came over this world
that had regained peace.

The young new King of Bel, who held the power of demons, was urged to use that
power as God's advocate: to be the absolute judge of man's sins. Thus would man
always live with the fear of God and live pure lives at all times.

A new age of law had come to the world.]

(The above is said over an image of the MC in a spiffy (perhaps?) white cape-
robe-garment, Amane, Yuzu, and Atsuro. Yeah, can't quite get over the cape, for
better or worse.)

{// B: Atsuro ...........................
                                  .................................. [3003] //}

Atsuro wants you to hear him out. He says that there's definitely a way to
control all the demons through the server, and if you choose not to annihilate
them and keep them around, it could help mankind. Access to them would be
restricted to special government organizations, but he likens it with nuclear
energy in the hands of the government – it allows the citizenry to benefit,
without the danger, if done properly. He says that this would require
significant reprogramming of the server, which he can't do on his own...you'll
have to find Naoya and convince him to join you. If you fulfilled the
requirements, Mari will also join you.

The next day, you'll find Naoya, who's also looking for you. He says the
deadline's been moved up to 13:00 and it's now or never for you to become the
King of Bel. You tell him that you want to go through with Atsuro's plan.
Naoya that if you become the King, you'll be able to control the demons. Atsuro
says that's not the same thing, as it'd be power in the hands of one person.
Right or wrong, a dictator's a dictator. Naoya says its meaningless, pointing
to what he calls their corrupt country as an example. He says he'll tell you
where the server is, but Atsuro says you need his help as well. He laughs,
saying this dependency makes your plan flawed, but you tell him he's no
different, needing you. He says his situation's quite different, but decides to
play a game with you: defeat him, and he'll help.

After the battle, Naoya looks absolutely livid, and can't believe you've gotten
so strong, saying that must be the power of Bel. But a promise is a promise,
and he'll help you change the server's programming. After all, he'll just have
to wait 1000 years for what he wants, he says...he just wanted to see your
power and potential for himself. Sariel shows up (via a possessed human) to
keep an eye on Naoya. Naoya says he'll be at his apartment in Aoyama, with a
backup generator and the files he needs, and tells you to find him in a few
hours.

Atsuro says you need to get the deadline pushed back, so you're off to find
Izuna and Fushimi. Atsuro tells them your plan, saying that if you can control
all the demons by 13:00, they should stop the final option. You also tell them
you have the angels' approval...and you want more time. Fushimi asks what kind
of a limb you're pushing him out on, but says he'll try. Atsuro says that when
you succeed, you'll send all the demons back to their world, and that'll be the
sign that it worked. Fushimi then tells Izuna to join your party and help.

Off to ask Remiel where the server is. He confirms that the server's becoming
Babel, and says it's because Belberith took the server to the demon world in
order to "use it as a medium for Babel" – he wants the power, and since Babel
can't be seen or touched, this was the only way to interact with it. But, since
Belberith's still fighting over the throne of Bel, it means he can't be King
quite yet. So, you'll have to make yourself qualified before Belberith does so.
You won't have to go into the demon world; Babel is the King's Gate, and the
final trial, so it'll show itself once you're qualified. As Remiel says,
"Connect the two worlds by eliminating the power that divides them." (Which
he'll explain later.) Then you can open a portal through which you'll summon
Babel.

You'll have to gain power from the other Bels, through either ritual or combat.
Jezebel no longer resides in Amane, however, and her presence seems to have
vanished from this world. Whether she was afraid of you and ran, or whether she
was defeated by a Bel, Remiel doesn't know. But he thinks Belberith killed her,
because he'd rather have her power than let you get it. And if he becomes
qualified, Babel will be summoned into the demon world where you can't go.

The demon world and human world are adjacent to each other, and only a wall of
power stands between them. Tokyo has been protected by the Four Devas until
now, and they maintain this wall of power and kept demons from entering before.
For the Shomonkai to have used COMPs in Tokyo, they had to have defeated one of
the Devas – Jikoku. Remiel says though Amane was distressed by it, she had her
reasons for helping in its defeat. Atsuro says this part with the Devas makes
more sense, as if the demon summoning program just recreated rituals, normal
rituals to summon also should've worked.

Remiel also adds that even if you become qualified right now, you can't summon
Babel into this world. So...you'll have to defeat the remaining Devas, too.
Midori chimes in, asking if it's dangerous to defeat the Devas, since demons
could just pour into Tokyo. Remiel says this is true, and what awaits humans
then is certain destruction. But so many demons have been summoned that it'll
be only days before this imbalance crushes the human world. Basically, you
don't have a choice.

Remiel says one Deva is to the north, the fiercest one, at a temple near
Ikebukuro. Atsuro exclaims that going for the strongest one first isn't the
normal order of things. But Eikokuji it is, and on you go.

Atsuro says if only he knew this would happen, he'd have paid more attention
on school trips about these Devas. The group talks about the Devas and Japanese
history for a bit more, and then you run into Bishamon. He tells you to show
his power, as he'll let no weakling pass. After that, it's up to you.

After you defeat Bishamon, some sort of dark purple spiral appears in the sky.
Your group knows this was due to his defeat. Remiel appears, saying good job
and that the next Deva's to the south in another temple, in Shinagawa. Yuzu
thinks it's Sengakuji. Remiel warns you not to be hasty and to prepare.

The team has an ominous feeling (hint, hint). And yeah – in the next fight, you
get to fight both remaining Devas, Zouchou and Koumoku, at the same time. When
you defeat them, the sky resembles molten lava, and there's a hole in it. The
portal has been opened.

Your group heads over to Naoya's to see how things are going. The Shomonkai are
guarding it, like Remiel said. Naoya says you're stronger than he thought if
you progressed this quickly already. When you ask about the program, he says
not to rush things, as you still have to defeat the Bels. He tells you
Belberith is at the top of the Hills building, which is also where you can
summon Babel. That's also where the Shomonkai lab is, and where the server
used to be.

Pretty much, Naoya needs a little more time, as he has to revamp the interface
and security. Atsuro groans, saying he completely forgot about how hackers
would want to crack a system like this. Naoya sighs and says he really is
dense. Atsuro's about to ask something else, but Naoya says that if Atsuro's
his right-hand apprentice, he should just do what needs doing himself. Being
called that fires Atsuro up.

Naoya says this will give mankind great power, but again, great power and great
risks go hand in hand. He'll wait to see if mankind can really use it to the
fullest, and laughs.

Once you get to the building, a humongous fly – Belzaboul – stands in your way.
He says he'll take your power as an offering to Belberith. When asked why, when
he's a Bel himself, he says that unfortunately it's not his master's wish, and
Belzaboul's mission is to get Belberith to the throne.

After you win, Yuzu wonders why the Shomonkai came to worship Belberith in the
first place. Fushimi appears, saying their dossiers might help. But first, he
says that the government decided to give them an hour's grace before the final
option, and if the plan works, the final option will be canceled.

Fushimi then tells the story of the Tower of Babel: long ago, humans tried to
build a tall tower that would reach the heavens. But this was in defiance of
God, who soon showed his wrath. The old common language was divided, preventing
humans from communicating. The Shomonkai founder believed that tragedy would
happen again soon, and wanted to do something about it. The first demon that he
managed to summon was Belberith, the largest of the demons that inherited Bel's
power. It really wants revenge against God, hence its role in the war.

In the meantime, up the building you go. Yuzu remembers the elevators don't
work right now and freaks out. Midori cheers her on, and Keisuke comments that
53 floors must feel practically infinite if you're on foot.

There's no turning  back at this point; it's the tower or bust. Atsuro wonders
if Naoya'll make it, but Fushimi shows up and tells you to go ahead and says
he'll tell Naoya where you are. Atsuro starts to doubt whether he can hack the
server or not, but reminds himself that he's Naoya's apprentice, and that he
has to. Everyone else in your party says a little "We're going to make it, MC!"
type of thing.

...And then the stairs kill everyone, the end. (Kidding.)

You get to the top of the Hills and emerge in a strange room with a pipe organ,
glowing green light, and various hi-tech-ish objects. The Founder stands before
you, and says it was disgraceful to allow you to get so far. He asks why you've
come here, and scoffs at whatever you say, reaffirming his ideals and how he
believes this is the only way to save mankind from God and create an age of
reform. He then asks Belberith to descend to this world by consuming his flesh
and soul, with his only condition being that he then defeats God and brings
about a world free of His ordeals. Belberith agrees, and a huge, purple mass
appears on the altar. The other Believers hesitantly cheer his presence.

After you defeat the last Bel, Naoya appears. You're going to summon Babel now.
All of your party members say one more line of encouragement or camaraderie.

The MC glows, and suddenly a huge, golden tower shoots down from the sky and
crashes into the Hills building. Naoya says that if you have a change of heart,
now's the last time. Yuzu tells him you're not going to be King, so leave it
be; Naoya says he was joking. He heads off to the center console to hack the
server, and tells you to cover him. Atsuro excitedly asks him what he can do;
Naoya tells him to put a lid on it, and then to go to the sub-console.

After a bit of fighting, the security system – Babel – appears in the form of a
big gray head. Defeat it, defeat its true form, and you're done. Naoya tells
Atsuro to key in the command telling all demons to return to their world.

Cut to a new scene – Fushimi's trying to protect a citizen from rogue demons,
to no avail, when suddenly they all disappear in little clouds of (what I guess
are) data packets.

The tower of Babel crashes down. Naoya's rewritten the program, so demons are
directly controlled without contracts. They have no say in the matter, and
their power's now yours. Yuzu asks if it's over, and Naoya says in regards to
the result you were aiming for, yes. He tells you that though you won an
important victory today, don't forget that even before the demons, the world
was "no paradise." It's all up to humans now. You can tell him you believe in
humanity, yourself, or the future; either way, it's just the kind of answer he
expects.

Fushimi radioes in to his superiors, who reply that they're lifting the
lockdown. Shoji observes the demons disappearing and says you kids really did
it. Kaido says he's not imagining things, and that it's over. Remiel, via
Amane, says that you've overcome this ordeal, but don't forget that if man
loses his way again, there'll yet be more ordeals. He says, "I...want to
believe in man," and prays for a peaceful future, for mankind, not just for
order. Gin says it's over, and also says Aya's name. The flashy gigolo guy
chuckles at how you chose to use technology instead of becoming king, and says
he never tires of seeing "what they'll come up with next." But still, with
great power comes temptation, so he'll look forward to seeing what you do in
the next few years.

[And so, Babel and the demons came under man's control.

Few knew the truth, but the disappearance of the demons led to an unspoken
understanding that the situation had come to a close.

That evening, the Tokyo lockdown that lasted seven days was finally lifted.
Those who survived were grateful to be alive, and eventually they turned to
moruning the victims. The government announced that the incident was a mass
hallucination caused by gas leaks. Those who claimed to have seen demons were
unable to prove it.

The program had been rewritten, and COMPs could no longer summon demons. With
technology harnessing demons' power, the world headed toward a third revolution
on par with the industrial and informational revolutions.

This drastic change in the balance of power caused a shift in Japan's fortunes.
The military use of demons pushed Japan to an international role as a permanent
UN Security Council member. Military might secured their status as an equal
world power... This was the new Japan.]

Cutscene - Yuzu, Atsuro, and you, with a COMP in hand:

[Some time after the incident, when your memories of it have begun to fade, you
receive an email on your no-longer-functional COMP...]

From M:

   "Son of man... Rather than become King of Bel, you took dominion over
    the demons with the skill and knowledge you gained. I have witnessed
    it with my own eyes. However, if you are consumed with the power of
    evil and succmb to desire, pandemonium will be again released...and
    this world will feel His wrath once more.

    I will be watching you, that order rules over man's future..."

{// C: Gin ..............................
                                  .................................. [3004] //}

Gin tells you he wants to erase all demons from Tokyo and restore the city to
what it was, and asks you to lend him strength. He then joins your party and
begins to go over tomorrow’s plans – "If a song we need can be created, the
maiden will show us how to reach the server." Basically, you’ll need to find
Haru and Amane. Mari will join the party if you fulfilled the requirements.

Gin reminds you that the deadline’s at 18:00. You suggest going to Bugeikan to
find Haru. Black Frost also joins your party. Atsuro says it’s kinda weird that
a demon’s coming along to help get rid of demons, but...

You find Haru. She says Gin’s up early for a night owl; he replies, funny what
a demon invasion will do for your sleep pattern. She says she needs a few more
hours, but the song’ll be done. Izuna finds you and says the deadline’s been
cut to 13:00 because all the blockades are under heavy attack. She’s trying to
negotiate for more time, and wishes you luck. Yuzu wonders how you’re going to
do this; Haru says she’ll keep plugging away at the song. Gin chuckles, and
says Haru seems like a different girl than who she was yesterday.

You find Amane – or Remiel, rather. Gin tells him that the song will be ready
before the deadline. Remiel says angels don’t lie, and that he will tell you
how to get to the server, as promised. Gin mentions the new deadline, which
Remiel says he’s aware of. First, you have to meet a number of conditions and
processes before you can access the server. You need to defeat the remaining
Bels to become King. The final trial in the fight for the throne is against
Babel, formed from the amount of energy lost by the original Bel – which is
the summoning server itself.

Atsuro asks in shock, "The Tower of Babel? From the Book of Genesis?" Remiel
affirms it, and says only the King can summon and awaken Babel. It was once in
this world, but Belberith tricked the Shomonkai into moving it to the demon
world, to use the server as a medium through which to manifest Babel. The
server harnesses the flow of thoughts, and the user can bend it to his will –
making it good for the task of controlling Babel. However, Belberith’s still
fighting for the throne, proving that he’s not yet worthy of becoming King. The
final objective in the war is to gain the power sleeping in Babel. So, you’ll
have to defeat all the Bels to get that. Speaking of which, there’s one pretty
close to you...Jezebel, in Amane. Yuzu says as Remiel’s also in her body,
wouldn’t it be easier for him to defeat Jezebel instead? Remiel answers that he
lends you strength because you attempt to withstand the ordeal with your own
strength. Jezebel’s slowly taking over Amane’s soul, and Remiel can’t hold it
off much longer.

But anyway, with the COMP to direct the flow of thoughts, you'll enter Amane's
soul and fight Jezebel. If you die there, it's like dying in the real world.
It's also possible that Amane's soul will oppose you, considering how much
control Jezebel has right now.

You get warped into a "Cartesian Garden." A...beautiful field of flowers and a
crystal clear pond and so on. (We get the symbolism, really.)  You spot Amane,
but a voice asks, "Who dares to track mud through another's soul?" Oops, looks
like it's Jezebel. Suddenly everything goes dark, and the once-utopian garden
has now become red flaming rock and a lava pond. Charming. Jezebel appears.

After you win, you return to the real world. Amane thanks you. Gin asks how to
get to the server, and that if she doesn’t tell him soon, he’ll stop believing
them. Amane says that Remiel’s consciousness just left her body, but a promise
is a promise. As Belberith has the server, you’ll need to manifest Babel in
your world. The demon world and human world are adjacent to each other, and
only a wall of power stands between them, which you’ll need to remove. They
didn’t tell you until now because it’s a heavy gamble that puts the world in
danger.

You’ll have to defeat the Four Devas to corrupt Tokyo, though this began long
ago. The city has been protected by the Four Devas until now, and they
maintain this wall of power and kept demons from entering before. For the
Shomonkai to have used COMPs in Tokyo, Amane defeated one of the Devas with
Jezebel – Jikoku. At that time, she thought her father’s teachings were the
only way to save the world.

Even if you become qualified right now, you can’t summon Babel into this world.
So...you’ll have to defeat the remaining Devas, too. As Atsuro points out, a
"destroy the city in order to save it" sort of thing. If you fail, demons will
be able to cross between the worlds at will, which will lead to destruction.
Amane says that so many demons have been summoned that it’ll be only days
before this imbalance crushes the human world. Basically, you don’t have a
choice.

You’re off to Eikokuji, a temple near Ikebukuro. Amane also joins your party.

Atsuro says if only he knew this would happen, he’d have paid more attention on
school trips about these Devas. Gin says that’s a good attitude – he should
remember that after the lockdown’s over. The group talks about the Devas and
Japanese history for a bit more, and then you run into Bishamon. He tells you
to show his power, as he’ll let no weakling pass. After that, it’s up to you.

After you defeat Bishamon, some sort of dark purple spiral appears in the sky.
"Tokyo’s corruption begins in earnest," Amane says. The next Deva’s to the
south in Sengakuji, in Shinagawa.

The team has an ominous feeling (hint, hint). And yeah – in the next fight, you
get to fight both remaining Devas, Zouchou and Koumoku, at the same time. After
you defeat them, the sky resembles molten lava, and there’s a hole in it. The
portal has been opened.

Remiel says to delete all the demons, you’ll need the song of truth. If you
infuse Babel with it, it should return all demons to their world. In addition
to becoming King, you’ll also have to close Babel – the King’s Gate, otherwise
demons can just come through again. Gin asks how you’ll do that, and Amane says
she doesn’t know. It must be the angels’ will that humans search for the means
themselves. Atsuro says they do this every time you need them. Amane says
they’re forbidden from helping humans during an ordeal, but Remiel’s at least
given you information; you should be grateful.

Yuzu says the deadline’s fast approaching, and you should think about getting
some extra insurance. Off to find Izuna and Fushimi. After you tell them
everything, Fushimi decides to believe that you can get rid of all the demons,
and says he’ll send an order to the SDF to abor the final option. It should
confuse the higher-ups enough to buy some time. He’ll have to deal with the
consequences afterwards if you all make it, but he’s prepared, and just wishes
he could do more. Atsuro says it’s okay, as you can’t endanger everything
outside the lockdown. Fushimi says he thought youw ere just children before,
but he’s honored to know you. He then tells Izuna to join  your party.

Haru’s almost done with the song – the track Aya left behind is broken up, and
when it’s put together it’ll be fine, but the most important track’s missing.
The file won’t open, saying, "Data corrupt." Yuzu tells Atsuro to fix it, and
he says he doesn’t have a charged laptop or power source to work with. Haru
says Aya was a genius and that no one could possibly mimic what she did. Gin
says Aya told him that Haru would surely outshine her one day. Haru tells him
to spare her the comforting lies. Gin asks her why she thinks Aya quit being
D-Va’s vocalist; Haru says, well, she hurt her throat, and...

Gin says Aya told him not to tell, but it’s true – it was to make her sing.
Haru says it’s a lie, but Gin silences her, saying Aya left that song in her
hands, and if she can’t do it, who else can? He begs her, saying Aya’d have
wanted it this way. Haru calls him a softie, and says she won’t take
responsibility for what happens, but she’ll do it. Oddly, the track sounds like
the first song Haru ever wrote...she then has a realization. The chord
progression’s from what she wrote when Aya was teaching her. Gin remembers – it
was a year ago, and Aya was excited, saying she had a gift for songwriting, and
that if it was arranged well it’d be better than her own stuff. This is the
same song, just with that kind of arrangement. Haru says that Aya was
amazing...now that she knows what this is, she can remember the missing part.
Gin asks her about Aya, "Now do you believe it?" Haru cries a little, but says
that hell yeah, she can finish this. Gin says Aya’s alive inside her; she
doesn’t need to look for her any more, just play her own music. Haru says
enough with the speeches; she has work to do. She’ll catch up with you later.
Amane calls her Harusawa (her full name) and tells her you’ll be at the Hills;
she says to call her Haru – the lead singer of D-Va. Amane laughs, saying the
song’s in good hands.

Once you get to the building, a humongous fly – Belzaboul – stands in your way.
Amane says his power might even rival Belberith’s. He says he’ll take your
power as an offering to Belberith. When asked why, when he’s a Bel himself, he
says that unfortunately it’s not his master’s wish, and Belzaboul’s mission is
to get Belberith to the throne.

After you win, Belberith’s all that’s left. Amane notes that he, as well as her
father, will be determined to defeat you. She’s okay with fighting him, though,
as once Belberith’s defeated, she’s sure he’ll come to his senses. Yuzu wonders
why the Shomonkai came to worship Belberith in the first place. Amane says her
father foresaw the coming of God’s ordeal while he was a student in theological
school, and then tells the story of the Tower of Babel: long ago, humans tried
to build a tall tower that would reach the heavens. But this was in defiance of
God, who soon showed his wrath. The old common language was divided, preventing
humans from communicating. But technology allowed humans to overcome this, who
are now "more than capable of repeating such blasphemies." At that time, one
king led all the people. If he did evil, the rest of humanity would as well
without even knowing it.

The act of delivering an individual will was once only available to kings, but
in today’s day and age, anyone can do so. The reverse is also true – people can
get any information, even fake or malicious info. And knowledge of things such
as bomb-making, stealing, killing... Amane says that not all humans can
determine right from wrong, and as more people become involved in virtual
lives, they become more secluded and run towards comforting lies. If mankind
continues like this, God will surely judge for us, but mankind might not be
strong enough to withstand the ordeal. The Shomonkai founder grew afraid of
this, and wanted to do something about it.

So, he turned to Belberith, the largest of the demons that inherited Bel’s
power. It really wants revenge against God, hence its role in the war.

In the meantime, up the building you go. Yuzu remembers the elevators don’t
work right now and freaks out. Atsuro tells her getting mad at him won’t help.
Gin looks pensive, and Amane says she’s sure Haru will make it in time. Gin
says he knows that. If he doesn’t believe in her, who will?

Fushimi appears. He gave the order and the operation’s in chaos, but it won’t
last for more than 90 minutes. You have until 14:30.

Once you go up, you can’t come back down. Gin worries about Haru. Atsuro says
you can’t wait any longer. Fushimi says he’ll tell her when she gets here to
head up. Gin says there could be demons around, and he can’t hold them off.
Fushimi says it’s true he doesn’t have the powers you do, but don’t
underestimate his desire to save the city. Gin laughs and says he’s another
idiot just like you guys; doesn’t he know heroes are out of fashion? He tells
him not to die. Fushimi wishes you good luck. Everyone else in your party says
a little "We’re going to make it, MC!" type of thing.

...And then the stairs kill everyone, the end. (Kidding.)

You get to the top of the Hills and emerge in a strange room with a pipe organ,
glowing green light, and various hi-tech-ish objects. The Founder stands before
you and tells Amane, "Know your place! You are a maiden of the Shomonkai!" He
can’t believe she’s betrayed them and has lost all hope in her. Amane tells him
about Remiel, says that destroying God isn’t the only way to overcome this
ordeal, and that the Shomonkai brought the ordeal upon them. Was this what they
hoped for? The founder says she’s hopelessly naive. Gin says he’s lost it.

He then asks Belberith to descend to this world by consuming his flesh and
soul, with his only condition being that he then defeats God and brings about a
world free of His ordeals. Belberith agrees, and a huge, purple mass appears
on the altar. Amane doesn’t believe what happened to her father. Belberith
laughs at how the founder thought he was giving him power, and says he’s
starting a new world order.

After you defeat the last Bel, Amane mourns her father. Atsuro says that even
though his methods were wrong, he only wanted to save people and wasn’t bad.
Yuzu says Belberith took advantage of him and it’s always the humans getting
hurt, that the angels and demons aren’t fair. Amane gathers up her resolve,
and tells you to summon Babel by awakening the power of Bel inside you.

After you defeat the last Bel, Haru appears. Though she didn’t see the battle,
she notices Amane’s mood, and asks her if she can keep going. She says Amane
still has life in her eyes, and tells her to keep her chin up. "Cry and scream
if you want to, but press on without regrets!" She also tells her to stop
calling her Harusawa. Gin says a woman’s emotions really are like a roller
coaster, and asks about the song. Haru says it’s done, but the sequencer’s
batteries are almost out. This’ll be a live run without practice. Gin says it
looks like she’s her normal self, and doesn’t have anything to worry about.

You’re going to summon Babel now. All of your party members each say one more
line of encouragement or camaraderie. Haru says she thinks Aya gave her work
because she knew what was going to happen. Gin says regardless of the truth,
he’s thankful for Aya – that he met her, and everything about her. After
everything’s all said and done, he wants Haru to sing. She asks if he has a
fever or something, since he’s always listened to her. Gin laughs, but says he
wants to hear her again.

The MC glows, and suddenly a huge, golden tower shoots down from the sky and
crashes into the Hills building. Atsuro says he thought it’d be more of a...
well, a gate, or something different at least. Yuzu says it’s like a tower, but
it’s huge. Haru comments on her great audience, and asks if she just has to
sing the song here. Amane says that’s what Remiel told her. If you close the
gate after the song’s uploaded, all the demons will leave and be unable to
return. Atsuro says he’ll take care of uploading it to Babel.

After a bit of fighting, the security system – Babel – appears in the form of a
big gray head – an old man with long hair. Defeat it, and you’re done. 

Fushimi’s trying to guard a civilian from a horde of demons, when they all
suddenly disappear. A soldier appears and says all the demons are disappearing
one by one. Fushimi puts down his gun, and says you made it in time.

Yuzu says all you have to do now is close the gate. Babel shakes and all of
your party members glow, and Haru says your COMP’s demons are going back too.
Black Frost appears, and says his journey ends here. He said he was happy
learning about love and that it was fun fighting alongside you. Midori
realizes that he’s going to disappear as well. Black Frost says he’ll never,
ever, ever forget you, and he’ll spread love around the demon realm. He thanks
you and disappears. Midori says someday, after he's taught demons about love,
they’ll be able to hang out again.

The tower starts shaking really badly. Yuzu says Babel’s acting funny. The
tower splits off, and rises back into the sky, before the gold paneling flies
off and it reveals its true form. It falls back down and splits open; that’s
why it’s called the King’s Gate. Haru leaves. You get to fight – without any
demons.

When you win, Babel asks you your wish. You tell it to go back to the demon
realm. It disappears, and you’re back on top of the Hills building. Your party
cheers. Haru’s exhausted. Gin worries, but she asks what’s up with his
expression; Aya’d be laughing at him. He says it was her best performance yet.
Your team leaders all say a little thing each.

Fushimi says the crisis is averted and lifts the lockdown. Shoji says the sky’s
back to the same foul blue, and that you guys really did it. Naoya says he
didn’t predict this – you discarded your own power and made both God and the
demons withdraw. "Thus does mankind prove its worth." But he says he won’t give
up, with a grin.

[And so, Babel was destroyed.

Though only a few knew the truth, people could sense that the malicious
presences had disappeared. That evening, the Tokyo lockdown that lasted seven
days was finally lifted. Those who survived were grateful to be alive, and
eventually they turned to mourning the victims.

The government announced that the incident was a mass hallucination caused by
gas leaks. Those who claimed to have seen demons were unable to prove it.

With the demon summoning server gone, the altered COMPs ceased to function.]

(The above is said above a series of background images of Tokyo. The next part
is said against an image of Yuzu, Atsuro, and you, in the afternoon sun.)

[And then... One day, some time after the incident, you receive an email on
your COMP, which should have already gone dark...]

From M:

   "Son of man,

    Your decision to relinquish the power of Bel is admirable... But that
    tremendous power still slumbers within you. Should you succumb to its
    temptation and use it for your own desire, we shall smite you down.

    Son of man, the fate of your world rests on whether you lose to your
    lesser nature. Forget it not."

(For the most part, see Naoya's route below. Basic differences are how the
route starts - Kaido wants to seize power so that he can protect things
important to him, and you're about to set off on your COMP factory takeover
plan when Naoya appears, telling you that there's an easier way: for you to
become the King of Bel.

 More detailed version to come.)



{// E: Naoya ............................
                                  .................................. [3006] //}

You see Naoya and Kaido discussing a plan. Naoya greets you and says he’s found
someone with talents, so he’s inviting Kaido along. Kaido learns you’re cousins
and says, no wonder you’re so weird. Naoya reminds you that if you become the
overlord you can lift the lockdown, and you’ll battle against God. If you
unlocked Kaido’s route, you ask him about his original plan, and he replies
that his crew’s taken hold of the COMP producing factory, but with this plan,
he doesn’t need them. He says that the lockdown’s God’s fault, and it’s pissing
him off. Naoya says once you become overlord, you can have anything you want...
well, money’ll be useless at that point, he laughs.

You can choose to think about it more, say you want Naoya to help Atsuro if you
unlocked his route, or go with Naoya’s route. When you do, Yuzu, Midori, and
Keisuke will say they can’t agree with what you’re doing and/or go with you,
and leave your party. Atsuro can’t believe it. Naoya says to leave them be, and
that anyone in this world can be replaced easily. You choose your own friends;
don’t waste time and energy fighting them.

Atsuro asks what Naoya’s trying to do and what he’ll gain from making you a
demon king. Naoya says isn’t Atsuro happy for you, as he’s giving you the gift
of power? At any rate, mankind will benefit; if a man rules over demonkind, the
demons will serve man and won’t harm him. Kaido asks if this will really stop
the government’s final option. Naoya says it’ll depend on negotiations, but who
would be foolish to say no to all the demons? If you ask Naoya what the risks
are, he says the only one is dealing with God; but, defeating him means mankind
will be free of His tyranny forever. Of course, Naoya will find a way and help
you. Atsuro asks if this’ll really work out by 18:00 tomorrow, and Naoya calls
him ever the worrier. He says it’ll be fine; he has some things to look into,
but he’ll be back by morning and you should rest; "The last curtain will rise,
and you will be the next overlord."

Kaido asks who Naoya is. Atsuro tells him he made the summoning system. Kaido
says his mind’s too sharp and he’s got a lot of secrets. Atsuro laughs, saying
everyone says that when they meet him for the first time. Kaido says he doesn’t
seem to be lying, though, so he doesn’t see a problem in working with him for
now. He also tells you that you need to figure out a speech, because declaring
war on the world should be epic.

In the morning, Atsuro wonders how Yuzu’s doing. Kaido calls you Mr. Overlord.
Naoya appears, saying he has a bit of bad news: the deadline’s been cut to
noon. Still, he says not to panic. Atsuro asks, once again, if your becoming
the overlord will save everyone. Naoya says who knows, and to ask you.

So, taking out the Bels. The first one lurks within a human...Jezebel, in
Amane’s mind. Meanwhile, Mari shows up, and says it’s her turn to let Kaido
lean on her. Black Frost also joins your party, if you fulfilled the
requirements.

Atsuro asks how Jezebel got inside Amane. Naoya said Belberith, whom the
Shomonkai worships, planted it in her via Amane’s innate abilities. You’ll have
to go into her mind – if you attacked her directly and Jezebel escaped, she’d
go back to Belberith and give him her power. If you capture Amane and hook her
mind up to a COMP, you’ll be able to attack, as the Demon Summoning Program
runs off thoughts and COMPs broadcast one’s thoughts to command demons. Atsuro
says Naoya designed the COMP to be able to do this from the start and asks how
far he could foresee the future.

Remiel’s inside Amane, and calls Naoya Cain, child of God. By God’s command,
Remiel’s come to "rend your standard in twain." Naoya laughs, calling them evil
angels...and Remiel can’t even use his full power in Amane’s body, anyway.

After you knock Amane unconscious, Naoya says you’ll have to take her somewhere
safe, as your bodies will be defenseless while you’re fighting Jezebel. Kaido
says there’s no such place in the lockdown; Naoya reminds him who made the
system and knows demons well, and says he prepared a place yesterday – a warded
portion of the Diet Building. Kaido says Naoya knows too much, and that the two
of them might have to go at it some day. Naoya says for his sake, he hopes not,
as he’s merciless when it comes to nuisances.

Atsuro asks if you can really fight inside a human soul. Naoya says he’s
overthinking this and that a soul isn’t as immense as you assume. Just like
reality, it’s based on a combination of external forces and inner thoughts.
Anyway, you’ll be fighting on Jezebel’s home turf, plus it might turn Amane
against you. Kaido doesn’t really get it, but asks if you’ll have to fight her.
Naoya says, in a way, as a free Amane would also oppose what you’re doing. But
be careful, because if her soul dies, Jezebel will have full control of her
body, so you can’t kill her.

You get warped into a "Cartesian Garden." A...beautiful field of flowers and a
crystal clear pond and so on. (We get the symbolism, really.)  Naoya says this
is the COMP’s visualization, and that you’ll have to be careful, as if the soul
senses death, the body will follow its lead, which means you’ll die for real.
You spot Amane, but a voice asks, "Who dares to track mud through another’s
soul?" Oops, looks like it’s Jezebel. Suddenly everything goes dark, and the
once-utopian garden has now become red flaming rock and a lava pond. Charming.
Jezebel also appears. Naoya reminds you that as he’s linked you up to Amane’s
soul, if he dies, you’ll be trapped.

After a while, Amane will regain consciousness. Jezebel then deploys several
Mind Amanes to attack her. Amane says she won’t let Jezebel have her way, and
asks Remiel to give her strength. Atsuro asks if she’s okay, and Amane says
you're the ones who weakened Remiel’s power and that you’re so frustrating.
Naoya ignores her and asks if she’d rather Jezebel consume her soul. If she
gets possessed you’ll die too, so you’ll all need to cooperate here. Amane
makes an angry face.

After you win, she says she’s grateful, but now you’re enemies. Naoya says it
sounds like fun. When Naoya asks, Naoya says to leave her be, otherwise the
Shomonkai won’t leave you alone. Atsuro speaks up, saying it’s about time Naoya
told you the truth about the whole thing. Naoya laughs, saying he thought
Atsuro’d feel that way eventually. Atsuro says he’s always like that, deciding
everything you do. Yuzu was worried about you guys, but you left her anyway to
follow him; you’re not his pawns. Wrong, Naoya says, as you’ve never been
anything but. Either way, your interests all align, but if you don’t trust him
it’s not enough, so he’ll explain.

You’ll have to defeat all the Bels and encounter Babel, a mass of energy lost
by the original Bel when God cast it into the demon world. The final objective
is to gain the power dormant within Babel, which is none other than the
summoning server. Right now, Belberith has it, and is using the server as a
medium to manifest Babel. Because it harnesses the flow of thoughts, it would
be best for this task.

So, you just have a few qualifications to meet. The demon world and human world
are adjacent to each other, and only a wall of power stands between them.
Destroy the wall, and create a place where Babel can be summoned. Tokyo has
been protected by the Four Devas until now, and they maintain this wall of
power and kept demons from entering before. For the Shomonkai to have used
COMPs in Tokyo, Amane defeated one of the Devas with Jezebel – Jikoku. 

You’ll have to defeat the remaining Devas, too. You wonder if it’s a good idea.
Naoya says what you’ve been doing is basically the same thing; there are only
days before this imbalance crushes the human world. Basically, you don’t have
a choice.

You’re off to Eikokuji, a temple near Ikebukuro. This is what Naoya was
researching the day before – the Devas.

The group talks about the Devas and Japanese history a little. Atsuro’s nervous
about it, but like it or not, the deadline’s 12:00. Bishamon appears. He tells
you they refuse to let the demon world appear, won’t hand you the city, and
tells you to kneel. If you acquiesce, Naoya tells you to basically stiffen your
backbone. If you say, "No, YOU," Naoya will say something along the lines of,
"What a pain. You should’ve stayed dead..."

After you defeat Bishamon, Atsuro says he still feels bad, since he was
protecting all of Tokyo. Kaido mocks him, saying Atsuro didn’t come along just
to save people. "You just want a reason to keep doin’ what you’re doin’. You
don’t want the responsibility." What’s wrong with wanting power, he says.
Atsuro says it’s not that easy. Naoya says the world will change, and don’t let
it leave you behind. Afterwards, some sort of dark purple spiral appears in the
sky. The city’s corruption has begun. Kaido feels practically giddy. The next
Deva’s to the south in Sengakuji, in Shinagawa. Naoya says to remain cautious,
especially since he can’t sense one of the Devas.

And yeah – in the next fight, you get to fight both remaining Devas, Zouchou
and Koumoku, at the same time. After you defeat them, the sky resembles molten
lava, and there’s a hole in it. The portal has been opened. The aperture to the
demon world is on the top floor of the Hills building, where the Shomonkai’s
server room is. There are also the two Bels, Babel, and even the angels to
face. Kaido says, so what, since you’ll eventually be going up against God
anyway. Atsuro says it’s not like he’s doubting them or anything, but...

Naoya decides to tell a story. God’s said to be an absolute being in various
religions and lore, complete in every way. But if he was truly absolute, His
creation would never falter. Yet humans do become corrupt, and demons do exist
– proof that He’s also flawed. And when His creations don’t obey His will, He
eliminates them. "He doesn’t save those who believe in Him. He crushes those
who don’t!" Angels are his messengers, little more than His wrath. Still, if
you also have to fight the angels...you might have to negotiate with the
government for more time. Kaido says you’d better think about what you’re going
 to say – you can’t just tell them you’re going to become overlord, but you
need time. Naoya says maybe it’s not a bad idea...

You find Fushimi and Izuna, and Naoya takes over. He says, surely they’ve found
out about him from their research on the Shomonkai. Fushimi says he’s always
wanted to talk to him, the guy who got everyone into this mess, face to face.
Naoya says not to get emotional; what’s he done, anyway? The Shomonkai summoned
the demons, and the government started the lockdown. Fushimi curses him; Naoya
says for someone to "muzzle this government lapdog," as he doesn’t have the
time. He tells them you’ll be the king of demons.

Fushimi says they’d never help you. Naoya says if he really wanted to save the
people of Tokyo, he’d help. After all, once you become overlord, you can order
demons to keep from attacking humans; fortunately, you’re kindhearted. Fushimi
finds it hard to believe.

Naoya asks if he trusts the angels, then, as they know this mission’s futile:
the final option can’t exterminate all the demons, plus you’ve already opened a
portal to the demon world. The world will end, and the angels won’t do
anything. You’re done preparing, but you need time. Fushimi says it’s not their
call, as there’s a commander outside. Naoya says it doesn’t matter how he gets
it done; think it over. Fushimi says he can’t make promises. Naoya says it’s
fine, just remember that everything in the world depends on him. You leave.

Kaido says Naoya had them eating out of his hand, there. Naoya says he just
told them the truth, a frank and honest negotiation. They put themselves in a
corner, such a gross "sin." He knows the deadline will now be extended. Atsuro
says he’d hate to have Naoya for an enemy, and asks if what he said about the
demons was true. Naoya says it wasn’t the whole truth, but he told no lies.
Doesn’t matter; the angels coerced the lockdown anyway. Everyone plays dirty.
Now that the government knows the angels aren’t on their side, there’ll be a
bunch of bureaucratic meetings and red tape, which will buy you time.

Once you get to the building, a humongous fly – Belzaboul – stands in your way.
Just as Naoya planned. He says he’ll take your power as an offering to
Belberith. When asked why, when he’s a Bel himself, he says that unfortunately
it’s not his master’s wish, and Belzaboul’s mission is to get Belberith to the
throne.

After you win, Naoya says Belzaboul used to be the Duke of Hell. Now that
you’ve defeated him, the power of Bel inside you should be stronger.
Belberith’s the Bel that the Founder summoned. Kaido says he’s just an ordinary
guy, so why did he lend him power? Naoya says that from what he knows, the
founder genuinely intended to save people, knowing that God’s ordeal was close
and man wouldn’t survive. Atsuro says it wouldn’t have happened if he hadn’t
caused the lockdown. Naoya says oh, it would have – that’s how God is. When you
ask, he switches the topic back to Belberith, the largest of the demons that
inherited Bel’s power. It really wants revenge against God, hence its role in
the war. He and the Founder were in accord.

Atsuro says he must be pretty strong by now, with all the Bels he’s absorbed.
But you have the powers of four Bels, and if you fight him in this world, he
won’t be at full strength. If you can’t win this way, then he simply can’t be
beaten.

Fushimi appears. He reached a settlement with the top brass, giving you two
more hours. If you settle it by then, they’ll lift the lockdown. He begs you to
save Tokyo, and wishes you luck.

Atsuro groans at the thought of taking the stairs. You reply, and he says
you’re sounding more and more like Naoya. Naoya asks, did Atsuro say anything?
Atsuro quickly replies no. Before you go, however, the angels Sariel and Anael
appear. They call your arrogance inconceivable and tell you to fall to the
blade of God. Naoya says it’s impressive they’ve shown up to fight you; must
be trouble in paradise. Sariel says other humans are incapable of stopping you
now, and asks if you’re willing to be God’s messenger – they’ll lift the
lockdown if you do.

Whatever you say, Naoya and the angels exchange words. The angels wonder why
you, Abel, choose to follow Naoya, asking if you’ve truly lost your soul’s
memory. Naoya gets angry and tells you not to listen. Anael calls you foolish,
saying Naoya once robbed you of your life. Atsuro says you’ve made your choice,
and you can’t turn back now.

Sariel once again pleads with you. Naoya mocks how he’s trying to work Bel’s
power into his selfish deal. Sariel calls him Cain, who despite being God’s
child, was the first murderer, and says he should die.

After you win, Kaido says that was a waste of time. Atsuro says now that you’ve
fought the angels, this is it. Naoya says that God’s world is ruled by absolute
order and justice, no exceptions. "But it’s difficult for a man to go from
cradle to grave without a single sin, hmm?" By God’s and the angels’ standards,
all humans will be judged without mercy. Atsuro says he knows and that he
doesn’t want a world like that, either. Naoya says there’s "no need to fear Him
or to kiss His ass...God’s irrelevant. We’re all we need." 

Atsuro says humans have been trying hard, so to hell with the lockdown. Kaido
says not to overthink it – you want power, the world, and that’s enough to
fight. But the angels had nerve to ask you to join them. Naoya says they crave
your potential power. If the overlord were to bow to God, His authority would
increase, and the demon world’s strength would decrease. Eventually demons
could never challenge God. If you ask about Abel, Naoya doesn’t answer.

In the meantime, up the building you go. Everyone else in your party says a
little "We’re going to make it, MC!" type of thing.

...And then the stairs kill everyone, the end. (Kidding.) Kaido grouses, asking
why the overlord and his minions have to taie the -stairs-. Naoya comments on
how modern society needs electricity and its conveniences. Atsuro says, "Were
we really that fragile?"

You get to the top of the Hills and emerge in a strange room with a pipe organ,
glowing green light, and various hi-tech-ish objects. Naoya says this floor was
rented and made unavailable to the public, for the summoning server’s setup.
The Founder appears, saying how dare Naoya show his traitorous face, and you
guys could never understand his glorious ideas. He won’t let you use the demons
to fulfill your desires. Atsuro says he’s doing the same thing, and the Founder
says he’s only had one desire – for people to overcome God’s ordeal.

He then asks Belberith to descend to this world by consuming his flesh and
soul, with his only condition being that he then defeats God and brings about a
world free of His ordeals. Belberith agrees, and a huge, purple mass appears on
the altar. The Shomonkai cheer his presence.

After you defeat Belberith, Atsuro asks if this was where Naoya accessed the
server before. He says yes, until Belberith moved it to the demon world...the
server’s properties are already changing inside Babel, but as long as the
server’s components are there, the network should be fine. Atsuro says when
things get that crazy, his brain can only imagine so much; Naoya says he needs
to study more.

But, time to summon Babel. Your party members all give a little spiel. The MC
glows, and suddenly a huge, golden tower shoots down from the sky and crashes
into the Hills building. A large gray head of a woman with long hair
appears. And after you defeat the first Babel form, all the Bels reappear. Then
comes the final form of Babel.

After you get through that, the tower of Babel crashes down. (And wow, that’s
the evilest face the MC’s had yet throughout the game.) Your party members all
say their thing. Atsuro says it’d have been better if Yuzu was here with you
guys. Naoya says you did well, [MC], then corrects himself and says Abel; just
as he expected. Now that you’re overlord, there are things you must do. Are you
ready...?

Atsuro asks about the lockdown. Naoya says it has no purpose now. "Demons
challenging angels has nothing to do with the fate of mankind." You’re going to
make those angels understand. Kaido says he gets it – the angels then won’t
deal with humans any more. And if they think you don’t care about their
welfare...well, that gets rid of one of your weak spots. Naoya laughs, and
says, let them confine and destroy COMP users to their hearts’ content. You can
make demons appear regardless. The people in charge of the lockdown will soon
realize that. Kaido calls him a nasty piece of work, and says he likes his
style.

Atsuro stutters, saying even if you’ve become overlord, won’t it be useless if
the SDF doesn’t trust you? Naoya agrees, so he says you’re going to prove your
strength here and now: declare war on god and call forth your demon army.
Everything will change; time to begin your new world.

Fushimi gets a message saying that demons are gathering at the Hills. But the
sky rift is still there...what’s going on? Yuzu, standing with Midori, says
that demons are all on the move and they won’t respond to COMPs any more. She
says your name, and then, "You’re...no longer human, are you?" Midori asks
what’s going to happen to them now; Yuzu doesn’t know, but says maybe it’s a
little comforting to know that you were the one who became the overlord. As
long as your heart stays human even during the battle ahead, that is...
Keisuke hopes that the world won’t be ruled by power, and that you’re safe.
The flashy gigolo guy laughs and says you’ve done it. "Well done, Naoya. Your
fondest wish has come true... Or has it?" Win this battle, and mankind may be
freed from God’s judgement. That is, if it doesn’t annihilate humanity, he
laughs; he’s looking forward to enjoying this from his box seat.

[All the Bels have been defeated, and the King of Bel has risen.

Witnessing a single young man drive the demons before him, the government saw
the lockdown’s futility and lifted it.

Eventually, the bizarre incidents that began in Tokyo spread across the country
and the world. Countless demons gathered under Abel to form an army. Shortly
afterward...the horn of battle sounded. Witnessing the cosmic struggle in awe,
mankind desperate joined hands with one another so as not to be dragged into
the conflict. They vowed to live as humans, outside the fray between angels and
demons.

In this time of suffering, man learned to live within its means.]

(The above is sad against a backdrop of images: the MC in an awesome black
cape, looking off into the distance; Kaido, looking off to the side; Naoya,
looking pleased; Atsuro, looking down with his face covered.)

From M:

Yuzu tells you to consider breaking through the lockdown. She doesn't want any
of you to die, and you've been trying so hard for a week but the last day's
tomorrow – what can you possibly do? Midori can't sort out her thoughts, and
Atsuro's convinced that you guys are the only ones who can change anything.
You have two chances to back out of the route – once with Yuzu, and once with
Atsuro.

In the morning, Midori tells you she just can't go through with this and wants
to try doing as much as she can inside the Yamanote circle, and leaves the
party. Keisuke agrees, and leaves with her. You'll then spend the rest of the
day checking various points in the circle, looking for a weak spot.

Kaido appears. He asks you if you've seen Honda around, and when you tell him
your plan to escape, he refuses, saying he won't die.

At Akasaka, Yuzu fervently hopes that Izuna won't be there to block the way,
but she's there all the same. You tell her you're just seeing how things are
and she replies that so far, the final option's all that's left. Your party
leaves, not wanting to fight her.

After looking at all the options, an event at Suidobashi appears. It's Naoya,
and he asks you what you intend to do now. You tell him your escape plans, and
he makes sure that's what you want – conviction is important, he says. He then
says he'll offer help – right now, your only plan is to search for a weak
point, but he knows that if you try breaking out, reserve squads will pour in
too quickly. Thus, he'll set up a diversion, splitting their forces in half.
However, he needs one more person to join in. You have until 16:00 to find one
more strong COMP user who can break free on his or her own, and then you'll
meet at Sunset Boulevard.

Several characters appear as options, depending on how you progressed
throughout the storyline: Gin, Kaido, Midori and Keisuke.

Gin won't go with you. He says that considering the options the government has
weighed, if they're willing to wipe out the circle, it must be worth it. Your
team argues, and he laughs, saying you're all really adults. He keeps saying
that he's tired, and that he'll relax and open up his bar later. He leaves
with a laugh, saying if you stop by, he'll give you free veggie juice.

Kaido doesn't respond well at first, but once your team tells him that you need
someone strong to be the bait and that he's strong enough to escape on his own,
he tells you to count him in. Atsuro fills him in on the meeting spot details.

You have the option of telling Midori and Keisuke about the plan, or keeping
silent. If you tell them, you'll eventually convince them to join your party
again.

At 13:30, you meet ???/flashy gigolo guy again. He says he's very disappointed
in you, and asks, do you know why he kept giving you information on the Bels?
He then reveals his true form – Loki, and says there's nothing he'd like better
than to kill you. You had the power to change the world and you threw it away,
he says, adding, "Or should I call you Abel?"

After you win the battle, Loki warns you that you'll have to fight through
angels, but just be a little more resolved this time, as he'll always be with
you now. With that, you can fuse him in the Cathedral of Shadows.

It's 16:00. Your team meets up with Naoya and Kaido at Ikebukuro. Naoya
explains the mission – he and Kaido will each be acting on his own, while
everyone else (your team) stays together. At 16:30, you'll attack one point to
the east and two to the west: Ueno, Shibuya, and Shinjuku, the latter of which
is merely a diversion. It's heavily guarded by SDF forces and is the central
point of the plan, as hitting it will draw all the reserve troops there.

Yuzu worries that your team will have to take the Shinjuku spot, saying it
sounds like a suicide mission, but Naoya laughs it off. He'll go there instead.
Yuzu says that'd be like leaving him to die, but he replies that he'll overload
multiple COMPs and let the demons take care of it. If he ever gets the chance,
he'll show you how to do it too, one day. Naoya also says that he's taking
Shinjuku because there are mostly SDF forces there, while only angels will be
at Ueno and Shibuya. He knows the team would rather fight angels than humans,
and tells the team to get as much revenge on them as it wants. Yuzu agrees,
saying, "Let me at those angels."

Kaido chooses the Ueno spot, saying he was getting "fed up" with Shibuya. Naoya
says it's a good choice, saying after the previous day's battle, it should be
easy to deal with. It leaves you with Shibuya. Atsuro worries about Naoya, but
he responds that people are merely tools to be used and discarded... He goes
on, saying that if either team breaks through, the lockdown will fail, and
he'll decide whether to press on or retreat then. Kaido realizes that
everyone's lives depend on each team and there's no possibility of betrayal.
Kaido agrees, emphasizing that a simultaneous strike is necessary; the SDF
will fear a fourth or fifth strike and won't commit too many troops, but by
the time they realize, it will be too late.

Kaido says that Naoya's not an ordinary guy and that there are too many like
him in the lockdown. Naoya agrees. Kaido says despite everything, he doesn't
hold a grudge, and hopes to meet everyone again.

Naoya instructs you to avoid the station and break through by the Electric
Museum, where you won't be out in the open. He tells you to remember not to
die, and says he's sunk pretty far if he's worried about you.

You fight against several angels, including Sariel and Anael. Amane and Izuna
appear several turns in, and both of them can't believe that you're trying to
break out of the lockdown. When you win, Yuzu apologizes to them, but can't
wait to get home. A cutscene kicks in.

[The attempt to break through the lockdown was hard, but successful. 

At last, you were headed back home. That was your wish, but the scene before
you was nothing like the world you all longed for...

Demons thrived as humans fled for their lives. What awaited you on the other
side was no different than what you left behind.]

Honda's waiting for you outside. He escaped, using you as a diversion. His son
didn't make it through the operation. He says he has nothing to fight for any
more, that power is justice, and that only they can change the world. Yuzu is
horrified. He asks what's wrong, calling the group heroes, saying there's no
more need to hesitate about using the demons.

You see a scene of carnage.

[The final option was never used, and the lockdown was lifted. Without the
angels' backing, the SDF suffered defeat after defeat against the demons Honda
and his comrades summoned.

The collapse is now inevitable.

The angels who could have prevented it have all been defeated by your own hand.

Months after the lockdown's end, in the new world ruled by the strong, when the
word "peace" has no meaning, you receive an email... ]

From "M":
   "Within a few nights, demons have stolen order from this world."

[You had understood that the lockdown was to prevent them from being loosed,
but you cast your eyes away. You did not run from demons. You did not run from
suffering. You ran from yourself.

If humans prove wise, then someday, peace may return to man's hands.

But you will live in regret until that day comes, son of man, in this world of
chaos you have brought upon yourself.]

Credits roll. You can now fuse Remiel in the Cathedral of Shadows.

|31. Frequently Asked Questions                                         [3101]|
=---=---------------------------------------------------------------------=---=

Help, I'm stuck at _____ battle and I thought I was at an okay level but your
strategy isn't working/I keep getting slaughtered/!!

 - It's all right if you're a few levels lower than the enemies you're
   fighting. Something that most people seem to forget is that -your demons
   also need to be at comparable levels to your team leaders throughout the
   game-. Especially if you're on the Last Day, they should not be...oh, let's
   say 7 levels below you. Keep your demons up to date. Honestly, truly,
   really.


I can't seem to find _______ skill...

 - There are three skills that are exclusive to certain routes:
    - Full Might - auto - Naoya, Atsuro's/Amane's route
      -- But, since his Anti-All only shows up on Amane's route...yes.
         Crack Full Might on the Atsuro route playthrough.
    - Magic Yin - auto - Amane, Naoya's route
    - Anti-All - passive - Naoya, Amane's route
 - Megidolaon's on Naoya (Amane's route) and Shiva. I'd recommend you crack
   it off Shiva, since you'll be losing out on Anti-All. Remember, Shiva shows
   up in a free battle at the top of the Hills building after you defeat
   Belberith (he's pretty rare, so be patient).


I followed the event flowchart for ____ route and -still- didn't unlock it!

 - Ah, yes, well. It's not perfect. Simply viewing all those events and meeting
   the routes' requirements won't unlock them. You know all those bits of
   dialogue where you have to make some kind of choice and say something? The
   game tallies up points based on how you answer things. If you don't answer
   smart, you won't unlock routes. For example, if you answer everything like
   you're a power-hungry demonic overlord who ridicules the idea of God, you're
   probably not going to unlock Amane's route. If you ignored Atsuro's ideas,
   you're probably not getting his. Etc, etc.


I'm having the hardest time, and I keep having to restart because I can't get
x character to crack y skill...

 - Just a reminder to everyone that you -can- access your team leaders' skills
   in the COMP menu (press Y while hovering above a certain char's avatar). And
   you can customize skills outside of battle. And you can have characters who
   can't equip a certain skill still crack it (it just appears gray in the
   menu). Just putting that out there, since some people seem to miss that.


Your Skill Crack list said that an ability would be available on the x'th day,
but I got it on the x-1'th day...

 - Free battles generate demons randomly. Sometimes, those demons have a
   different skill set than the normal, as well. Apologies (I didn't feel like
   duking it out with the RNG to get all possible results, what can I say), and
   treat it like a bonus?

Major thanks to Rae for recording some data for me, being supportive in her Rae
kind of way (re: "Remind me why you're doing this again?" Ahaha.), and helping
me try to figure out the data system behind the events system and whatnot. And
dealing with my guide-writing insecurities.

Also, thanks to:
 - Doug, for the info reminder on the extra Midori backstory event.
 - Everyone who wrote in about the demon auction's occasional accidents and
   the lack of penalty you get for defaulting on those. (So I have a faulty
   memory, like I thought. Oops.)
 - Brian, for reminding me of another auction demon with Watchful for the
   Mitama strategy.
 - Alex Hamerling, for telling me that the Atsuro event necessary for Gin's
   route isn't a mandatory one (so I put in the asterisks and warnings and all
   that).
 - Adam, for sending me the alternate email choices for Day 5.
 - Countless individuals for discussing the Recarm strategy.

And uh. Thanks for reading, and stuff. Hope this helped.
