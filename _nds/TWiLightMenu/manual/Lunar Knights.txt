/                                '----------'                          [OVER] \

  Lunar Knights is a continuation of the Boktai series, which was notable for
  its use of a solar sensor peripheral to affect the sunlight level in the
  game itself. The games pit humans against vampires in an eternal struggle,
  with the main character assuming the role of a vampire hunter. Boss battles
  in Boktai took place in two stages - a standard battle in which your
  character defeats the vampire and seals it in its coffin, followed by a sort
  of minigame in which the coffin must be dragged through the dungeon back
  outside to be purified in a sunlight-powered machine. This incarnation
  abandons the solar sensor for an internal day/night cycle, and replaces the
  coffin-dragging section with a space shooter not unlike Kingdom Hearts'.

  You begin the game as Lucian, an infamous vampire hunter and swordsman with
  a shady past. You soon join up with Aaron, the son of a previous Solar
  Gunner following in his father's footsteps. Once you control both
  characters you can switch between them in real-time, making use of their
  combined abilities to take down the vampires and free the world from their
  blanket of eternal darkness.

\                       .----------------------------.                        /
 =======================| Frequently Asked Questions |========================
/                       '----------------------------'                 [FAQS] \

- Is anything permanently missable in this game?

  Always leave a few open slots in your Accessory inventory and store the
  rest in the Solar Bank. When your inventory is full, the game is supposed
  to automatically store earned accessories in the Solar Bank, but there's a
  glitch that makes you lose them forever instead. To avoid this, don't let
  your Accessory inventory fill up completely.

  Don't use any Warrior's Ethics if you plan to reset your stats on a later
  playthrough. There are a limited number, and once you use them they're gone
  forever.

  Complete all quests before you clear the Dark Castle. You won't be able to
  obtain some quests after that point. You can still get them in your next
  playthrough, but you may have to complete earlier quests again.

  There are patrolling robots in a few areas that only show up the first time
  through. You'll probably want to evade them early on, but make sure to kill
  at least 1 in the Dark Castle to add their entry to your Monster Guide. You
  can still get the entry on your next playthrough.

- Why aren't any quests showing up on the Info Broker's list?

  You get quests by talking to people. Everyone has two lines that they
  alternate between, but if they have a mission for you, they'll give it
  after saying both of those lines. Just keep talking to them. Some people
  have multiple quests for you, but you have to beat one before they'll give
  you the next.

- I'm on my second playthrough and I can't get a certain quest. What gives?

  When you start a New Game+, you lose any quest progress as far as NPCs
  are concerned. Make sure you re-complete the first quest in an area
  before trying to get the second.

- How do I activate weather statues?

  Weather statues do not affect the weather, but are affected *by* it. They
  exist solely to point out an area that can only be accessed under certain
  weather conditions. You'll have to use a Burst attack with the appropriate
  terrennial or change the climate at Sheridan's mansion (sometimes both) in
  order to get the conditions just right. Leave the room and re-enter to
  activate the path.

- What's the best way to earn money quickly?

  Collect items that are worth a lot of money and sell them off. The best
  way to do this is with dungeon-specific breakables, such as the luggage in
  Santa Cecilia Station or the amber crystals in Dark Castle Auguste. For
  Santa Cecilia, set the climate to Tropical Rainforest then head to a room
  with lots of the breakables (the open train cars are great for this). You
  will get Duke Photos under most conditions, but it's possible to get the
  more valuable Poster Girl Photos during a rainstorm (not a Tove burst,
  not a thunderstorm, not normal rain - you'll hear a warning buzz when it
  starts). 

- How should I distribute my status points from leveling up?

  Skill is by far the most useful stat - enemies can't hurt you if you can
  kill them first. Spend at least twice as many points on Skill as you do on
  any other stat. After that, Spirit is important for Aaron (since he can't
  attack without Energy, and needs a lot of it if you're out of sunlight),
  while Lucian doesn't really need it at all. Lucian benefits from Vitality,
  since he'll probably get hit a lot when fighting close-up, but Aaron still
  needs some too. Once you start getting into the bonus content with high-
  level monsters, you may find Aaron to be more useful than Lucian, so spend
  all of your Warrior's Ethics on him. Don't use any Warrior's Ethics if you
  plan on resetting your stats when you start a New Game+, since you can't
  ever get them back.

- What's the best way to get Junk Parts?

  Most parts can be bought from the store once you're far enough along in
  the story, but the last four types have to be found. If you've already
  beaten the game you can do the minigames at Sheridan's Mansion, but that's
  a lot of work. Your best bet is probably to set the climate to Balmy
  Subtropical and hope for a meteor shower on a clear night. Find a room with
  a lot of enemies that drop the part you want, and harvest them repeatedly.
  You might have to re-enter the room twice to get some enemies to respawn.

- How do I break colored blocks / activate elemental switches?

  Equip the terrennial of the opposite alignment (Sol/Dark, Flame/Frost,
  Earth/Cloud) and attack the block/switch. If there are multiple switches
  in an area, you may have to turn them all to the same color (try both).

- Why can't I use a certain terrennial / weapon?

  Lucian cannot equip Toasty and Aaron cannot equip Nero, but if there are
  other terrennials that don't show up when you hold down L, chances are
  you accidentally disabled it under the Terrennials menu. Highlight the
  terrennial and press A to enable it again. The same thing can happen with
  weapons.

- Why do I keep getting kicked back to the world map after a boss fight?

  See that screen that says Ready! [Hold on]? It's a decision box, and you
  need to press left to highlight Ready! in order to continue.

- I need Aaron to hit a switch, but he's dead. What do I do?

  Just let Lucian die too and you can both be revived for a small fee. You
  will lose any progress in the current room, as well as your TRC gauge. An
  inn will also heal you at the expense of your TRC. Alternatively, if you
  have reached Armed Train Irving, you can head back to the first car there
  for free healing and you won't lose anything.

  Lunar Knights uses the stats Life, ENE, VIT, SPR, and SKILL.

  Life:   The amount of damage the character can take before dying.
  Energy: Stamina reserves used for running and attacking with terrennials.

  Vitality: Boosts a character's maximum life.
  Spirit:   Boosts a character's maximum energy.
  Skill:    Boosts a character's attack power.

  Your characters improve their abilities by leveling up, which requires EXP
  from defeating enemies. When a character levels up, he gets a Life and ENE
  boost. In addition to those direct boosts, a character gains Status Points
  which can be used toward upgrading the three secondary stats. Don't forget
  to use these, as your stats won't automatically improve when you level up!
  Both main characters have the same level growth chart:

  Level up:   +18 Life, +30 ENE
  1 VIT:      +100 Life
  1 SPR:      +110 ENE
  VIT cost:   4 + floor(base VIT/10)
  SPR cost:   3 + floor(base SPR/10)
  SKILL cost: 4 + floor(base SKILL/10)
  Total cost: 300 + 250 + 300 (50 VIT, 50 SPR, 50 SKILL)

  For example, it will still only cost Lucian 3 SP to upgrade his VIT to level
  10, but it will cost him 4 SP to upgrade it to level 11.

  Note that since you only get 607 SP from level ups and you would need 850
  total, you won't be able to max out every stat, even if you use all your
  Warrior's Ethics on one character. Since Lucian doesn't need any ENE to
  attack, I recommend that you don't bother upgrading his SPR, and use all
  your Warrior's Ethics on Aaron instead. Spend at least twice as many points
  on SKILL than you do on other stats for both characters, since the best
  defense is a good offense.

/                                 '---------'                          [WTHR] \

  Lunar Knights uses an in-game day/night cycle, which progresses constantly
  during gameplay and is unrelated to the real time of day. During the day,
  the intensity of the sun naturally waxes and wanes, beginning at a low level
  when the sun is at the horizon and growing as the sun travels directly
  overhead, then dying out as the sun disappears again. The lunar cycle works
  in a similar manner.

  In addition to the simple light cycle is a weather system, which introduces
  three new measurements for you to consider: Temperature, Humidity, and Wind
  Speed. These don't directly affect your characters, but they do have
  various side-effects on your items and the environment. They are directly
  influenced by the local climate.

  Additionally, there are a variety of meteorological events that can occur,
  many of them specific to a single climate.

  - Clouds: Light is blocked out.

  - Rain: Fills pools containing Sunken Platforms, raising them up to your
    level.

  These events are all announced with a warning buzz as they appear:

  - Hail: Has a 25% chance of occurring in Frigid Arctic in cloudy weather.
    Outside, damages both the player and enemies by 1% of their max HP.

  - Snowstorm: Has a 20% chance of occurring in freezing temperatures. Slows
    movement speed for both the player and enemies.

  - Meteor Shower: Has a 20% chance of occurring in moderate conditions on
    clear nights. Enemies always drop items, with a 50% chance of a rare
    drop.

  - Rainbow: Has a 45% chance of occurring after rain in clear skies.
    Increases the drop rate of common items by 20%.

  - Aurora: Has a 30% chance of occurring in freezing temperatures on clear
    nights. Doubles earned Exp and Soll.

  - Squall: Has a 25% chance of occurring in Tropical Rainforest. Outdoors,
    reduces visibility and renders whistling useless.

  - Sandstorm: Has a 20% chance of occurring during the day in Arid Desert.
    Outdoors, reduces visibility and renders whistling useless.

  - Thunderstorm: Has a 30% chance of occurring instead of rainfall.
    Illuminates otherwise invisible objects.

  At the beginning of the game, the world is locked in permanent darkness,
  but as you defeat the vampires you gain access to new climates that can be
  selected between levels. The climates are as follows:

  Balmy Subtropical (Chapter 1)
   "A warm, hospitable climate."
   - Moderate temperature, humidity, and wind speed
   - 20% chance of Meteor Shower at night

  Arid Desert (Chapter 3)
   "A dry climate that seldom sees rainfall."
   - High temperature, low humidity, mid-high wind speed
   - Sandstorm

  Tropical Rainforest (Chapter 4)
   "High temperatures and copious amounts of rain make this a perfect climate
    for plant life."
   - High temperature and humidity, low-mid wind speed
   - Rain, Thunderstorm

  Humid Continental (Chapter 4)
   "A windy climate where snow often takes the place of rain."
   - Low temperature, high humidity, high wind speed
   - Sleet

  Frigid Arctic (Chapter 5)
   "An extremely cold climate with frequent ice and snow."
   - Low temperature, humidity, and wind speed
   - Snow, Aurora

  Note that some meteorological events occur based on the temperature,
  humidity, and wind speed rather than climate itself. However, the standard
  conditions for each climate are optimal for the events listed.

  Scattered around the various dungeons are Weather Statues. These statues do
  not actually change the weather - they are only there to point out that the
  room has a path in it that opens up under certain conditions. The surest
  way to activate one of these weather-dependent paths is to change the
  climate to one with the desired weather characteristics, but a burst attack
  may also work if you don't mind expending your TRC gauge.

  - Flooded Path: dries up at temperatures above 86ºF (30ºC)
  - Solar Roots: grow across a gap at 75% humidity and above
  - Glider: lets you cross a gap at wind speeds above 13.4 mph (6 m/s)
  - Toxic Sludge: freezes over at temperatures below 32ºF (0ºC)
  - Sunken Platform: floats up during rainfall

  When the weather conditions are right for the path, its Weather Statue will
  glow.

/                                '----------'                          [ELEM] \

  There are six elements in Lunar Knights, arranged in opposing pairs. Each
  element has an affinity for a particular environmental condition.

  Sol   - Yellow - Strong sunlight
  Dark  -  Black - Strong moonlight
  Flame -   Red  - High temperature
  Frost -  Blue  - Low temperature
  Earth - Green  - High humidity
  Cloud - Purple - High wind speed

  Lucian's weapons have no inherent elemental attribute, while Aaron's guns
  cannot fire at all without an element. That's where Terrennials come into
  play. Terrennials are the elemental spirits of the planet, and each adds
  a particular element to a character's attacks.

 Terrennials/Seireijuu:

 [Nero] - Chapter 1
     - The terrennial that governs over darkness.
     - Adds the Dark element to attacks.
     - In Trance mode, press the B Button for a ranged attack, or the Y
       Button for a life-absorbing attack that can be chained.
     - After the Trance, the time will be set to night.

 [Toasty] (Otenko) - Chapter 2
     - The terrennial that governs over light.
     - Adds the Sol element to attacks.
     - In Trance mode, press the B Button for a ranged attack, or the Y
       Button for an energy-absorbing attack that can be chained.
     - After the Trance, the time will be set to afternoon.

 [Ursula] - Chapter 3
     - The terrennial that governs over flame.
     - Adds the Flame element to attacks.
     - In Burst mode, draw a circle on the Touch Screen to summon a damaging
       rain of firebombs.
     - After the Burst, the local weather will become clear and temperature
       will rise.

 [Alexander] (Ottfried) - Chapter 4
     - The terrennial that governs over wind.
     - Adds the Cloud element to attacks.
     - In Burst mode, draw a swirl on the Touch Screen to summon a damaging
       tornado. Move the swirl around to change the tornado's position.
     - After the Burst, the local wind speed will rise.

 [Tove] - Chapter 4
     - The terrennial that governs over earth.
     - Adds the Earth element to attacks.
     - In Burst mode, slide your finger on the Touch Screen to summon a
       damaging earthquake.
     - After the Burst, the local humidity will rise.

 [Ezra] (Liza) - Chapter 5
     - The terrenial that governs over ice.
     - Adds the Frost element to attacks.
     - In Burst mode, blow into the microphone to summon a damaging frigid
       blast.
     - After the Burst, the local weather will become rainy or snowy.

 [War Rock] (JP-only Ryuusei no Rockman crossover)
     - Has no element or favorite climate.
     - In Burst mode, touch the screen to fire the Rock Buster.
     - Does more damage the stronger your Brother Band partner.

  Lucian has the Dark Terrennial from the start, and Aaron gets the Sol
  Terrennial early on. Lucian cannot use Sol and Aaron cannot use Dark, at
  least in the US version. In the JP version there are some Wi-Fi exclusive
  items that allow Django (Aaron) to equip Nero and Sabata (Lucian) to equip
  Otenko (Toasty). These might still be obtained with Action Replay codes,
  however.

  When the environment is favorable to the Terrennial you have equipped, it
  may start to glow. You can then activate a special effect unique to that
  Terrennial by whistling (blowing into the microphone). I'll list the US
  and JP versions with their respective Imperial and metric scales.

  Terrennial     Available                  Effect
     Nero     around midnight   Steals item/Soll from an enemy.
    Toasty      around noon     Recovers some of your energy.
    Ursula     86ºF or above    Attacks and stuns an enemy.
   Alexander  13.4 mph winds    Knocks back and stuns nearby enemies.
     Tove      75%+ humidity    Recovers some of your health.
     Ezra      32ºF or below    Freezes an enemy.

  Seireijuu      Available                  Effect
     Nero     around midnight   Steals item/Soll from an enemy.
    Otenko      around noon     Recovers some of your energy.
    Ursula     30ºC or above    Attacks and stuns an enemy.
   Ottfried     6 m/s winds     Knocks back and stuns nearby enemies.
     Tove      75%+ humidity    Recovers some of your health.
     Liza      0ºC or below     Freezes an enemy.
   War Rock       anytime       Turns dropped Soll into items.

===============================================================================

You begin the game in a pub, overhearing two patrons discussing the vampire
menace and the permanent night shrouding the world. It seems people are being
treated like cattle in the vampires' city, carted off and drained of blood
until they turn undead. Staying under the local vampire lord, Margrave Rymer,
isn't much better - he hunts humans for sport. Your character seems to be
looking for a different vampire, but this is the only lead he has, so off we
go to knock on (down?) his door...

[Front Gate]
- Barrel x2
~ Yellow Slime A x2

The first dungeon encompasses the grounds in front of Rymer's mansion. There
are monsters right off the bat, so your familiar Nero explains how to attack.

Now is also a good time to get familiar with the controls. Your character has
an affinity for moonlight, and conveniently it's permanently night here. Hold A
to gather energy and fill up your bar. The stronger the light, the faster your
energy gauge will fill. The game will explain more about energy when you need
to know.

A bit about enemies - they always drop Soll, the currency of this world, and
occasionally drop an item too. Check the Enemies section for complete enemy
info. Most enemies respawn if you leave the room; some only if you go two rooms
away. Right now you don't receive any experience points or items for killing
enemies, so don't worry about that for now. They will still drop money, though.
The denominations of money drops are as follows:

Green Coin:       5 Soll
Bronze Coin:     10 Soll
Gold Coin:       50 Soll
Silver Crystal: 250 Soll
Gold Crystal:   500 Soll

The only enemies here are Yellow Slimes, which are very docile until you come
into close contact with them. If you touch them or attack them, they'll counter
with a pouncing attack. At your current strength they take two hits to kill, so
try and finish them off with a one-two combo to prevent their counterattack.

[Outer Walkway]
! Sun Shards
! Hint Panel: Dashing
~ Crow A x2
~ Yellow Slime A x2
<NIGHT>
~ Ghoul A x2
<DAY>
~ Skeleton A x2

This room introduces a few new things: first, spawning enemies. These aren't
visible when you first enter a room. They appear out of the ground when you
approach, or often as an ambush when you go for a treasure chest. These Ghouls
will run toward you when they're close enough, so don't let their apparent
slowness fool you. They also have a pouncing counterattack, and they take three
hits to kill, so only a full combo will avert it. Blocking will be explained in
detail later, but for now if you can't avoid one try and press B before it hits
you.

There are also Crows here, which start off as easy targets on the ground but
have a quick diving attack if you allow them to get into the air.

Finally, you may see a green glint appear on the ground. That's a sign of Sun
Shards. If you get close enough, they will surface and burst into firefly-like
creatures called Terra Bugs, of which there are three types:

Life Bug (green): Heals 5% of your Life
Spirit Bug (yellow): Heals 5% of your Energy
Spirit Leech (black): Drains 2.5% of your Energy

Very convenient in dungeons, and the Leech variety are relatively rare, so you
should always seek these out. They respawn if you leave the room, and they'll
come to you if you hold A as if you were charging energy. That telltale sparkle
only shows up at night, though.

You can't proceed until you read the hint panel about Dashing, so go ahead and
do that.

[Inner Walkway]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Cure Drop
~ Yellow Slime A x4
<NIGHT>
~ Ghoul A x3
<DAY>
~ Skeleton A x3

Your very first treasure chest! Orange ones respawn when you revisit a level,
while green/blue ones are one-shot, often holding rare or unique items. The
contents of some chests can vary depending on your situation. Some chests only
give you a particular item once, so if you have already opened the chest on a
previous playthrough then it will contain a different item. Additionally, some
items cannot be obtained on Normal difficulty.

[Veranda]
! Sun Shards
! Hint Panel: Saving
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Mandragora x2
~ Yellow Slime A x4
<NIGHT>
~ Ghoul A x4
<DAY>
~ Skeleton A x4

Time for a story event. Bea is here to rescue her captured colleagues, but you
couldn't care less. At least you get to give yourself a name now. Since the
default is Lucian (JP: Sabata), that's what I'll be using to refer to the Dark
Swordsman from now on.

[Hilltop]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Healing Potion
~ Crow A x3
~ Spider x6

Spiders show up in this room. They're pretty docile - I don't think I've ever
been attacked by one - but they lay invisible webs that ensnare you until you
pull free. There are some breakable wooden blocks protecting chests, but as you
demonstrated during the last cutscene, that won't stop you. To the right is a
room blocked off by colored blocks. There are six colors in all, each
representing an element, and you need to use an attack with the opposite
element to break an elemental block or hit an elemental switch. Needless to say
you don't have any elemental attacks yet, so you'll have to come back later.
For now head left.

[Glider Room]
! Earth block blocking the entrance
! Glider: lets you cross a gap at wind speeds above 13.4 mph (6 m/s)
- Green Chest:
  · Protect Fruit
  · Sky Runner (Hard Mode, first time)

[Corridor]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Jar x2
~ Pork A x4
~ Yellow Slime A x2

Here Nero explains how to use your shield. Your guard counter decreases when
you block, and if it hits zero you'll be stunned for a while. Fortunately, it
recovers when you're not using it. Also, if you hit the guard button right
before an attack (called a "Quick Guard"), you won't lose any guard meter, and
you'll often stun the enemy or reflect their attack back at them. This is the
best way to deal with certain enemies.

You can practice on the Porks here for a while, but be careful not to stand
near their bodies after you kill them, as they explode. This can sometimes
work to your advantage since it hits other enemies too.

When you're comfortable with guarding, stop by the room full of breakables
(south) before heading north.

[Garden]
- Mandragora x10
- Crate x2
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: random Ryuusei item (after completing crossover quest in JP version)

[Courtyard]
! Trap: Defeat all the monsters!
~ Skeleton B x2

It's a trap! Defeat the two Skeletons to continue. They've got a mean punch, so
don't get caught with your guard down. It'll take quite a few hits since
they're level 3, but they're not particularly fast. Once you defeat them you'll
level up immediately and Nero will explain the basics of levels and status
points. You earn points every time you level up which can be spent in three
categories:
Vitality: Increases your maximum Life
Spirit: Increases your maximum Energy
Skill: Increases your attack power

You should distribute your status points in the way that best fits your own
play style. With Lucian, I almost never use Energy and prefer strength over
defense, so I go for Skill alone early on with a few points into Vitality
whenever I start losing too much life from enemies. Again, you should go with
the ratio that best supports the way you play - there's no "right" way to
distribute the points.

Anyway, you can finally earn experience now! Still no item drops yet, though.

[Terrace]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Earth Fruit (partially obscured by the tree near the entrance)
- Chest: Earth Fruit (partially obscured by the tree near the second statue)
- Crate x2
- Mandragora x2
~ Crow B x4
~ Ghoul B x4
~ Lion Statue x2
~ Pork B x2

The enemies have all leveled up now. Also new is the first stationary enemy,
the Lion Statue. These shoot fireballs, which can be blocked, but if possible
you should just sneak by as fast as possible to reach its vulnerable sides or
back. A combo or two should break it apart.

[Crossbridge]
! Sun Shards
! Hint Panel: Lever Switches
- Chest: Solar Fruit
~ Crow B x3
~ Ghoul B x2
~ Lion Statue x2
~ Pork B x1
~ Yellow Slime B x3

Hit the lever here to open the door. There's a room to the right but there are
blocks in the way, so just head up.

[Statue Room]
! Frost blocks blocking the entrance
- Green Chest:
  · Warrior's Ethic (first time)
  · Magical Drink
~ Lion Statue x4

[Pond]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Barrel x2
- Mandragora x2
~ Crow B x4
~ Ghoul B x4
~ Lion Statue x4

It may be tempting to go right for the chest, but it's surrounded by Ghouls
that appear when you approach it. You might want to take out the Crows first.

[Prep Room]
! Sun Crystal
- Green Chest:
  · Leather Suit (first time)
  · Delicious Meat

Whenever you see this kind of room you know that a boss is ahead. A Sun Crystal
generates green Terra Bugs whenever you stand next to it, allowing you to heal
your life to maximum.

You'll also get an explanation of accessories here. Equip your new armor and
enjoy the extra Life boost.

It wanders around leaping and firing Sol Shots most of the time. Try to stay
out of its direct line of fire and you should be able to dodge most of those.
If you get close to it, it may rear back and start glowing. That's your cue
that it's going to bite. If you manage to Quick Guard the lunge you'll stun
it, so try that if you're daring. Otherwise, move to the side and get a combo
in. You could just block and let your guard counter soak up the hit, but don't
just stand there or it will bite you and start absorbing your Life.
When its tail grows four spikes and glows red it's about to swing in a
large circle, so get your guard up. If it glows red with a single spike it will
stab out in one direction. If you hit it right after an attack you should
always be able to get a full combo in, and maybe another one while it hunches
over afterwards if you're quick.

After your victory, you get a call from Alice, who has been monitoring your
progress. She suggests paying a visit to Professor Sheridan, who knows a great
deal about alchemy and may be able to unlock the dark sword's true power.

----------------------------[ Sheridan's Mansion ]-----------------------------

After charging in, you show the sword to the professor. He needs 4 IRON and 2
SOLVENT to augment the sword. Nero explains how to interact with the world map,
and then you're given free control over where to go next. You could go ahead
and storm Rymer's mansion now, but you should probably check out the town
first.

-----------------------------------[ Acuna ]-----------------------------------

The IRON you need to upgrade your sword is available at the General Store. You
can also get it from Spiders, Red Slimes and a chest in the mansion, but you'll
need so much of it to fully upgrade all your weapons that no amount you buy
here will go to waste. Items are plentiful in dungeons, so you shouldn't need
to buy anything else here. There are some accessories that you probably can't
afford yet, but I prefer to save my money for junk parts to use in weapon
upgrades.

Stop by the pub at the beginning of each chapter for some helpful advice and
plot details. You can also get your first quest from the shopkeeper by talking
to him a few times. Check the Quests section for more details about quests.

Also, enemies will start dropping items now, so you can return to the Forecourt
and get some SOLVENT from Ghouls if you want to upgrade your weapon right away.
Once you've familiarized yourself with the resources available at the town and
done any upgrading, head over to the Hunting Mansion proper.

You find yourself inside Rymer's mansion. Unfortunately, this means you are cut
off from the moonlight, your source of energy. This is where those Solar Fruits
you picked up in the previous dungeon will come in handy.

Nero will explain the basics of Terrennials and elemental affinities here.
Equipping a Terrennial to your weapon will add its element to your attack,
making it deal more damage to enemies with the opposite element and less
damage to enemies with the same element. It just so happens that the enemies
right in front of you are weak to Dark, so try it out.

You can't break the Cloud blocks in the eastern room yet, so for now make sure
7to grab the chest from the broken staircase to the north before proceeding
west.

Here Nero will explain the Trance Gauge. You gain TRC by attacking
enemies, and you can unleash a powerful Trance attack that changes depending on
which Terrennial you have equipped.

The Ghouls in these next few rooms can drop Solvent for your Vanargand. Watch
out for the Axe Armor statues. They may look stationary, but they'll try and
take your head off if you walk in front of them. Just as with the Lion Statues,
take these out from the side.

In the next room Nero points out a skylight. These are very convenient sources
of light, but they're few and far between in dungeons, so try not to rely on
them.

Up the stairs you'll find more Skeletons. Try guarding and countering after
they hit, or make sure you can take them out in one combo. There are also some
pillars that shoot jets of fire. Shouldn't have to tell you that walking into
them is not the best idea.

[Prison Block]

Next you'll see a story sequence. There's a room attached to one of the cells,
but you need a key to get into them, so keep moving.

You're introduced to Solar Stations in the next room. At the bank in town,
Soll can be used to charge these stations for a quick boost right before
bosses. I never needed it (I'm pretty stingy) but you might find it useful.

Don't stand in front of his drill. Even if you block, it'll break your guard.
If he points his crossbow up, keep moving, because flaming bolts are about to
land on your head. His standard crossbow attack can be blocked without too much
trouble, as well as deflected by the pillars, but he also fires a burst of
grenades that cannot be blocked. Watch them and make sure you're not standing
where they land.

For a really easy time, go into Trance with Nero and spam Y to kill him.

The battle's over, but you're not done yet. Vampire's can't truly be killed
until they're exposed to direct sunlight, and since the paraSOL is preventing
that, you've got to drag his coffin to OUTER SPACE!!!

You'll be switching to another character soon. If you have anything left to
take care of in town, select 'Hold on' at the decision prompt. If you're ready
to move on, press left on the control pad to select 'Ready!'.

Luckily, this time around you have a giant robot to move the coffin instead of
just a chain. Time for some space combat. The minigame itself is pretty self-
explanatory - tap enemy ships to shoot them and hold the stylus on your own
ship to move it around. I'll just give a few tips for the bosses:

Bomber: You have enough time to get in a couple hits between each of its shots.
Move out of the way right after it fires and you won't get hit, but you still
need to dodge its charge once it finishes a salvo. Be patient and don't try to
get too many hits in at once and you'll be fine.

Schrödinger: She alternates between two patterns. In the first one she'll
simply dodge around the screen. Keep your pointer trained on the ship and you
can get a bunch of free hits in. Next she'll come in firing rapid lasers, so
just fly in quick circles and you should avoid most of it. When she's down to
about half health, she'll start firing missiles. Again, don't bother doing
anything but dodging during her attack phase and you'll get through the battle
just fine.

Congratulations, you just unlocked a new Terrennial. Time to try it out!

[Hideout Antechamber]
- Green Chest:
  · Red Cross (first time)
  · Yogurt
- Chest: random Ryuusei item (after completing crossover quest in JP version)

[Hideout Training Room]
- Chest: Magical Drink
- Invisible Chest: IRON

The guild is under attack! Since your gun isn't working, you'll need to make
your way out of the building without fighting, and save your comrades along the
way.

You can't get back in here once your mission starts, but be sure to pay a visit
once you finish the dungeon, as a very useful shield is sitting in the next
room. There's a hidden chest with some IRON in the top corner.

[Hideout 1F East]
! Guild Member
- Sun Shards
- Green Chest:
  · Chocolate
  · Sound Data DEMO 2 (Hard mode, first time)
- Crate x2
~ Hound x1

Since you don't have a working weapon yet, do your best to avoid the Hounds
while rescuing the other guild members. With Hounds as with any other
patrolling enemies, you can whistle (blow into the microphone) to call them
over to your location. If you ever need them to stand on a pressure switch or
to move away from a path you need to take, you can call them over, but you have
to quickly run somewhere out of their view or they'll spot you and attack.

If you do happen to get spotted, you can guard the Hounds' pounce attack, but
they have a short recovery time, so your best option is to leave the room and
come back. That will reset enemy positions and give you another chance to sneak
past.

There's a guildsman right around the corner to your left, so wait for the
nearby Hound to wander off and sneak around the corner to talk to him. He'll
teach you how to look farther off using the X button. Head up and grab the
chest, then go upstairs.

[Hideout 2F South]
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Jar x2
~ Hound x2

Hang back until the nearby Hound moves on. Use the X button to check for Hounds
before moving to another pillar, and make sure to grab the two chests before
taking the staircase down.

[Hideout 1F West]
! Guild Member
- Barrel x2
~ Hound x3

The exit is the door at the top, but there are two more guild members to be
rescued first. Make your way cautiously around the boxes to the left side to
find the woman, then back around to the right side and take the staircase.

[Hideout 2F North]
! Guild Member

Once everyone is out, make your way back downstairs to the center, where a
Hound is standing guard in front of the door. Whistle and run around behind a
group of crates and the Hound should run out from its hiding place - just make
sure the other one isn't nearby when you whistle or it'll come running too.
Sneak behind the guard (or just run, since they won't follow you through doors)
and step out into the sunlight.

[Hideout Back Entrance]
! Event: Healing Potion, Magic Potion
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Trash x2
~ Crow A x2

Bit of a story sequence. You now have a working weapon! Pick a name for your
character (I'll be calling him Aaron) and get acquainted with your newfound
terrennial, Toasty (JP: Otenko).

Aaron plays quite differently than Lucian. You will want to do most of your
fighting from a safe distance, and you have to keep elemental resistances in
mind since you can't fire a Solar Gun without a terrennial equipped. This means
that you have to pay more attention to your ENE than you would with Lucian, so
you may want to focus on Spirit more than Vitality. Skill still takes top
priority for me, though. It should come as no surprise that Aaron gathers his
energy from the sun rather than the moon, and you don't have much ENE to start
with, so indoor areas will be more of a challenge.

To automatically lock-on to the nearest enemy, hold R. Release and hold it
again to switch to the next enemy if there is one.

If you haven't noticed the freshness meter yet, it's a little circle next to
item names in your inventory. In the last chapter items never went bad, but now
you have to keep track of your perishables. For instance, an Earth Fruit heals
30% of your Life but can rot, while a Candy Drop only restores 20% of your Life
but never goes bad. It's possible to preserve some items in certain weather
conditions (check the Item Conversions section), but for now, just keep in mind
that if you dawdle for too long you'll start losing your perishables.

[Back Alley South]
- Chest: Milk
~ Black Slime A x3

Here Toasty will explain the lock-on feature. The Black Slimes are weak to Sol,
which is good, because that's all you can shoot for now. There's a green chest
across the canal, but we'll get around to it later.

[The Loop]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Trash x2
- Crate x2
~ Black Slime A x4
~ Crater x2
~ Crow A x4
~ Skeleton A x1
~ Spider A x2

Toasty explains his Trance attack here. Pretty much the same as Nero's, but Sol
element. This room also introduces the nasty Crater enemy, which lobs grenades
at you from a distance. Keep moving and fire a shot off each time you avoid a
grenade. They have a large splash damage area and fly fast, so don't stand
still for too long or you'll be blasted. Try and use X so that you can just
barely see a Crater, lock on, then fire at it from offscreen (and outside
its range). Take the leftmost of the two remaining exits for this room.

[Back Alley Center]
! Sun Shards
- Green Chest: STEEL
~ Crow A x3
~ Skeleton A x2

Grab the junk part from the chest and return to The Loop, this time taking the
far right exit.

[Back Alley North]
~ Crow A x2
~ Pork A x2

You're barely going to do any damage to the Porks since they're Sol elemental.
Not much you can do about that but hammer the fire button and block when they
charge, or just avoid fighting them entirely.

[Side Street]
! Sun Shards x2
- Chest: Milk
~ Crow A x5
~ Hound x1
~ Pork A x2
~ Skeleton A x3

Nothing too remarkable about this room. Use the ample Sun Shards to fill up,
and keep an eye out for the Hound patrolling near the left end.

[Concourse South]
! Sun Shards
- Trash x3
- Jar x2

Meet your next vampire foes, Edgar and Virginia Poe. The guild leaders will
show up and hold them off while you help more guild members escape. There's a
room to the east that you can't reach until you finish this chapter.

[Item Cache]
- Chest: Healing Potion
- Barrel x3
- Trash x6
- Jar x4

This area is inaccessible during your first visit to 13th Street, but it's a
great place to find breakables on a return visit.

[Rooftops South]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Trash x2
~ Black Slime B x3
~ Crow B x6
~ Hound x1
~ Pork B x4

Stop by the room at street level to rescue a guild member.

[Storage Room]
! Sun Shards
! Guild Member

Go back outside and head upstairs. There's a room to the south but you can't
access it yet, and neither can you reach the guild member on the other side of
a fence in this room, so head north.

[Glider Room]
! Earth blocks blocking the entrance
! Glider: lets you cross a gap at wind speeds above 13.4 mph (6 m/s)
- Green Chest:
  · Hresvelgr Arms (first time)
  · Yogurt
- Barrel x2

[Rooftops North]
- Green Chest:
  · Power Fruit
  · Warrior's Ethic (first time on Nightmare Mode)
~ Black Slime B x4
~ Skeleton B x4

Grab the Power Fruit from the chest. If you're worried about it rotting and
don't want to waste it, rearrange your items so that there's a Chocolate
directly above it and allow the Chocolate to melt. The resulting item won't
rot and it'll be twice as powerful too. Go left and south to enter the fenced-
off section of the rooftops that you passed by earlier.

[Rooftops South]
! Guild Member
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Crate x3
~ Black Slime B x4
~ Crow B x2

Another guild member to rescue here; not much else. Go back to Rooftops North
and start heading right, down the stairs. Head through the door to enter the
building you were just walking on.

[The Lodge]
~ Chloroformin' x2
~ Pork B x2

Make your way up the stairs.

[Rooftops North]
! Sun Shards x5
! Guild Member
- Crate x2
- Jar x3

Lots of Sun Shards up here, but watch out for the trapdoors. Talk to the last
guild member and make your way back out of the building. Head right to reach
the exit.

[Concourse Center]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Chest: Milk
- Invisible Chest: Earth Fruit
- Invisible Chest: Solar Fruit
~ Crater x5
~ Pork B x4
~ Skeleton B x6

More Craters in the top half of the room. There are invisible chests in the
southern corners. You can't return to Concourse - South, so go right.

[East Court]
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
~ Hound x2

More loot. At this point you should be strong enough to take out the Hounds
without much trouble. Return to Concourse - Center and make your way through
the bombardment up to the next room.

[Concourse North]
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Barrel x2

Kill the enemies if you want the Exp/Soll, then head up again.

                                Element:  Dark

The snake tail spits gobs of poison. You can knock them away by guarding, but
the chimera won't be affected. It will growl when it's preparing to charge.
Don't try to guard its charge, as it'll just knock you over. It's pretty fast,
so you may want to actually run out of the way. Don't let it get too close
either, or you'll be hit by its poison breath attack.
If you can get it to charge into a pole it'll be stunned for a couple seconds,
so use them for cover. You can get a lot of hits in while it's stunned or using
its poison breath attack, and you can try to get some in between its other
attacks but that's more risky.

Lucian is again hanging out in a pub in search of information, and it just
happens to be the one in Old Culiacan. Bea enters with a lead on Ernest and
Kay's location and drags Lucian into the rescue mission along with Aaron. You
now have control of both characters! Switch between them with Select during
gameplay or by tapping the portrait in the start menu. She also hands over the
Witch and Ernest's Solar Goggles. Check out the new wares and quests available,
then head into the sewers. You may want to select the Arid Desert climate
before entering, as it will unlock some extra treasure.

[Entrance]
! Sun Shards
! Skylight
- Green Chest:
  · Elixir
  · Warrior's Ethic (Hard Mode, first time)
- Invisible Chest: Clairvoyance Fruit
- Barrel x2
- Crate x4
- Jar x1
~ Bat A x15
~ !Ghoul A x13
~ Hound x1
~ Pig A x8
~ Spider x2

Make your way through the room in a clockwise manner starting at the top right
corner to get everything. You might find it helpful to use R-targeting to find
Bats and pick them off from a distance.

[Flooded Room]
! Sun Shards x3
! Skylight
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Chest: Solar Fruit
~ Bat A x3
~ Black Slime A x8
~ Chloroformin' x6
~ Ghoul A x7

! Flooded Path: dries up at temperatures above 86ºF (30ºC)
- Green Chest:
  · Warrior's Ethic (first time)
  · Antidote

That suspicious-looking chest between four pillars is indeed an ambush. If you
grab the fruit and keep moving you can get outside the Ghoul perimeter before
they finish spawning and fight them without getting surrounded.

Alice will contact you to explain Weather Statues. They indicate that a nearby
path is only accessible under certain weather conditions - you don't need to be
in any particular climate so long as the conditions are in the correct range,
but changing the climate is the surest way to activate the path. You could also
try a burst attack with the appropriate terrennial to change the weather
temporarily.  As for the particular statue in front of you, it will glow when
the temperature is hot enough, indicating that the water has evaporated. This
allows you to walk down there and grab the previously submerged chest. You may
have to re-enter the room to show the effects of the new temperature. Once you
have the chest, you can leave and switch back to Balmy Subtropical if you want.

You have a choice of going left or right here. The left side contains a key
that you'll need later on, so take the bridge to the left side. Before you
leave the room, there's a switch you can hit that will lower the drawbridge,
providing a shortcut back to the entrance.

[Key Room]
! Sun Shards
! Skylight
! Elemental Switch: Flame/Frost
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Blue Chest: Red Key
- Invisible Chest: Solar Fruit (on a manhole-like circle at the end of a small
- Barrel x2                     peninsula on the right side near the entrance)
~ Bat A x5
~ Blue Slime A x8
~ Chillin' A x9
~ Ice Ghoul x8

Lots of ice enemies in this room. There's also an elemental switch in the left
corner which raises the gate at the top when hit with a Flame-element attack.
Make sure to grab the Red Key from the chest there before returning to the
previous room and heading right.

[Cannon Room]
! Sun Shards
! Skylight
! Hint Panel: Locked Doors
! Red Key Door
- Green Chest: ADAMANT
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Fungus x3
~ Cannon A x2
~ Ghoul A x13
~ Popbud A x2
~ Spider x4
~ Yellow Slime A x7

A new enemy to watch out for here: Cannons. They're stationary but fire
powerful shots. The best way to deal with them is to attack them from an
unprotected side. If you need to cross in front of a cannon, do it quickly, and
have your shield ready. If your timing is good enough, you can even deflect the
shot back at the cannon to damage it.

Shoot the switch to lower a bridge between the two Cannons. Before you cross
over to the right side, grab the chest across from the first Cannon. On a thin
bridge between the two sides is a group of mushrooms that only fully bloom in
Balmy Subtropical conditions. These drop the rare Endurance Fruit.

Stop by the treasure room to the south before continuing north. There are some
Popbuds here. They fire spines in all directions when they die, so face them
and hold up your shield to avoid getting hit.

If you picked up the Red Key before coming here, use it on the door to proceed.

[Pump Room]
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Invisible Chest: Speed Fruit
- Jar x6

Don't miss the invisible chest in the middle of the four tanks.

[Southern Node]
! Skylight x2
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Invisible Chest: Clairvoyance Fruit (near bottom corner)
- Invisible Chest: Restorative (right corner of left quadrant)
~ Aero Ghoul A x2
~ Bat A x4
~ Blue Slime A x6
~ Petro Ghoul A x8
~ Pig A x8
~ Popbud A x1
~ Spider x2

There's an invisible chest to your immediate right as you enter the room. Break
the boxes and look north. See that switch? Shoot it to lower the bridge. In the
next section, there's an invisible chest in the right corner. Hitch a ride on
the moving platform. Be careful not to fall off (and be patient getting on),
because one misstep means instant Game Over and having to start over from the
beginning of the room. There's a room to the east with an accessible Solar
Station but the rest is blocked off for now.

[Charging Station]
! Solar Station
! Earth blocks blocking the rest of the area
- Green Chest:
  · Warrior's Ethic (first time)
  · Cure Bulb
- Fungus x2
~ Cannon B x4

[Central Nexus]
! Trap: Defeat all the monsters!
~ Lizardman A x2

These guys can be tough if you try to attack them head on. If you try to shoot
them from a distance they'll swing their ball and chains in quick circles and
reflect your shots back at you, and if you try to move in close you'll probably
get hit by the swing or returning ball. Instead, stand in front of one as it
twirls the ball. As soon as you see it reach back to hurl the projectile, put
up your shield. If you manage to Quick Guard the attack, you'll knock the ball
into the Lizardman's head, stunning it and allowing you to slice it up. It
might seem intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it they'll only
pose a problem in groups.

[Northern Node]
! Skylight x2
! Sun Shards x2
! Frost blocks blocking the path
! Flame block blocking the left exit
- Green Chest: MYTHRIL
- Chest: Antidote
- Chest: Earth Fruit
~ Aero Ghoul B x1
~ Bat B x4
~ Petro Ghoul B x2
~ Pig B x3
~ Pillar x2
~ Poisonin' x12

There are some Frost blocks in the way. Luckily you have the Flame terrennial,
so equip it and break through. You won't be able to get through the Flame block
on the left side for a while, but remember the location. You'll need to come
back to get one of Lucian's weapons.

[Sunken Room]
! Skylight
! Sun Shards x2
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Invisible Chest: Antidote (in top corner)
- Barrel x3
- Crate x3
- Nitro x5
~ Lizardman B x3
~ Poison Spider x6
~ Poisonin' x4

There are two platforms here that only float high enough for you to use them
when it's raining. You'll have to come back later with a climate or terrennial
that can cause rainfall.

! Sunken Platform (floats up during rainfall)
! Skylight
- Chest: Topaz
~ Blue Slime B x4
~ Chillin' B x4

! Sunken Platform (floats up during rainfall)
- Green Chest:
  · Muspell Arms (first time)
  · Elixir

[Platform Room]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Chest: Earth Fruit
~ Black Slime B x3
~ Blue Slime B x2
~ Cannon B x2
~ Ghoul B x7
~ !Ghoul B x7
~ Poisonin' x5
~ Popbud B x3
~ Yellow Slime B x3

More moving platforms. Take your time. While riding the second moving platform
you'll have an opportunity to shoot at some cannons on lone pillars in the
water. Take them out now and you won't have to deal with them on the platform
that crosses in front of them. The X button helps.

Between the second and third platforms there's an exit to another area. You
can't get through the area on the other side yet, so don't bother. Instead,
continue north.

[Green Room]
! Wind block blocking the entrance
! Solar Roots: grow across a gap at 75% humidity and above
- Green Chest:
  · Magic Bulb
  · Grass Dancer (Hard Mode, first time)

[Prep Room]
! Sun Crystal
! Solar Station

Heal up and head on in.

                   *--------------------------------------*
                   |Viscount Edgar & Viscountess Virginia |
                   *--------------------------------------*
                            Element: Cloud & Earth



Edgar is immune to Aaron's attacks and Virginia is immune to Lucian's. If you
have a favorite character you can choose him and only focus on one Poe, but
otherwise you'll be switching between them depending on who you're attacking.
They share the same lifebar, so you don't even have to hit the other one to
win, although they attack as a tag team so there will only be one of them on
screen at a time.

Edgar attacks using punches, and Virginia attacks with kicks. Keep moving and
let them charge past you, then hit them in the back when you hear the stunned
sound after their attacks. If you can't avoid an attack, block and you may be
able to avoid the damage. They're not too hard to take down, but they're not
done just yet...

                              *-----------------*
                              | Twin Poefighter |
                              *-----------------*
                                 Element: None

Their fused form alternates between both of their attacks, and is faster to
boot. Keep up the same strategy until it's down to about half health, at which
point it can start charging up energy. Don't get behind it or it will cancel
the attack and grab you for an extended combo. Stay in front of it until it
finishes charging, at which point you should run to either side and block. If
you stay in the middle the energy balls will arc and hit you from both sides
(they seek), so you need to be to one side to block both of them.

It's time to purify them. This time around, you have the use of both Toasty and
Ursula during the Shooting Battle segment. Toasty fires low-power but rapid-
fire and fast-moving bullets, and Ursula fires powerful missiles with splash
damage. Hold a trigger button to bring up the terrennial selection menu and use
the control pad to switch between them. For single regular orange enemies, Nero
is still the most efficient choice, but Ursula is better for groups and green
enemies that take multiple hits to kill. Toasty is good against bosses but
consumes energy rapidly.

If you see a blue enemy, quickly switch to Ursula and fire a missile that will
take it out in one hit. Use the trigger buttons if you're ever feeling
overwhelmed for some time to assess the situation.

During the asteroid segments, make sure to kill the enemies for recovery items.

Mid-boss: Don't bother shooting when its arms are closed, as it won't take any
damage. Toasty works well here. It will alternate between diving at you (move
out of the way!) and moving in an S-curve (keep out of its way!).

Heavy Schrödinger: Heavy means not very fast, so Ursula can be used here for
maximum efficiency when she's between movements. You should still follow the
same general strategy as the previous form - attack during the movement phase
and dodge during the machine gun phase - but this time she will be firing
missiles from the start and during both phases. This means that you need to
alternate between moving and firing off a missile during your attack phase. She
does have a slight pause after the machine gun phase in which you can get in an
attack, so take advantage of that.

Once it's over, finish off the twins and accept your TWO new terrennials and
climates.

===============================================================================

You now have access to a significant number of areas you couldn't
reach before, so it's time to do some backtracking before moving on with the
story. Don't worry, they'll still be waiting for you. When you do decide to
head to the train station, the Tropical Rainforest climate will unlock the
greatest number of paths.

[Entrance]

What are you waiting for? Head on in.

[Lobby]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Invisible Chest: Clairvoyance Fruit (top corner next to staircase)
- Crate x4
~ Clay Golem A x2
~ Lizardman A x2

If you can make it through the start of this dungeon without getting spotted,
the announcements over the loudspeaker will be slightly different. Not sure if
it actually affects anything other than that, though. I just fought my way
through.

This dungeon introduces the strong Clay Golem monsters. If they spot you
they'll curl up into a ball and roll at you. Quick Guard this attack to stun
them, or if you're strong enough, kill them before they can reach you. It helps
if they don't notice you before you start attacking.

Don't miss the invisible chest in the top corner next to the staircase.

[Ticket Counter]
! Sun Shards
- Hidden Chest: Earth Fruit
- Hidden Chest: Solar Fruit
- Barrel x2
- Crate x5
~ Clay Golem A x6

There are two chests in this room that you can't see from the camera angle. On
the top wall of the area there are two sections that jut out into the room
(they look a bit like information booths). The right side of each booth is
fully visible but the left side is obscured from your perspective; the chests
are each located in one of those hidden corners.

Head south to a small room with two divided cells. This is probably the area
the prisoners escaped from. Just missed them!

[Holding Cells]
! Sun Shards
- Green Chest:
  · Cure Bulb
  · Sound Data DEMO 3 (Hard Mode, first time)
- Invisible Chest: Stealth Fruit (under Sun Shards)
~ Aero Ghoul x2
~ Petro Ghoul x4
~ Purple Slime A x3

Watch out for Ghouls to spawn as you're leaving a cell. Once you've cleared out
the place, return to Ticket Counter and head north this time.

[Southeast Terminal]
! Sun Shards
- Invisible Chest: Restorative
- Jar x2
~ Clay Golem A x2
~ Lizardman A x3

Grab the invisible chest in the alcove formed by the boxes dividing the room.
The door to the next terminal is gated shut. Looks like you'll be going the
long way around...

[Staircase 1 South]

Nothing to do here. Take the stairs.

[Platform 1]
! Skylight x2
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Luggage x4
~ Clay Golem A x1
~ Ghost A x4
~ Lizardman A x2

Watch out for the Ghosts in this room. If they manage to touch you they'll nab
one of your items and run off with it. Use R-targeting to lock on even when
they're invisible.

[Staircase 1 North]

Looks like somebody made a mess of the place. Move forward.

[Northeast Terminal]
! Trap: Defeat all the monsters!
~ Lizardman A x3

Story event. Collect the Ninja and keep moving.

[Staircase 2 North]
! Solar Station

Recharge your energy if you want, then head downstairs again.

[Platform 2]
! Skylight x2
! Sun Shards
! Cloud blocks
! Flame blocks
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud
- Luggage x3
~ Green Slime x4
~ Orc x4
~ Purple Slime B x5

At the end of this room, hit the switch with an Earth attack to lower the
spikes. Stop by the open train car on your way there.

[Open Train 2 Car]
- Chest: random Ryuusei item (after completing crossover quest in JP version)
- Chest: Emerald
- Luggage x4

Goodies. In the Tropical Rainforest climate, Luggage piles turns into single
packages which drop very expensive items that you can sell for Junk Part
purchasing funds.

Return to the platform and continue on to the stairs.

[Staircase 2 South]

Nothing to do here. Head out the door.

[Southeast Terminal]
~ Purple Slime A x7

Walk up next to the spikes and look left. See that switch? Shoot it to lower
the spikes and continue to the next room.

[Staircase 3 South]

You know the drill.

[Platform 3]
! Skylight x2
- Luggage x3
~ Ghost B x7
~ Ghoul x4
~ Green Slime x5
~ Hot Ghoul x4
~ Pork Cannon x6
~ Purple Slime B x2

Stop by the train car on the way through.

[Open Train 3 Car]
- Green Chest:
  · Dried Meat
  · Sound Data DEMO 4 (Hard Mode, first time)
- Luggage x4

More goodies!

[Staircase 3 North]

Keep on movin'.

[Northwest Terminal]
~ Clay Golem B x2
~ Toadstool x1

! Solar Roots: grow across a gap at 75% humidity and above
- Chest: IRON
- Chest: IRON
- Chest: STEEL
- Chest: STEEL

Shoot the Toadstool from a distance to avoid getting poisoned. Grab the Junk
Parts if it's humid enough for the plants to grow across the gaps, then keep
going.

[Staircase 4 North]

Staaaairwaaaaay....

[Platform 4]
! Sneaking section
! Skylight x2
- Chest: Healing Potion
- Chest: Solar Fruit
~ Spotter x7

Time for another sneaking sequence. This, too, is optional, as if you're strong
enough you can just kill the Spotter robots when they try to apprehend you (but
be warned, if the alert timer hits zero, it's an instant Game Over). If you get
seen, try to hide behind a pillar and wait for the cooldown timer to run out.
There are other Spotters later on in the game, but make sure you kill at least
one of them to get the Enemy list entry. If you're going for stealth, stick to
the center and weave in between the rows when a Spotter comes by. If you make
it to the switch without getting seen, hit it to end the stealth segment.

[Staircase 4 South]

Story event. Stairs.

[Southwest Terminal]
! Earth blocks
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud
- Chest: Solar Fruit
~ Skeleton Archer x6
~ Spider x4

Finally, on the other side of that gate. Break through the Earth blocks with a
Cloud attack and get ready for a lot of enemies to appear. These Skeleton
Archers draw back the bow before loosing an arrow at you. Quick Guard to
deflect the arrow at an enemy, and with the Red Cross shield you can even heal
yourself in the process. Hit the regular switch to raise the gate, then hit the
Earth switch with a Cloud attack to activate the moving platform on the other
side of the room. Don't bother with the lower room yet, as it's blocked from
the other side.

! Ice Switch
! Cloud block blocking the door to Storage Room
- Crate x2
~ Orc x9

The platform will take you straight across the pit to the other side. If you
want to access the room to the south, you'll need to shoot the Ice Switch
halfway through the ride with a Flame attack to activate the other platform.

Either way, once you make it to the other side a ton of Orcs will spawn. If
you're not prepared for a close-quarters battle, just flip the switch and
escape to the upper room.

[Back Room]
! Flame blocks blocking the entrance
! Sunken Platform (floats up during rainfall)
- Green Chest: 
  · Nidhoggr Arms (first time)
  · Garnet

[Storage Room]
! Sun Shards
! Solar Roots: grow across a gap at 75% humidity and above
- Green Chest:
  · Battle Suit (first time)
  · Magic Bulb
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Chest: Solar Fruit
~ Ghost B x3
~ Spider x3

[Staircase 5 South]

Finally, the last empty staircase room in the station.

[Prep Room]
! Sun Crystal
! Solar Station

Story event. Looks like you'll have to fight the Duke atop his castle. You
won't be able to return to town until you've finished the next dungeon, so now
is the time to return and make any necessary preparations. Assuming you opened
the gate between the two southern terminals, it will be a much shorter trip
back to the boss room when you return. When you're ready, step forward into the
boss room.

[Boss Room]
~ Lizardman B x3

You have one minute to finish off the three Lizardmen. Try not to let them
surround you. If you've been practicing the Quick Guard technique you should be
able to take them out one by one well within the time limit.

[Back Railing]

Not so much a room as the railing on the back of the train. Better get going.

[Dining Car]
- Green Chest: GUNPOWDER
- Invisible Chest: Magic Drop
- Invisible Chest: Cure Drop

Thankfully the game doesn't leave you completely without supplies. There's a
Traveling Merchant in here with a well-stocked inventory. You can also press A
at a table to refill your Life. It even revives dead characters, so this is an
excellent place to visit if you need some healing between dungeons. Don't miss
the invisible chests in the corner behind the merchant and inside the bend in
the counter.

[Passenger Car A]
! Trap: Defeat all the monsters!
~ Orc A x4
~ Petro Ghoul x4

Clear the room and move on.

[Passenger Car B]
! Trap: Defeat all the monsters!

~ Ghoul A x7
~ Petro Ghoul x5

Clear the room and move on.

[Passenger Car C]
! Trap: Defeat all the monsters!
! Sun Shards
~ Skeleton Fencer A x6

New enemy here: Skeleton Fencers. These things are very fast, so if you're
trying to guard their attacks, do it as soon as or even before you see them
draw back or you'll get sliced. They've got a sword thrust counterattack if you
don't finish them off in one combo, so watch out for that too. The easiest
strategy is to take them out from a distance with Aaron.

[Boxcar]
! Sun Shards
- Box x2
- Crate x2

The door north is locked, but you can come back after clearing the stage and it
will be open. For now, ride the lift outside.

Time to face... a giant enemy crab?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

                               *--------------*
                               | Baron Stoker |
                               *--------------*
                                Element: Frost

His pattern is actually pretty easy. He's weak to Flame, but most of the time
his claws are covering his vulnerable body. When he lifts one claw to attack,
it's your job to attack the other one with the opposite element (hit the Dark
claw with Toasty and the Sol claw with Nero) and he will raise it as well.
Once both claws are out of the way you can attack his weak point for massive
damage. If you've been upgrading the Ninja it works very well here.

His attacks consist mostly of slow-moving Sol and Dark flamethrowers (depending
on which claw is raised). If you get too far away he will fire missiles, which
you can dodge by weaving back and forth or standing in the corner next to him.

After losing 50% of his lifebar he'll start using a Frost beam attack. The
beams will freeze you if you get hit, but you can guard them. Afterwards he
will charge at you. It's a certain Guard Break if you block, but at least you
won't take any damage. Run back to the entrance of the area to completely avoid
it, or run to one of the sides. As long as you aren't touching his claws you'll
be pushed back without getting hurt.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Time to purify Stoker. This round will be a test of your ability to quickly
react to different enemy patterns. Use Nero on single enemies, Ursula on close
groups or blue/purple enemies, and Alexander on lines. Use Tove as a shield if
you're overwhelmed and about to be hit by the fast-moving missiles.

Ursula still works very well on the Bomber mid-boss. Just move slightly after
it starts firing to avoid getting hit.

Ursula works well on the puncher too, but stay out of the middle since it has
a new diving attack. If you see it fly straight offscreen in a particular
direction, it will come flying back across the screen in the opposite direction
immediately afterwards.

Armored Schrödinger: Use the same strategy against the rapid lasers. If she
reels back for a kick, move to the top of the screen. If the wings fly off and
attach to the front and she begins charging for a powerful laser attack, hit
each one with an Ursula to knock it off and render her vulnerable again.

And with that, you now have the last terrennial and climate! On top of that,
you get the Dragoon gun from Ernest.

[Entrance]
! Citizen: Smirking Man
- Crate x2
~ Green Slime A x2
~ Hot Dog A x2
~ Purple Slime A x1
~ Skeleton Archer A x4

Hot Dog = pain. Try to sneak up on it with a Frost attack to avoid the Flame
breath. Stop by the room to the right if the temperature is below freezing,
otherwise head up.

[Acid Pool]
! Toxic Sludge: freezes over at temperatures below 32ºF (0ºC)
- Green Chest:
  · Garmr Arms (first time)
  · Miracle Ice Pop
- Chest: Healing Potion

[Concourse]
! Sun Shards
- Crate x2
- Jar x2
~ !Yellow Slime x4
~ Vampire Bat x3
~ !Vorn A x4

Lots of choices here. If it's windy, head left. Head down using the other exit
to meet an important character. Head right once you're done exploring. We'll
end up in the room up from this one shortly, so no need to visit it yet.

[Entrance] (side area)
! Citizen: Hollow-Eyed Man
- Chest: Earth Fruit

Remember this guy; you'll need to find him again soon for a story mission.

[Glider Room]
! Glider: lets you cross a gap at wind speeds above 13.4 mph (6 m/s)
- Barrel x2
~ !Vorn A x8

If it's windy use the glider and grab the chest. You can also hit a switch in
the next area to lower some spikes. Otherwise, this isn't a bad room to use for
leveling.

[Long Corridor] (left side)
- Green Chest: CRYSTAL
~ Hot Dog A x2

Hit the switch here to lower the spikes in the middle of this room.

[Spike Room]
! Weight Switch
! Hint Panel: Weight Switches
- Green Chest:
  · Snake Eyes (first time)
  · Dark Card
- Lamp x1
~ Skeleton Fencer A x4
~ Stone Golem x1

Stand on the pressure switch and whistle, then wait for the Stone Golem to
start rolling. Run around the opposite side of the wall from it so that it
doesn't see you, then run across the spikes to the chest. The switch will lower
the spikes permanently.

[Block Room]
! Sun Shards
! Flame blocks
! Cloud blocks
! Earth blocks
! Frost blocks
- Barrel x3
~ Mine x4
~ Pig A x16

! Solar Roots: grow across a gap at 75% humidity and above
- Lamp x1
~ Vorn A x1

In high humidity the roots will create a shortcut to Long Corridor. Head right
for a junk part, then north to progress.

[Cannon Room]
- Green Chest: CONVERTOR
- Invisible Chest: MYTHRIL
- Invisible Chest: ADAMANT
~ Cannon A x2
~ Pork Cannon x2
~ Pork Cannon Mk. II x2

You'd best use Bomber here to hit the Pork Cannon Mk. IIs from the side.

Don't miss the invisible chests behind the Pork Cannon Mk. IIs.

[Rest Area]
! Citizen: Level-Headed Woman
! Solar Station

The woman here will give you a quest to bring an item to the man in small area
set off from the main section of Entrance. You'll have to do it in order to get
past the gatekeeper ahead, so go take care of that.

There's also a space for a lift to the Fountain here, but you'll be activating
it from the other side. It's a nice shortcut on a revisit, though.

[Long Corridor]
! Citizen: Dangerous Woman
- Chest: Magic Potion
- Invisible Chest: Earth Fruit (far left wall)
- Jar x2
~ Cannon A x2
~ Green Slime A x4
~ Ice Dog A x2
~ !Vorn A x9

You may want to change the climate to Arid Desert before continuing in order to
unlock a shortcut later on.

If you lowered the spikes from the Glider Room, head down the middle for easy
access. Otherwise, have your shield ready to parry the Cannon attacks as you
move up one of the outer rows.

[Lower Gate]
! Citizen: Fearless/Daring Gatekeeper

If you haven't completed the Level-Headed Woman's mission he won't have
anything to do with you. Otherwise he'll let you through if you can manage to
retrieve a spare bottlecap from the warehouse without getting spotted.

[Warehouse]
! Mission: Get the spare bottlecap without being discovered!
~ Stone Golem x3

You cannot get caught here or it's instant Game Over. Use a Stealth Fruit if
you don't want to bother. When you get near the top left corner, whistle to
pull the guard away and move around the opposite side of the wall. Grab the
chest and the mission ends immediately.

[Rooftops West]

Story event. Keep going.

[Rooftops East]
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud
- Chest: Magic Potion
- Lamp x3
~ Cannon B x2
~ Skeleton Fencer B x1

This area can be a bit tricky. If you want to be as safe as possible, take out
the cannons by deflecting their shots back to them. You could also use Witch,
but don't forget to guard if they fire as you move in front of them. If you
just want to get through as fast as possible, guard as you move past the
cannons then quickly turn around and fire a Cloud shot at the switch before
turning to guard again. Once you hit the switch the platform will make a second
trip (to the exit) after its first one (to the treasure).

[The Fountain]
- Chest: Healing Potion
~ Hot Dog B x1
~ Ice Dog B x1
~ Urchin x2

If the temperature is high enough you'll have access to the lower half of the
room. Head right to continue.

! Flooded Path: dries up at temperatures above 86ºF (30ºC)
! Sun Shards
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud (lowers spikes in this room)
! Elemental Switch: Flame/Frost (activates shortcut to Rest Area)

~ Green Slime B x3
~ Purple Slime B x3

[Upper Gate]
! Weight Switch
! Hint Panel: Weight Switches
- Crate x2
~ Stone Golem B x2

You know the drill. Stand on the weight switch and whistle, then wait by the
door for the Stone Golem to step on it.

[Storage Area]
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Invisible Chest: Ruby
- Chest: random Ryuusei item (after completing crossover quest in JP version)
- Barrel x4
- Lamp x6

Treasure room! Don't miss the invisible chest next to the visible one.

You're not far from the Duke now. The tower has a lot of floors, though, so it
will take plenty of work to get to the top.

----------[ Auguste 1F ]----------

The first floor is divided into four sections, one for each element. Each
section is blocked off by the weather obstacle that corresponds to its
affinity, so you're forced to fight each section's enemies when they're powered
up by their element (unless you use a burst after you get through).

[Entrance Hall]
! Skylight x4

Story event. Not much to do here but charge up your energy.

[Climate Trial]

There are four pedastals here, each corresponding to a particular climate. You
don't need to do these in any particular order, and the switches will stay
activated if you leave the castle, so feel free to go change the climate after
each section. At the end of each segment is an elemental orb which you must
activate, and a teleporter which will bring you back to the main passage.
I'm going to cover the sections in clockwise order, starting with Flame in the
southwest.

Set your climate to Arid Desert. If the temperature's below 86ºF or (30ºC),
wait until daybreak and use a Burst attack with Ursula. It needs to be hot for
you to get through the next room. Bring a couple Clairvoyance Fruit if you want
an easier time.

[Arid Gate]
! Flooded Path: dries up at temperatures above 86ºF (30ºC)
! Weight Switch
- Barrel x2
~ Hot Dog x1

Run over and stand on the weight switch without the Hot Dog seeing you. Whistle
(blow into the microphone), then run to the gate. The Hot Dog should hear your
whistle and run over to the switch, opening the gate.

[Desert Corridor]
~ Hot Ghoul x4
~ Red Slime x6

Watch out for the trapdoors in this room. You can make it through without any
trouble by running straight forward without stopping. Do fall through at least
once to grab the treasure below, though.

[Sand Pit]
- Green Chest:
  · Battle Boots (first time)
  · Wild Card
- Amber x2
- Jar x2
~ Hot Vorn x6
~ Red Slime x6

This room isn't incredibly large for the number of enemies down here, so get
out quickly if you're not prepared to fight.

[Trapdoor Trial]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Healing Potion
- Invisible Chest: Earth Fruit (far right corner near door)
- Invisible Chest: Solar Fruit (far right corner near door)
~ Burnin' x4
~ Hot Dog x4

Trapdoors here too. The elemental orb can actually only be reached by falling
through one, so either use a Clairvoyance Fruit to find the one closest to the
door, or (starting from the door) travel along the left wall until you fall in.

[Lower Chamber]
- Chest: Magic Potion
~ Hot Dog x4
~ Red Slime x7
! Sun Shards

If you fell through the right trapdoor you should be able to reach the orb from
your landing spot. Hit it with a Frost attack and teleport out.

[Tropical Gate]
! Gas Jets
! Hint Panel: Gas Jets
! Solar Roots: grow across a gap at 75% humidity and above

It needs to be humid enough for the roots to grow, putting you in reach of both
the gate and the switch to open it. Try not to get hit by the poisonous jets
(they can be blocked with your shield).

If you don't like floating platforms, this section is gonna be torture.

[Rainforest Corridor]
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud x3
~ Popbud x4

Pretty simple at first; take the platforms one at a time and be patient. When
you get to the area with the Popbuds, be careful with your aim. You want all
the switches to be set to Cloud. If you happen to hit a Popbud by mistake, just
face it and keep your shield up to avoid getting knocked off the platform.

[Platform Trial]
! Sun Shards
- Amber x1
- Crate x2
~ Arsenal x4
~ Cannon x5

Let 'er rip with Ninja or Witch if you're feeling lucky. If you happen to get
hit you'll just have to start the room over. I find it's easiest to get through
by using X to look ahead and take things out before you move into their range.

When you reach the center, hit the orb with a Cloud attack and teleport out.

Be careful here; there are enemies that hide in the walls. Make sure you use
R-targeting to find them and approach cautiously from the side to lure them
out. You'll need it to be freezing in order to reach the switch that opens the
gate.

[Arctic Corridor]
! Hint Panel: Slippery Floors
! Sun Shards
- Snow x4

You'll already be familiar with icy floors if you did the Istrakan sidequest.
Before you step off onto one, look to the other side to make sure you're not
sliding into trouble.

[Ice Trial]
! Frost block x5
- Green Chest:
  · Warrior's Ethic (first time)
  · Endurance Fruit
- Invisible Chest: Delicious Meat

You need to step on the switch in the middle to open the gate, then make your
way through it to the elemental orb. There's a nice map with instructions made
by omegadestroyer7, which can be found here:
http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a362/omegadestroyer7/LunarKnightsMap.jpg

In case it doesn't show up, I'll give step-by-step directions. From the
entrance, move right two squares so that you are at the far right corner of the
non-icy area. This is the point from which you will enter the icy floor. Move
DR, UR, DR, DL. You should now be next to two blocks. Destroy the first one,
then move DL, UL. You should be between two blocks. Destroy the right one to
open the area with the switch. Step on it, then head DL, U to return to the
non-icy area. Get in position at the far right again. Move DR, DL, R, DL, DR.
If you did it right you'll now be in front of the elemental orb.

If the wind speed is high enough you can cross the gap with the Glider. You
also might want to bring a couple of Elixirs, as Confusion can be deadly here.

[Continental Corridor]
- Chest: Healing Potion
~ Grenade Cannon x3
~ Urchin x3

It's very windy here, and you'll get pushed in different directions depending
on where you're standing. Get used to it now, because it's going to get worse.

[Wind Trial]

Now there are sections of wall missing. If you get blown off the path it's Game
Over and you'll have to start the room over again. I found it easiest to just
run through and try to react quickly when the wind changes.

At least the area around the elemental orb is safe. Hit it with an Earth attack
and teleport out.

It's pretty similar to the other chimeras you've fought, except that it can
switch elements between Flame and Frost. In its Flame form it shoots fireballs
and in its Frost form it breathes icy breath, but other than that the forms are
basically identical. It pounces, and its tail spits poison or bites. The poison
can be deflected back but the fireballs can't. After a few attacks it will sit
down and spit a series of projectiles (meteors or ice crystals) straight up.
They'll fall down on your current position, so keep moving. After using this
attack it switches elements. As with the other chimeras, combos will stun it.

After losing 50% of its health it will be able to pounce twice in a row.

[Element Trial]

After going through each of the climates you're probably sick of the elements.
Well, too bad, because the second floor consists of three segments that each
deal with an opposing pair of elements. There are no climate requirements for
these so pick whichever one you like. I'll cover the rooms from left to right.

In this room, whenever you change a switch to a particular element, all of the
blocks of that element will respawn. You can use this to your advantage by
blocking the Urchins on the other side.

If you need specific directions: start by destroying the first block, then hit
the switch. Destroy the next block to release the Urchin, then hit the switch
again when the Urchin is at the top of the screen to respawn the block and trap
it. Continue to the next row. Hit the switch, then destroy both blocks at the
same time. Hit the switch again when the Urchins are at the bottom of their
path to trap them. Then you can destroy the final block and grab the chest at
leisure.

[Sneaking Trial]
! Sun Shards
! Blue Chest: Yellow Key
~ Serpent Statue x3
~ Spotter x3

You can choose from two paths here. The lower path contains flame jets and
Spotter robots, and the upper path contains Serpent Statues and icy floors. The
switch is in the bottom corner, so pick your preferred path and make your way
there. If you missed getting the enemy list entry for Spotter back in Santa
Cecilia Station, you may want to kill one here. Make sure to grab the key from
the chest before leaving or you'll have to do this whole section over again.

[Flame/Frost Room]

Hit the orb with either element and teleport out.

Make your way through to the main area for this section.

[Red Room]
! Red Key Door
~ Librarian x3
~ Skeleton x8

The orb is nearby but it's blocked by a locked door, so you'll have to go
through a few rooms to find the key.

! Elemental Switch: Sol/Dark
- Blue Chest: Red Key

~ Wraith x3

Careful with these Wraiths - if they latch on to you they'll drain your energy
pretty quickly. Don't stop when you reach the exit - you need to keep exploring
the rest of the maze to find the key you need.

through a few rooms to find the key.

[Pillar Trial]
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud
- Green Chest: GENERATOR

Shoot the elemental switch in the middle when you pass by it as you make your
way clockwise to the exit. It will change which group of Pillars are stopped.

[Spike Trial]
! Elemental Switch: Earth/Cloud
! Blue Chest: Blue Key
~ Spotter x3

Another sneaking section here. The elemental switches will toggle the spikes in
the floor, so hit one whenever your progress is blocked as you make your way up
to the switch that ends the sneaking section. Grab the key before you leave.

[Earth/Cloud Room]

Hit the orb with either element and teleport out.

Use the same strategy as with the Dragon Chimera, but don't stand next to it
unless it's already in the middle of an attack. It can grab you with its hair
and damage you repeatedly. The Cloud/Earth projectiles it spits can be
deflected back at it with a Quick Guard. Once it gets below 50% HP it can fire
three projectiles in quick succession.

Only one way you can go at the moment, and that's east.

[Partner Trial]
! Mission: Get on both weighted switches at the same time!

This puzzle isn't too tough. Hitting a switch will toggle platforms up or down,
and each switch can only be used once. You have to get both characters to the
weight switches at the end. If you mess up, just call Alice on the Mobile Unit
and Retry. Use Select to switch between characters and A to activate switches.

At first there's only one thing you can do - have Lucian hit the switch near
him. After doing so, make your way to the area with two switches next to each
other. Don't touch them yet. Switch to Aaron and have him walk across the newly
raised platform to the next switch, which he should hit to raise another
platform. Cross that platform, then have Lucian hit one of his switches to
raise a third platform for Aaron. Have him cross it, then when he hits another
dead end in the middle of the room, have Lucian hit the other switch. Aaron can
then cross over to the other side of the room and another switch. Once he hits
that switch he can make it to one of the pressure pads. Lucian then just has to
head to the top of the room, hit the final switch, and cross over to his own
pressure pad. With both pads activated, the platforms will disappear and two
new ones will appear in the rooms with Solar Stations.

                                Element:  Dark

The snake tail spits gobs of poison. You can knock them away by guarding, but
the chimera won't be affected. It will growl when it's preparing to charge.
Don't try to guard its charge, as it'll just knock you over. It's pretty fast,
so you may want to actually run out of the way. Don't get too close unless it's
already in the middle of attacking, or you could be hit by its poison breath
attack.

Don't use Nero, as it's strong against Dark. There also aren't any poles here
for it to ram into. You can get a lot of hits in while it's stunned or using
its poison breath attack, and you can try to get some in between its other
attacks but that's more risky.

When its health gets below 50% it can pounce twice in a row.

                                 Element:  Sol

It wanders around leaping and firing Sol Shots most of the time. Try to stay
out of its direct line of fire and you should be able to dodge most of those.
Besides, they can't be deflected back at it.

If you get close to it, it may rear back and start glowing. That's your cue
that it's going to bite. If you manage to Quick Guard the lunge you'll stun
it, so try that if you're daring. Otherwise, move to the side and get a combo
in. You could just block and let your guard counter soak up the hit, but don't
just stand there or it will bite you and start absorbing your Life.
When its tail grows four spikes and glows red it's about to swing in a
large circle, so get your guard up. If it glows red with a single spike it will
stab out in one direction. If you hit it right after an attack you should
always be able to get a full combo in, and maybe another one while it hunches
over afterwards if you're quick.

During the first half he mostly uses Blood Cutter, which can be deflected back
at him with a Quick Guard. Kinda makes you feel like you're in a Zelda game,
huh? Keep your distance. His close-range spinning attack Lunar Flare can eat
right through your guard and stun you, but it's great for healing when using
the Red Cross shield. If he starts to gather energy in a colored aura, hit it
with the opposite element or get ready for a world of pain - Nightmare can't be
blocked, but keep running and hopefully you can dodge it. The Blood Company
attack, in which he turns into a swarm of bats, can be countered pretty well
with Dragoon or Hel early on, but you may want to run in circles around the
stage's perimeter once you can no longer outrun them. He uses stronger attacks
more often as his HP dwindles and moves faster, so you might want to save your
Trance for the second half of the battle. You'll have to engage in a struggle
if you attack him in Trance mode, though, and Bursts will only get one hit in
before he escapes in bat form, so don't rely on it.

More story here, and I'm not going to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that
it's not over until you defeat the Immortal, Polidori.

===============================================================================

Just one place left to go. You can't save or use the Mobile Unit in here, so
finish anything you have left to do. This is the final battle!

The dungeon is made up almost entirely of Trap rooms, so be prepared.

Keep your distance. He has several different attack patterns. One is to lob
Slimes at you - just parry them back at him for solid damage. Another is to
send out spikes that follow you - just keep moving (if necessary, running) and
that one's not too difficult. If he slowly homes in on your position, stay away
from the shadow, as he'll crush you for massive damage. Not an extremely
difficult fight if you're careful. He also has the ability to summon images of
the bosses you've fought so far to perform their characteristic attacks. They
can't be hurt, so just dodge.

You've managed to destroy Polidori's corporeal body, but they're called
Immortals for a good reason. At this point Polidori takes the fight to space.
There are three phases, and later phases tend to focus on more complex attacks.
The first attack is a series of concentric rings. Just keep in the center of
the rings to avoid taking damage. In the second attack, Polidori opens his arms
and begins charging lasers in a clockwise manner. Finally, for his third attack
he summons 3-4 swarms of meteors to throw at you.

Toasty is probably the most effective, but it eats through energy quickly if
you're not careful, so I prefer to use Ursula for the entire battle. Fire
missiles whenever he's not attacking and whenever you have a chance during the
concentric circles. When he opens up to start charging the lasers, fire a
missile at each one as soon as it starts charging and it should stop. When he
starts drawing summoning circles for the meteor attack you can still damage him
by firing missiles where his eye is normally located. You can also get in a
couple of shots between meteor strikes, but keep moving when they're flying at
you.

After the three forms, Alice will interrupt and suggest that you attack his
core. For this "battle" you're limited to Nero, so just hold your stylus over
him and you'll emerge victorious.

Congratulations, you beat the game. After the credits you can choose a save
slot for your clear data, which you can then load to start a New Game+. Some
accessories can only be obtained on Hard Mode, but enemy levels are increased,
so choose your difficulty accordingly. You can also choose to reset your stats
and levels. You keep everything else, though, even your terrennials and
climates. You won't get back any Warrior's Ethics you used, though, so don't
reset your levels if you care about the stat bonuses.

You also now have access to Boss Rush and new Shooting Battle stages in
Sheridan's mansion. Other than that, the game will progress normally, except
for one area...

Start a New Game+ using your clear data. As soon as you have both characters
(at the beginning of Chapter 3), a new dungeon will appear at the top right of
the map.

-----------------------[ Vambery, the Tower Laboratory ]-----------------------

This tower consists of 100 floors, with enemy levels on each floor equal to
that floor's number. The tower itself is divided into 10 segments, each with 10
floors. At the end of each segment is a boss battle, then you are taken to the
treasure room to claim your reward. There is a different reward for each
segment, one green chest and one orange chest:
 1 -  10: Training Boots, METEORITE
11 -  20: Sound Data BATTLE 1, LUNASTEEL
21 -  30: Cursed Boots, METEORITE
31 -  40: Sound Data BATTLE 2, LUNASTEEL
41 -  50: Cursed Scarf, FANG
51 -  60: Sound Data BATTLE 3, GENERATOR
61 -  70: Cursed Mask, FANG
71 -  80: Sound Data SHOOTING BATTLE, GENERATOR
81 -  90: Eclipse Eye, Endurance Fruit
91 - 100: Eclipse Goggles, Resurrective

You can't save or use the Mobile Unit in here, so make whatever preparations
you need in order to get through 10 floors in a row. I recommend using the
Frigid Arctic climate, since it disables flame traps and has low wind speeds
most of the time.

Once you unlock more floors hint panels will appear that allow you to change
the destination of the teleporter. For now, step on the teleporter to be taken

Spiked balls drop from the ceiling, cutting off the path behind you and forcing

from the Evil Eye attacks. You can also hug the wall to slip by their shots, or
use the Bomber to take them out from an adjacent hallway. Note that you can run
right past the Lizardmen and they'll most likely end up getting killed by the
spiked balls anyway. It may not be an issue now, but the drops speed up on
higher floors.

  There are a couple areas of the game which are never visited during the
  story, but which nonetheless hold some important items. These side-areas
  will be mentioned in the main walkthrough as they become available, but
  their own walkthrough sections are here.

  This section will also contain advice for the extra content aside from the
  main story.

Return to Hunting Mansion: Interior and enter the room above the boss room. You
may want to bring along a Clairvoyance fruit for one particular room, or at
least hold onto the one you get at the start.

These are the ruins that the Margrave was excavating before you offed him. It's
the least you can do to finish his work, right?

you to a chest.

[Bridge Room]

[Abandoned Passage]

There's another walkway on the other side of the room with a Green Chest, but
you can't reach it from here.

[Blocked Gate]
! Sun Shards x2
! Skylight x2
! Elemental Switch: Flame/Frost x3
- Green Chest:
  · Ice Flame Amulet (first time)
  · LEATHER
- Chest: Solar Fruit
- Crate x5
~ Cannon x3
~ Chillin' x8
~ Ghoul x11
~ Poison Spider x4

Head down and right to reach that chest you saw in the previous room. Back in
this room you'll need to cross a pipe to continue, but be careful not to fall
off or it's Game Over.

There are some elemental switches at the bottom that you need to mess with to
continue, and the only way to reach them is via floating platforms, which in
turn are targeted by Cannons. You can go around the back of the Cannons to a
skylight and fire off a few Witch or Bomber shots to take care of the Cannons
while you're at it.

Hit the switches with a shot of the opposite element to change them. First
turn them all to Flame to spawn a Green Chest, then all to Frost to open the
door.

[Abandoned Passage]
- Green Chest: THROTTLE
~ Ghoul x1

Only one Ghoul guarding the chest. Shouldn't be a problem.

[Conveyor Room]
! Skylight x2
! Sun Shards
- Green Chest: LENS
- Chest: Earth Fruit
- Jar x2
~ Cannon x2
~ Chillin' x4
~ !Ghoul x15
~ Poison Spider x2

The switch at the top raises the gate to a treasure room. Again, use Witch or
bomber to hit the cannons from the side.

[Dark Room]
! Dark Area
! Sun Shards
! Elemental Switch: Sol/Dark
~ Ghost x4

Hit the switch to make your journey through the other side of this room a lot
easier. When you get back to the Conveyor Room, take either platform (it's
really the same one going back and forth between the two docks), then transfer
to another one halfway through. Follow the path around to the exit, which takes
you to the other half of the Dark Room.

- Barrel x2
- Crate x2
- Jar x2
~ Chillin' x7
~ Lizardman x3

Be careful of the two Lizardmen on the pipe. If you don't parry their attacks
properly you could easily get knocked off. Throw the switch on the left to
activate a moving platform shortcut. Take the right exit before the left one.

[Remote Corridor]
- Green Chest:
  · Gold Nugget
  · Warrior's Ethic (Hard Mode, first time)

This is just a tiny peninsula. Grab the chest and head back around to the room
proper.

- Invisible Chest: Restorative (at the very top)

Don't miss the invisible chest near the exit.

[Excavation Lift]

Step on the lift to proceed into the icy Sealed Area.

---------------------------[ Istrakan: Sealed Area ]---------------------------

Since the last one was fire, looks like it's time for an ice dungeon.

[West Room]
! Sun Shards

- Chest: Healing Potion
- Chest: Magic Potion
- Invisible Chest: Magical Drink (at the top, in the alcove by the switch)
~ Cannon x7
~ Pig x6
~ Pork x5

Whenever you step on an icy floor, you'll continue sliding until you hit a wall
or a normal floor. Plan ahead accordingly.

There's a switch near the top that you need to hit to open the gate to the next
area. You won't be able to approach it, so just shoot it as you slide by.

You can see a green chest on a ledge, but you can't reach it from down here, so
just head through the gate you opened.

[Center Room]
! Sun Shards
- Green Chest:
  · Midnight Sun Fruit
  · Warrior's Ethic (first time on Nightmare Mode)
- Chest: Healing Potion
- Invisible Chest: Delicious Meat (on a platform next to the Healing Potion
~ Cannon x3        chest)
~ Hound x1
~ Pig x3

Make your way through to the next area. Half of the room is cut off, but we'll
get there shortly.

[East Room]
! Sun Shards
- Chest: Healing Potion
~ Cannon x6
~ Ice Dog x1
~ Lizardman x2
~ Orc x1

Keep going until you wrap around to the other side of the Center Room.

[Center Room]
- Invisible Chest: Jasper (in alcove near lower door to the East Room)
~ Cannon x4
~ Pig x4

Keep right and head up the large staircase to reach a smaller room.

[Altar of Frost]
- Green Chest:
  · Dark Scythe Hel (first time)
  · Broken Dark Gun

Grab your new weapon, then head back to the Center Room to explore the only
other path.

[West Room]
- Green Chest:
  · Cool Bandanna (first time)
  · Heaven Fruit
~ Orc x1

Finally, it's the chest that you saw when you first entered this area. Either
make the long trek back out or use your Mobile Unit to get a lift from Alice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  After beating the game, a new option will become available at Sheridan's
  Mansion. Boss Battle allows you to test your skills in a timed battle
  against the game's bosses. You can choose a particular boss to fight it,
  or ALL to fight every boss in a row without any breaks. You can use the
  other modes to practice, but this is the one that nets you the good
  rewards.

  At first, only the Gold difficulty is selectable, but Platinum becomes
  available once you beat ALL mode with both characters. Since you can only
  use one character at a time, it's best to wait until the time of day when
  your character of choice can charge energy before attempting this.

  For general strategies against the bosses, check their respective
  sections in the walkthrough. This will just cover extended strategies.

           (note that there are special one-time rewards for

[Rymer]

  The pillars block the regular bolts, but be careful to get out of the way
  if he fires grenades or flaming bolts. Set the climate to Frigid Arctic to
  strengthen your attacks.

  Lucian: Equip Ezra and Hel. Use your spin attack to hit him multiple
  times. The trails from his charging attack can damage you, so wait until he
  stops or attack from the side instead of chasing him.

  Aaron: Equip Ezra and Witch. Stand behind a pillar and fire Witch sideways
  so that it has a straight line to him once it turns.

[The Poes]

 Thankfully you only have to fight the Twin Poefighter and not both of them.
 If you get behind it while it's gathering energy for the energy balls, it'll
 cancel the attack and charge instead, so be prepared.

 Lucian: Dash out of the way when it charges and get behind it. Don't try for
 more than a couple hits or you'll probably get slammed.

 Aaron: Witch is again a good choice here. Dash out of the way when it
 charges and fire a few rounds into its back until it turns invincible or
 charges again.

[Stoker]

  Don't get too far away or he'll waste your time with missiles. Set the
  climate to Arid Desert to strengthen your attacks.

  Lucian: Honestly, even at a high level this fight will be way too tedious.
  Just bring a bunch of Fruit Yogurt and Trance your way through with Nero.
  Don't use it until right before he's done with the Sol attack or you won't
  be able to lock on and you'll waste it.

  Aaron: Ninja is the way to go here. Let the wind push you back to avoid
  getting hit by his swipe.

[Dumas]

  Quick guard to deflect Blood Cutter back at him. This guy can be a real
  problem if he repeatedly uses the aura type that you can't destroy. If
  anyone has a good strategy for dealing with that short of getting the
  Japanese version for the Sol Emblem, I'd like to hear it. Endurance Fruit,
  maybe?

  Lucian: Use Hel's charge against Blood Company and whenever he's in range.

  Aaron: Use Dragoon against Blood Company and Bomber whenever he teleports
  within range. Back up if he gets right next to you, though.

[Polidori]

  Use the same strategy that you would when you fight him normally.

[ALL]

  The Burning Headband headgear is a big help here. Load up on Heaven Fruits,
  as particularly on Platinum you can get one-hit killed with a low enough
  Vitality. Bring some Fruit Yogurt too, if you plan to rely on Trance and
  Bursts. Pratice bosses individually if you're having trouble getting
  through the whole thing, and leveling up will help too.

  Advice: This is your mainstay weapon - fairly quick, maneuverable, and good
  in a variety of situations. Its range is a little short, but it has a short
  cooldown so you can usually block in time if you don't take out your enemy
  in a single combo.

  Advice: I never used this weapon much. It's good against much weaker
  enemies, but you have less precise control over your movements, so you'll
  take damage from enemy attacks and environmental hazards a lot more often.
  It's good in multiplayer, but too slow and imprecise otherwise.

  Advice: This is a great weapon against high-level enemies, especially in
  groups. Its normal attack is the slowest of all the weapons, but it has an
  extended range, allowing you to attack from a safer distance. The charged
  spin attack will tear through groups of enemies, and is highly effective
  against bosses and enemies with lots of health.

  Advice: The Knight is Aaron's weakest weapon and not particularly useful
  once you obtain better ones. You may want to upgrade it a few times to get
  you through the first couple of chapters, but once you get the Ninja you
  likely won't look back. Be careful when using it to hit switches from a
  moving platform, as the charge shot has a knockback that can easily throw
  you right off the platform.

  Advice: Witch may seem a bit expensive at first, but at higher levels it's
  one of the most efficient guns in terms of damage to energy cost ratio. Use
  its homing ability to take out enemies around corners or at a distance. You
  can extend its range even farther (far enough to avoid getting targeted by
  Craters) by holding X to move the camera over to the target. It does have a
  few downsides, though. It's difficult to hit enemies right next to you since
  the missile travels a set direction before locking on to an enemy, and if
  you're not targetting a specific enemy the missile may not lock on to the
  closest threat.

  Advice: This is a great weapon against low- to medium-level enemies. Just
  hold down the Y Button and the R Button and watch as the enemies fall one
  after another. It takes too much time and wastes too much energy to kill
  high-level enemies, though. Also, you may want to keep it at level 5 until
  you have a lot of extra Junk Parts, since the added damage of the next few
  upgrades doesn't offset the extra energy cost.

  Advice: This gun is slow-firing and energy-intensive, but it packs a huge
          punch. It's a good choice against agile bosses, and it's the only
          weapon that isn't blocked by walls.

  [Soll]

  The dungeons in Lunar Knights are full of treasure. The most common variety
  is Soll, the currency of this world. Soll is a stored form of solar energy,
  and it can be converted back and forth for use in a Solar Station via the
  Solar Bank. You'll find it in the breakables mentioned below, and most
  enemies drop it. These are several different denominations to be found:

  · Green Coin:       5 Soll
  · Bronze Coin:     10 Soll
  · Gold Coin:       50 Soll
  · Silver Crystal: 250 Soll
  · Gold Crystal:   500 Soll

  [Treasure Chests]

  What would a dungeon be without treasure chests? These familiar objects show
  up in predetermined locations in a dungeon and contain at most one item.
  There are several varieties:

  · Orange: These are the most common type of chest and always contain the
    same item. They respawn when you leave the dungeon.

  · Green: These are rare chests which only appear once per playthrough. After
    you open them, they may contain a different item on the next playthrough,
    or on a higher difficulty level.

  · Blue: These chests also appear only once per playthrough, but they always
    contain the same item: a key. Luckily, unlocked doors remain open when you
    re-visit a dungeon.

  · Invisible: These are just normal orange chests, but they don't appear on
    the screen unless illuminated by lightning or a Clairvoyance Fruit.

  · Mimic: Well, not all chests are beneficial. These monsters appear identical
    to orange chests - that is, until you attempt to open them, at which point
    they'll take a bite out of you. They only show up in the bonus dungeon,
    though. You can find them by attacking in their direction - the attack will
    pass over a normal chest, but a Mimic will be hit.

  · Empty: These aren't much use either, but at least they don't bite you. They
    only show up in the bonus dungeon along with the Mimics.

  [Breakables]

  In addition to chests, there are a range of objects in dungeons that can be
  smashed to pieces. Most of the time, nothing will happen, but occasionally
  you'll find a minor recovery item or a handful of Soll.

  However, each dungeon has its own special breakable, each of which have an
  affinity to a specific climate and meteorological event. In their preferred
  climates, these breakables change in appearance and drop a better item. And
  if their preferred meteorological event is going on, you'll get a much better
  version of the item. You'll hear a warning buzz when a weather event is about
  to begin, so listen closely, as rain from a Tove burst and regular showers
  don't have any effect.

  These are the possible breakables you can encounter, along with a description
  of their appearance (in both standard and special forms) and the loot they
  can drop.

  In the Japanese version only, there is a crossover quest with Ryuusei no
  Rockman characters. This quest has you trying to prevent a renegade FM-ian
  by the name of Ox Fire (AKA Tauros Fire) from taking over Sabata and
  Django's world. Luckily, you'll have the assistance of Hoshikawa Subaru and
  his own FM-ian partner, War Rock.

  The quest becomes available as soon as you can visit Old Culiacan (Chapter
  3), and you don't need a copy of Ryuusei no Rockman to activate it. Simply
  go to the Old Culiacan Solar Bank and enter the following button sequence:

  Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, L, R, L, R

  If you entered it correctly, the following conversation should begin.
  (Translated by Ryken and myself)

 >---------------------------------------------------------------------------<

  Laura: Hm, a package? There's no sender's name... but there's an addressee
         name, so it's definitely a package. Sir!! A package has arrived for
         you, sir!

  [Transer] Get!!

  Django: What's this? Seems like some kind of machine, but...
  Sabata: Some piece of scrap with an unknown sender... there's no time to
          care about such a thing, discard it!
  Django: Aww, what a waste! Couldn't it be some kind of amazing weapon?
  Sabata: ...hmm, fine. Let's try and ask Sheridan about it...

  (at Sheridan's Mansion)

  Sheridan: Hey, what's up?
    Sabata: Professor, there's something we want to show you.
  Sheridan: Oh? Once again, you've gotten your hands on an unusual thing.
    Sabata: It's a piece of scrap from an unknown sender. Appears to be a
            device of some sort or other, but...
  Sheridan: Some kind of device? Th, this is... let me take a quick look at
            this!
    Django: He's gone...
    Sabata: Seems like it wasn't just any old piece of scrap.
  Sheridan: I was surprised! It seems it's some manner of connection
            device... but the technology that made this is completely
            different from this planet's magic-science. Perhaps our [Network]
            has connected to another world...
    Sabata: Another world?
    Django: What do you mean?

 *Transer email sound effect*

  Sabata: ...!?
     ???: Hello......can anyone hear me?
  Sabata: ...who is this!?
     ???: ...you can hear me! It's a success, Amachi-san!!
  Django: Amachi-san?
     ???: Ah, sorry... Pleased to meet you. Um... I'm Hoshikawa Subaru. I'm
          corresponding from Earth in the 23rd century. This is probably a
          surprise so suddenly... but I'd like you to hear me out.
  Sabata: 23rd century, you say...?
  Django: Ahah, sounds interesting!! Subaru-kun, right? So, what do you
          have to say?
  Subaru: Unfortunately, it's not an interesting talk... your guys' world
          is being targeted by an FM-ian.
  Django: FM-ian?
  Subaru: It seems somehow from our world, he's transferred across space-
          time. His name is Ox Fire... he's a very brutal and dangerous
          guy.
  Django: Ox Fire...
  Subaru: Because FM-ian's bodies are made of elecrtical waves, you can't see
          them with your eyes. On top of that, they can enter a person's
          heart and show them illusions, and control that person. They are
          using that power to ruin this planet... at this rate, your world is
          also in danger!
  Django: That's... Sabata, we have to do something!
  Sabata: ...
  Subaru: Using Amachi-san's dimensional connection system, we've
          investigated you guys. They talked about Vampire Hunters... Pitch-
          Black Swordsman Sabata and Apprentice Gunfighter Django!! Now, none
          but you can oppose the FM-ian. For the sake of protecting this
          planet as well, I'd like you to help me defeat Ox Fire!
  Django: Understood, Subaru-kun!! Leave it to us!
  Sabata: Don't just go deciding that on your own. ...You're called Subaru?
          Sorry, but... I can't help you.
  Subaru: Eh?
  Sabata: How do we know you're not the ones who are aiming to attack our
          world?
  Subaru: Please, believe me! Without a trusting heart, you can't beat the
          FM-ian... without a trusting heart, we can't share our power with
          you guys.
  Sabata: Your power?
  Subaru: Yes... One is that machine. It's called a Transer, it's a portable
          information computer terminal connecting our worlds. While we can't
          send people, we can talk.
  Sabata: ...
  Subaru: That's not all. If you use the Transer's [Brother Band System], we
          can support you in battle.
  Django: Brother Band?
  Subaru: Brother Band, it's the bond between those capable of trusting one
          another from the heart. If you use Brother Band, you can trade
          friend data to power up characters and accessories.
  Django: Heeh!
  Subaru: The data trade isn't just for friends with [Boktai DS], but can be
          done with friends with [Ryusei no Rockman] as well.
  Django: Awesome!!
  Subaru: You're interested? Then one more thing... allow me to introduce my
          friend.
  Django: Friend?
  Subaru: Yes... he's got a bad mouth, but he's a dependable guy. I'm
          transporting him now.
  Sabata: Wait a second!! I thought you can't send humans!?

  *Transer sound effect*

  Subaru: Well, did he arrive?
  Sabata: ...
  Django: Nothing's appearing?
  Subaru: Ah, that's right! Hold on just a bit, I'm sending one more item.

  *Transer sound effect*

  [Visualizer] get!!

    Subaru: What I just sent you is a [Visualizer]. You can't see my friend
            without that.
    Django: What do you mean by tha... woah!!
    Sabata: What's got you so surprised... ...!?
       ???: (not sure what he's saying)
    Subaru: Rock, looks like you made it there alright.
       ???: Suppose so.
    Sabata: This guy can't be...
       ???: My name is War Rock... ...an FM-ian like Ox Fire.
    Sabata: What's the meaning of this?
    Subaru: It's OK. Though he's also an FM-ian, Rock is our ally. To put it
            in terms of your guys' world, it's an existence like the
            Terrennials.
  War Rock: I'm not at my normal ability due to the space-time crossing, but
            if you use the Brother Band System and take on the [Ryusei no
            Rockman] friend data, I should soon be able to restore my real
            power.
    Django: I see! As the friend data gets stronger, War Rock also powers up!
    Subaru: Well? After all this, won't you trust me?
    Sabata: ...
    Django: Sabata!!
    Sabata: Hmm... I give up. Even having to take along such a guy...
    Subaru: ...Great!! Alright? Ox Fire should be hidden somewhere in your
            world. Like Rock, he's probably not at full power yet. Rock will
            let you guys know if you get close, so first arrive at Ox Fire's
            location and stop him. Well then Rock, I'm trusting the support
            of them to you!
  War Rock: Well, that's how it is. Let's get along for a short time?
    Sabata: Fine... I'll be testing out that power.
    Django: Nice to meet you, Rock!!

  Electric wave Terrennial [War Rock]'s power acquired!!

  Sheridan: Surprising. An electric wave Terrennial... because it's lost its
            full power, it doesn't look like it can Burst, but like other
            Terrennials' Elemental Attacks it seems it can heighten the
            attack power of sword and gun attacks. The Brother Band option on
            the [Network] menu will allow you to exchange [Ryusei no Rockman]
            friend data with your [Bokura no Taiyou DS] friend data, thereby
            powering up each other's abilities.

 >---------------------------------------------------------------------------<

  At this point you will be able to equip War Rock as a Terrennial, giving
  you increased attack power without an elemental affinity. The power and
  duration of his abilities depend on the number of Brother Bands you have,
  so start making friends! As for his burst attack, you need to defeat Ox
  Fire to unlock it.

  Ox Fire has taken up residence in 13th Street and is taking control of the
  monsters there. To seek him out, select 13th Street, then choose the new
  quest that has appeared on the bottom of the list. You will start a mission
  just like the other quests you have done.

 >---------------------------------------------------------------------------<

  (Beginning the Find Ox Fire! mission)

  War Rock: He's here... I can sense his presence! 

  (Approaching the abandoned building in Rooftops North on my map)

  War Rock: Careful... he's close!

  (On top of the building)

  War Rock: Long time no see, Ox Fire!!
   Ox Fire: Bururuh!! You're War Rock!?
  War Rock: Yo, how ya been?
   Ox Fire: Bururuh!! Fancy meeting you in a place like this! Weren't
            terribly affected by the space-time shift, were you? Just what do
            you hope to accomplish in that body?
  War Rock: You say that, but you're not at full strength either, are you?
   Ox Fire: It won't be long before I recover fully. Once that happens, I
            could destroy a world like this in an instant.
    Django: We won't let you!
   Ox Fire: Bururururuh!! Who are these brats? But this is perfect... I'll
            use you to test the power of the monsters I control!
   Ox Fire: Go, monsters! Buruooooh!!

  (after the battle)

  Ox Fire: Bururuh!! Not bad! I'll let you off easy this time. Farewell!
   Subaru: Are you okay!? Ox Fire is still hiding somewhere, trying to gain
           more time. Hurry and find him before his full power returns. We
           need to stop him! I'm counting on all of you!!

 >---------------------------------------------------------------------------<

  Ox fire flees the scene and escapes to Hunting Mansion: Forecourt. Select
  the new mission there to chase after him.

 >---------------------------------------------------------------------------<

  (Beginning the Find Ox Fire! mission)

  War Rock: He's here... I can sense his presence!

  (In the Prep Room)

  War Rock: Careful... he's right ahead!

  (In the Boss Room)

  War Rock: Found you, Ox fire!
   Ox Fire: Bururuh!! You're annoyingly persistent! Just a bit longer and
            I'll be at full power... guess there's no choice! Go, Antlion!
            Buruoooh!!

  (After the Battle)

  Ox Fire: Bururuh!! You guys are a real hassle. I'll spare your lives for a
           while longer. Later!
   Subaru: He ran away again...
   Sabata: What's going on? No matter how much we attack him, it doesn't have
           any effect?
   Subaru: That's it... his true form is an electric wave, so you can't
           damage him with direct attacks. But on the other hand, he can
           control monsters with those eletric waves...
   Django: No way...
   Sabata: Damn!! If we could only use Burst with War Rock, who's made of the
           same electric waves...
   Subaru: Burst? That's it, if we could borrow the power of your Trance...
   Sabata: ...?
   Subaru: There's no time... at any rate, find Ox Fire again and stop him.
   Django: Do we have a strategy? Okay, I'll give it a try!

 >---------------------------------------------------------------------------<

  Once more Ox Fire escapes, this time to Hunting Mansion: Interior.

 >---------------------------------------------------------------------------<

  (Beginning the Find Ox Fire! mission)

  War Rock: He's here... I can sense his presence!

  (In the Prep Room)

  War Rock: Careful... he's right ahead!

  (In the Boss Room)

  War Rock: Ox Fire!! Don't run away this time!
   Ox Fire: Bururuh!! You're too late! My power is already at Max Heat!! Soon
            every monster in this world will do my bidding!
    Django: What!?
    Sabata: Our opponent is no slouch... If anyone gets in my way, I take him
            down. Plain and simple.
  War Rock: Ox Fire... no matter how many beasts you gather, after all, trash
            is just trash.
    Django: You two aren't worried? Then neither am I!
   Ox Fire: Burururuh!! You're all morons! Fine, if you want to die that
            much... I'll turn you to ashes!
   Ox Fire: Go, monsters! Buruoooh!!

  (after losing)

   Ox Fire: Bururururuh!! Is that it? You're the one who's trash, War Rock!!
  War Rock: Kuh...
    Sabata: It's not over yet!! I still have things I need to do. I can't die
            here!
    Django: But, at this rate...

  *Transer sound effect*

  Subaru: Are you all okay!? ...thank goodness!! Looks like luck is on our
          side. Amachi-san managed to upgrade the communication device in this
          short time. Now with your cooperation, I should be able to transport
          to your world!
  Django: Really, you can!?
  Sabata: What are you talking about!?
  Subaru: By borrowing your Trance power, even a human like me can make the
          space-time jump to your world, if only for a short time. If I'm
          there, I can fuse with Rock and become Rockman. As Rockman I'm made
          of eletric waves, so I should be able to attack Ox Fire in person!
  Sabata: I see... so it'll be a Burst attack from Rockman.
  Django: Yeah! I don't really get it, but now we can defeat Ox Fire!
  Sabata: Let's go!
  Django: OK, Sabata!!

  (after battle)

  Ox Fire: Gwaaaaaaaah!! Dammit... There's no way I could be... defeated
           by... these brats!!

  Rockman: Thank you! Sabata, Django!! Thanks to you we were able to defeat
           Ox Fire!
   Django: No, we're the ones who should thank you. But what a surprise! You
           fusing with Rock... it's just like our Trance!
  Rockman: Yeah. And from now on, you can Trance with Rock out and I'll come
           help!
   Django: Wow! We're friends already!
   Sabata: Friends... no we're not.
  Rockman: Right, our bond of friendship is much stronger than that. From now
           on, we're [Brothers]!!
   Django: Yeah... Brothers!

  *Transer sound effect*

  Rockman: It's from Amachi-san... Sorry, but it's about time for me to
           return to my own world.
   Django: Will you come back?
  Rockman: Don't worry... we're connected by a Brother Band. No matter what
           happens, our hearts are tied together.
   Django: Okay...
  Rockman: Well then, see you later!
   Django: See you later, Rockman!!
   Sabata: Sheesh, what a spacey guy... until we meet again, Rockman!!

  Burst with Electric Wave Terrennial [War Rock] is now possible!!

 >---------------------------------------------------------------------------<

  That concludes the crossover quest. You will now be able to use a burst
  attack with War Rock where Rockman shoots at the area where you point with
  the stylus. The more brothers you have, the longer the Burst will last and
  the more powerful it will be.

/                             '-----------------'                      [CONV] \

  Perishable items can be a big source of frustration. However, in the right
  conditions, it's possible to end up with a higher quality item instead. In
  most of these cases, the item's freshness meter will stop running out, but
  after a set period (up to an entire game day), it will transform. Here are
  all possible beneficial conversions:

 · Earth Fruit --> Cure Bulb
   Temperature > 95ºF (35ºC)
   Restores 20% more health and never rots

 · Solar Fruit --> Magic Bulb
   Wind Speed > 13.4mph (6m/s)
   Restores 20% more energy and never rots

 · Delicious Meat --> Dried Meat
   Humidity < 20%
   Restores 20% more health and never rots

 · Magical Ice Pop --> Miracle Ice Pop
   Temperature < 32ºF (0ºC)
   Restores 10% more energy and never melts

 · Chocolate + Milk --> Milk Chocolate
   Let Chocolate melt directly above Milk
   Combines effects of both items and never goes bad

 · Chocolate + Chocolate --> Deluxe Chocolate
   Let Chocolate melt directly above Chocolate
   Combines effects of both items and never goes bad

 · Chocolate + Power Fruit --> Chocolate Banana
   Let Chocolate melt directly above a Power Fruit
   50% greater damage boost and never goes bad

 · Chocolate + another item --> Chocolate Gob
   Let Chocolate melt directly above any other item
   Never goes bad, and can be consumed to recover the original item

 · Milk --> Yogurt
   Temperature between 77ºF (25ºC) and 104ºF (40ºC)
   Humidity between 60% and 75%
   Restores 20% more TRC and never goes bad

 · Milk + a fruit item --> Fruit Yogurt
   Temperature between 77ºF (25ºC) and 104ºF (40ºC)
   Humidity between 60% and 75%
   Place Milk directly above any fruit item
   Restores 40% more TRC and never goes bad

 · Magical Ice Pop --> Winner Stick
   Usually, a Magical Ice Pop will leave behind a Loser Stick when you eat
   it or allow it to melt. Rarely, you'll get a Winner Stick instead. Sell
   it to the store for a free replacement popsicle.

 =============================| Removing Curses |=============================
/                             '-----------------'                      [CRSE] \

  In the bonus dungeon, Vambery, you can obtain three special pieces of
  equipment - the Cursed Mask, Cursed Scarf, and Cursed Boots. These
  accessories initially reduce one of your stats by 8 points, which would
  seem to make them the worst accessories in the game, but with a little
  effort it's possible to reverse that effect and gain a +8 bonus instead.

  Each accessory has a hidden counter that increases while you wear it, and
  when it hits the magic number 666, the curse is lifted. The following
  actions all contribute to the counter:

  · 1 point for every enemy killed
  · 1 point for every enemy that spawns from the ground
  · Rapid point gain while fighting Stoker
  · 1 point for every boss summoning attack by Polidori

  ...and potentially more. Gold Boss Rush against Stoker seems to be the
  fastest way to go, though.

  Unfortunately, this system is particularly prone to bugs. If you are
  wearing two Cursed accessories at a time, or if you have one equipped to
  both characters at the same time, there is a very high chance that your
  game will freeze when the curse is lifted. To avoid this, only transform
  one piece of Cursed equipment at a time, and save to a different slot just
  in case. Once the accessories are safely converted, you shouldn't have any
  trouble with them.

/                          '----------------------'                    [WPFX] \

  There is a rumor going around that the Old Solar Gun and Broken Dark Gun
  can be converted into functional weapons. It's false. They only exist as
  easter eggs for people who have played the previous games, and their only
  use is to be sold at the item shop for large amounts of Soll.

\                          .----------------------.                           /
 ==========================| Boktai Solar Sensors |===========================
/                          '----------------------'                    [SOLR] \

  As Lunar Knights is a sequel to the Boktai series, it includes lock-on
  functionality with the old games. Simply insert one of the Boktai game
  carts into the GBA slot on your DS, and when you load your Lunar Knights
  save, you will be prompted to calibrate the "resting" light level for the
  Solar Sensor. Simply cover the black square on the cart and press A to
  continue.

  Once your game is loaded, the lock-on feature gives you a couple of new
  features. First, you can visit the Acuna General Store to buy the Sound
  Data corresponding to the game used (If you're playing the US or EU
  version of Lunar Knights, you will automatically unlock Shinbok's sound
  data once you have the other two). Second, you will have a new Valuable
  in your inventory. They all boost the light level in your game by the
  amount from the Solar Sensor and charge up the Solar Station, but each one
  has an additional unique effect:

  Ver. 1: Recovers ENE for the character you are not actively using.
  Ver. 2: Recovers Life for the character you are not actively using.
  Ver. 3: Charges TRC for the character you are not actively using.

  To obtain this effect, you must first enter a dungeon and then activate the
  new item. It will ask you to set the value of the Solar Gauge - find the
  brightest angle and press A to set the value. You'll have to do this each
  time you enter a new area, but once you've set the gauge you don't need to
  remain in direct sunlight to maintain the boost.

\                                 .--------.                                  /
 =================================| Quests |==================================
/                                 '--------'                           [QUES] \

  Quests are optional challenges which take place in dungeons, rewarding you
  with an item for satisfying the conditions of the challenge. They're
  obtained from ordinary people, but there are a few requirements you must
  satisfy before a client will offer a quest:

  · You must have cleared the dungeon where the quest takes place.
  · You must clear the first quest for a dungeon before you can receive the
    second quest.
  · Some clients have multiple quests for you, but you must clear the first
    quest before they will give you another one.
  · You may need to talk to a client 3 times in a row to go through their
    normal dialogues first.
  · You must be able to find the client to talk with them. This means no
    guild quests can be obtained before Chapter 3 or after Chapter 5.

  If you're at the end of the game and you've missed some quests, don't
  worry. You can obtain the quests on your next playthrough. However, you may
  have to satisfy the above conditions again, as NPCs won't remember your
  quest progress.

/                                 '---------'                          [ENEM] \

  Enemies are organized into several categories based on their defining
  characteristics:
  - Normal enemies loiter around on the map.
  - Spawning enemies appear out of the ground when you approach.
  - Patrolling enemies follow a predetermined route and respond to
    whistling or a line of sight detection.
  - Stationary Enemies may be stationary or follow a set path, and serve as
    makeshift environmental hazards.
  - Mid-Bosses are powerful non-story enemies.
  - Bosses are the villains of the game.

  Certain enemies have multiple elemental forms. Some of these enemies will
  change their element based on the current environmental conditions - for
  instance, high temperatures may cause Hot versions to show up, and high
  humidity may cause Petro versions to show up. Keep this in mind when you
  choose your climate.

  For item drops, Junk Parts are inditected in ALL CAPS.

  parry their clubs to catch them off guard.

 [Pig] (Sol)
  "Attacks by rushing at you."
  - Protect Fruit / Delicious Meat

  of them.


 ---------------------------- Patrolling Enemies -----------------------------

 [Hound] (Dark)

  - LEATHER / Speed Fruit
  Lunges frequently. Try to sneak up on it.

 [Hot Dog] (Flame)
  "Bites at any enemy it finds. Causes Burning with its Fire Breath."

 [Ice Dog] (Frost)

  - ADAMANT / METEORITE
  Stun it by Quick Guarding the ball and chain attack.

 [Spotter] (Sol)

  "Alerts any nearby snipers to your position upon discovery."
   Only appears in Stealth areas. Make sure to take out at least one for the
   enemy list entry. If the alert timer runs out you will automatically die,
   so either take them out quickly or try and lose them.


 ---------------------------- Stationary Enemies -----------------------------

 [Lion Statue]
  "Fires Sol Beams at regular intervals."
  Attack from the side to be safe.

 [Axe Armor]
  "Attacks with its axe when you approach."
  Does a lot of damage, so attack from the side or from a distance.

 [Pillar]
  "Moves to and fro, its spikes constantly rotating."
  These can't be killed so just watch their patterns and avoid them.

 [Evil Eye]
  "Fires faintness-inducing Stun Shots at regular intervals."
  Careful with these, as they can immobilize you. Attack from the side.

 [Crater]
  "Attacks with Grenade Bombs when you approach."
  Use Witch from a distance to take them out without getting in range of their
  grenades.

 [Cannon]
  "Fires Elemental Shots when you approach."
  Use a ranged weapon or attack from the side. Not much of a threat if you
  stay out of its line of fire.

 [Popbud]
  "Bursts open when you attack it, spreading seeds around the area."
  Hit it once then face it and hold up your shield to avoid getting hit.

 [Pork Cannon]
  "A cannon manned by a Pork. Attacks with Sol Shots when you approach."
  Use a ranged weapon or attack from the side. Not much of a threat if you
  stay out of its line of fire.

 [Arsenal]
  "Spits out mines when you approach."
  Best attacked from a distance, as you'll likely get hit by a mine when
  attacking up close.

 [Toadstool]
  "Fires confusion-inducing spores at regular intervals."
  Best attacked from a distance, as they have no ranged attack.

 [Pork Cannon Mk. II]
  "A patrolling version of the Pork Cannon. Attacks at regular intervals
   with Sol Shots."
  Use Witch to take it out from the side if you can't get close to it. You can
  also deflect its shots back at it, though that takes more time.

 [Urchin]
  "Moves by bouncing along the walls."
  Similar to the Pillar and just as indestructable. Watch their movements to
  predict their path and quickly run by.

 [Mine]
  "Explodes when you approach."
  Shoot them down before they get too close.

 [Librarian]
  "Poisons you with its bite when you approach."
  You can find these by locking on with R. Either run past or approach slowly
  from the side to get them to leave their hiding places.

 [Grenade Cannon]
  "Fires Grenade Bombs when you approach."
  Best dealt with in the same way as a Crater. At least they can't fire at you
  from all directions.

 [Serpent Statue]
  "Fires freezing Cold Breath at regular intervals."
  Take them out from the side or run past when they're not attacking.

 [Pork Vulcan]
  "A vulcan cannon manned by a Pork. Fires faintness-inducing Stun Shots when
   you approach.
  Attack from the side if at all possible, since it has rapid fire.

 -------------------------------- Mid-Bosses ---------------------------------

 [Antlion] (Sol)
  "Attacks include Pounce, Bite, Sol Beam, and Scorpion Tail."
  Keep your guard up when it attacks. You should be able to get in a combo or
  two after each attack.

 [Goat Chimera] (Dark)
  "Attacks include Pounce, Charge, Dark Breath, and Snake Head."
  For an easy victory, go into Trance with Toasty and spam Y. Otherwise, use
  the same strategy as above.

 [Dragon Chimera] (Flame/Frost)
  "Attacks include Pounce, Fire Breath, Cold Breath, Flame Rain, Frost Rain,
   and Snake Head. Switches elements on the fly."
  Try to Quick Guard its attacks and counter with the appropriate element.
  When it shakes the screen, keep moving to avoid the rain attack.

 [Manticore]
  "Attacks include Pounce, Cloud Beam, Earth Beam, Radical Hair and Scorpion
   Tail. Also creates a mirror image of itself, making it difficult to hit."
  Try not to stand in front of it or you'll be grabbed. Instead get in a few
  hits while it's busy attacking in a different direction, then evade.

 ---------------------------------- Bosses -----------------------------------

 [Rymer] (Flame)
  "Uses his Dark Gun "Archer" to fire iron arrows, fire arrows, and grenades.
   Also uses traps and a spear."
  Go into Trance with Nero and spam Y to destroy him easily.

 [Edgar] (Cloud)
  "Attacks with mostly punch-based fighting moves. Invulnerable to Solar Gun
   attacks."
  They share a lifebar, so use Lucian when this one is in play.

 [Virginia] (Earth)
  "Attacks with mostly kick-based fighting moves. Invulnerable to Dark Sword
   attacks."
  They share a lifebar, so use Aaron when this one is in play.

 [Dual Poefighter]
  "The combined form of Edgar and Virginia's fighters. Punches, kicks, and
   fires energy balls."
  Dodge when it jumps at you then get in a few hits while it pauses after
  attacking.

 [Stoker] (Frost)
  "Attacks include Sol Breath, Dark Breath, Sol Claw, Dark Claw, Double Claw,
   Ice Grenade, and Freeze Beam."
  When he lifts one claw to attack, hit the other one with its weakness, then
  blast his exposed head with Flame shots.

 [Dumas] (Dark)
  "Attacks include Blood Claw, Blood Cross, Blood Edge, Blood Cutter, Blood
   Company, and Nightmare. Can also counter Trance-based attacks."
  During the first half he mostly uses Blood Cutter, which can be deflected
  back at him with a Quick Guard. Kinda makes you feel like you're in a Zelda
  game, huh? Keep your distance. His close-range attacks can eat right through
  your guard and stun you. If he starts to gather energy in a colored aura,
  hit it with the opposite element or get ready for a world of pain. The bat
  company attack can be countered pretty well with the Dragoon weapon. His
  attacks get faster and he uses stronger attacks more often as his HP
  dwindles, so you might want to save your Trance for the second half of the
  battle. You'll have to engage in a struggle if you attack him in Trance
  mode, though, and Bursts will only get one hit in before he escapes.

 [Polidori]
  "Attacks include Radical Arm, Hysteric Arm, Attractive Dance, Tactical Fang,
   Savage Fang, and Summon Vampire."
  Keep your distance. He has several different attack patterns. One is to lob
  Slimes at you - parry the gray ones back at him for solid damage, but avoid
  the green ones, as even if you block they will splash on your shield and
  poison you. Another attack is to send out spikes that follow you - just keep
  moving (if necessary, running) and that one's not too dangerous. If he
  slowly homes in on your position, stay away from the shadow, as he'll crush
  you for massive damage. Not an extremely difficult fight if you're careful.
  He also has the ability to summon the bosses you've fought so far for short
  periods of time. You can't damage them, so keep running and evade their
  attacks.
