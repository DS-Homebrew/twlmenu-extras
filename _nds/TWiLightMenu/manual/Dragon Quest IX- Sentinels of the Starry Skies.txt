==============================================================================

Hello everyone! Welcome to my FAQ/Walkthrough for Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels
of the Starry Skies! This is my first FAQ for a Dragon Quest game, and boy,
this game is huge! The Dragon Quest series have been popular in Japan since
late 80's, and being the most anticipated jRPG series in that country, it's no
wonder Dragon Quest IX was welcomed very warmly in Japan (to say the least).
I sure hope American and European gamers will love the game too. You should
also probably know that this particular installment is innovative for the
series as a whole: it's a DS exclusive, it doesn't have random encounters 
(except when sailing on a ship), it has various multiplayer options that keep
players busy long after they complete the main game, etc. I was intending to
write a walkthrough for this game for the longest time, and now I'm glad I'm
able to do it. Hope you'll enjoy the game as much as I did!

==============================================================================
II.................................GAME BASICS...........................DQIX2
==============================================================================

--------------------------
1. CREATING YOUR CHARACTER
--------------------------

After attempting to start a new adventure in Dragon Quest IX, you are prompted
to create your own character. Your actions here are not limited just to giving
him/her a name; you can actually customize your character's appearance. The 
main characteristics would be:

1. Gender (Male or Female)
2. Body Type (5 types)
3. Hairstyle (10 types)
4. Hair Color (10 types)
5. Face (10 facial structure types)
6. Skin Colour (8 types)
7. Eye Colour (8 types)
8. Name (forst name only, limited to 8 characters)

------------------
2. CHURCH SERVICES
------------------

In Dragon Quest IX, there are churches in each town. The church is a place 
where you can do many useful things. Its services are as follows:

Confession (Save) - this is a save option.
Divination - the priest tells you how many experience points your characters
need to level up.
Benediction - the priest removes a curse for a certain amount of money (based
on your current level)
Resurrection - the priest resurrects your character(s) for a certain amount of
money (based on your current level)
Purification - the priest purifies you, removing poison status from your
character(s).

After the confession, you can also choose to suspend your current playthrough
by just exiting it for the time being. Remember that Dragon Quest IX allows
the player to only have 1 slot save slot per game card. If you die in combat,
you'll be automatically transported to the nearest Prayer Room.

------------
3. MAIN MENU
------------

The main menu is activated by pressing the X button in the field.

• Items
  This option lets you see the current items in your inventory. There are 3
  main categories by which the items are sorted:
  • Everyday Items
    This submenu shows you the items that your characters carry as well as the
    items that are placed in your bag. One character can carry up to 8 items
    and use them in battle. The bag's inventory doesn't have restrictions. It
    can carry up to 99 units of one item. You can press SELECT to sort the
    items in your bag.
  • Important Items
    This submenu shows you only the items that are important for the story.
  • Treasure Maps
    This submenu shos you the Treasure Maps, their level, their location on
    the world map (by showing you a small fragment on the top screen), as well
    as the info about them. You can press the shoulder buttons to hide or show
    the info. Press SELECT to sort them by type, level or status.

• Equip
  In this menu, you can equip your character with the equipment you bought/
  found/made. You can do that with the help of the stylus just by dragging the
  icon of the piece of equipment on your character. Or you can use the D-Pad
  of your DS to do that. Press the Y button to change characters in this menu.

• Attributes
  This menu shows you the attributes (stats) of your characters. The upper
  screen has the info about your current equipment, while the lower screen
  shows you your character's level, vocation, current EXP and skill allocation
  of the chosen vocation. On the right, it shows you the stats of your party
  member, like strength, agility, charm, etc, as well as his/her max. HP and
  MP. Press the shoulder buttons to rotate your character. Press the A button
  to change categories of stats: overall stats - spells - abilities - traits -
  vocation levels.

• Spells & Abilities
  This menu lets you use your characters' spells and abilities (like Heal, 
  Whistle, Squelch, etc.) in the field. Note that some skills can only be used
  in battle, and thus, they are not shown in this menu.

• Battle Records
  The Battle Records menu becomes available after Stella joins you in Angel
  Falls. It has seven submenus:
  • Defeated Monster List
    This submenu shows you the list of monsters you've defeated, as well their
    locations, item drops, etc.
  • Wardrobe
    This submenu shows you the number of equipment you've collected (found/
    bought/made).
  • Item List
    This submenu shows you the number of items you've collected (found/bought/
    made), as well as all the important items you've obtained so far.
  • Alchenomicon
    This submenu lists the items and equipment you've made so far by using
    alchemy. Note that you need to find recipes to be able to make various
    items through alchemy.
  • Accolades Earnt
    This submenu shows you the accolades you've earnt so far. Accolades are
    awarded to for doing various things in the game, like reaching some level
    in your vocation proficiency or fighting 500 battles. There are about 300
    different accolades in the game.
  • Quest List
    This submenu shows you the number of quests you've taken and completed.
    The completed ones are marked with a star.
  • First Completion Records
    After beating the game, you'll get this submenu to show you the time you
    spent playing before beating the game, battle victories, completed quests,
    etc. 

• Misc.
  This is a "Miscellaneous" menu that lets you deal with the game's settings
  and has some other necessary functions.
  • Heal All
    This is a very handy submenu that uses party members' magic to fully
    restore the party's HP as efficiently as possible. It's very useful if you
    need to heal yourself quickly.
  • Tactics
    Allows you to change your party member's tactics, line-up and personal
    colours. You can't set tactics for your Hero, though.
  • Allocate Skill Points
    This submenu allos you to distribute any unused skill points your party
    members have saved up.
  • Assign Party Tricks
    This submenu lets you set which party tricks can be performed with the B
    button and the D-Pad.
  • Profile Settings
    This submenu allows you to change your profile settings (home country,
    birthday, title, speach style and greeting).
  • Volume Settings
    Allows you to change settings such as the music and sound effect volumes.
  • Quick Save
    Temporarily suspends your adventure in its current state.

----------------
4. BATTLE SYSTEM
----------------

The battle system in Dragon Quest IX is turn-based, so can take your time when
selecting the actions for your characters. They (the characters) make their
moves based on their agility (the enemies do the same), so the higher your
agility is, the faster your action will come. In battle, you can use regular
physical attacks, weapon/shield abilities, magic (offensive or defensive) and
items from your characters' inventory. When the battle starts, you'll have 4
options:

  • Fight
    This option allows you to start the actual fight. You'll have 6 different
    options here:
    • Attack
    Regular physical attack.
    • Abilities
    Weapon/shield abilities that you have learnt from the skill point 
    allocation. Note that you can only use the abilities of your current
    weapon type.
    • Spells
    Spells that you've learned by leveling up your vocation. Note that some
    vocations (like Warrior) don't have any spells at all.
    • Items
    Use one of the 8 items that you've put in your character's inventory.
    • Defend
    Defend to reduce the damage for one turn.
    • Coup de Grace
    Basically, Coup de Grace is a special attack in this game. Every vocation
    has their own Coups, and they are triggered randomly during the course of
    the battle. Sometimes you have to survive a critical hit to trigger it,
    sometimes you have to just defend for it to kick in. I haven't been able
    to discover what EXACTLY triggers Coup de Grace, so if you have some info
    about it, you're welcome to share it with me.

  • Examine
    This option lets you see the enemies' reaction/possibly predict their next
    move or remind you what they did in the previous turn.

  • Flee
    This option allows you to escape the battle. Note that it might not work
    if the enemies are too tough for you at your current level and may require
    a few retries. Also, you cannot flee from boss battles or chest ambushes.

  • Misc.
    This option allows you to change your line-up, equipment or tactics during
the battle.
    • Tactics
    Lets you choose the tactics for your character (except the Hero).
    • Equipment
    Lets you switch you weapons during the battles. Note that you can only use
    the weapons your current vocation lets you use.
    • Line-Up
    Lets you change the line-up of your characters in battle. Characters with
    vocations like Priest, Mage, Sage should be out in the Back Line.

The stylus is used to move your character and pick various options during 
battles, environment exploring, and moving on with the cutscenes. Not only can
you move your character with the help of a stylus (you also get a nice blue
arrow pointing at the direction you've chosen), you can talk to NPCs just by
tapping on them with the stylus (like you could in, let's say, The Legend of
Zelda: Phantom Hourglass). You need to tap on the bubble above their heads to
trigger the conversation. You'll have to press the A button to do that, if you
are not using the stylus. The upper screen represents the map of the current
town/region you're in, while the lower touch-screen shows your character/
party. That's where you control them. During battles, the screens switch
places: the upper screen illustrates battle animation, while the lower screen
lets you input commands during battle or change settings, etc.
You can play without the use of the stylus. That's where DS buttons come in:

A - Action button. Use it confirm your choices in battle, menu, etc. Also use
it to talk to NPCs.
B - The back button.
B (Hold) + D-Pad - Party Trick.
Y - This button brings up the story consensus.
X - The menu button.
D-Pad - Use to move your character around, and navigate through various menus.
Shoulder buttons are used to rotate the camera in Dragon Quest IX.
START and SELECT buttons are not used.

IV...........................VARIOUS HINTS AND TIPS......................DQIX4
==============================================================================

 • Keep your money in the bank in Stornway inn. If you die in battle, you lose
half of your money! So it's better just to store it somewhere safe, isn't it?

 • Use the "Heal All" command from the Misc. menu to save yourself some time.

 • Check all cupboards, wardrobes, jars and barrels for hidden items. Check
the bookshelves for achemy recipes.

 • Red chests can only be opened by the Hero. Blue chests can be opened by
anyone in your party. Their contents respawn after a certain amount of time or
after your turn off your DS.

 • Some blue chests can be trapped! There are three kinds of chest traps in 
the game - Canniboxes, Mimics and Pandora's Boxes (Cannibox is the weakest).
These enemies are especially common in treasure map grottoes, so be on your
guard.

 • Steal items from enemies with the thief's ability "Half-inch". Trigger
thief's Coup de Grace called "Itemised Kill" to get guaranteed loot from the
enemy!

 • To kill Metal enemies quickly, use moves like Metal Slash (Sword), Hatchet
Man (Axe) and Assassin's Stab (Knife).

 • Always keep the weaker party members (like Priest or Sage) in the back row.
This may save them from a lot of attacks.

V...............................THE WALKTHROUGH..........................DQIX5
==============================================================================


==============================================================================
PROLOGUE.................................................................WALK1
==============================================================================

Create your Hero and watch the introductory scenes. Soon after that, you'll be
thrown into your first battle in the game against 2 Slimes and a Cruelcumber.
Nothing hard here, just hit them with regular attacks, and your other party
member will do the same, but, like, ten times better :P. After yet another
scene you'll find yourself in the Celestrian Observatory, where you need to
speak with the Major about your recent heroic deeds. Before visitng him, I 
advice you to just run around the place, get familiar with the controls and
speak with some NPCs. You can save your game by going in on of the doors near
the north stairway. There's a Prayer Room.

==============================================================================
OBSERVATORY..............................................................WALK2
==============================================================================

.-------------------------------------. In the southwest corner there is a
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | fellow Celestrian who can heal you. It
|-------------------------------------| is not that you need that right now...
| • Medicinal Herb                    | Run to the opposite corner and open
| • Chimaera Wing                     | the nearby door there. Examine the all
| • 50 Gold Coins                     | the jars there to find a [MEDICINAL
| • Wakerobin                         | HERB] and open the chest for [CHIMAERA
| • Holy Water                        | WING]. Take the central stairway to
| • Seed of Life                      | the second floor (or L2, as the map
'-------------------------------------' informs you). Proceed north to meet
                                        Apus Major. It turns out you must offer
up that Benevolessence item you got earlier to the great tree of Yggdrasil. 
You can find some gold coins in the east part of this floor. Enter the big
door in the northwest corner for a scene with your teacher, Aquila. From this
floor, take the south exit. You'll be in a much bigger area now. Run all the
way left, and then up to find a chest with [50 GOLD COINS]. In the opposite 
corner of this area you'll find a chest with [WAKEROBIN] on the upper level.
Not far from the chest with coins, there's another one that contains [HOLY
WATER]. When you're finished with the treasure hunting, talk to the Celestrian
guarding the the stairway and he'll let you pass.  Climb the stairs all the
way to the top and offer the Benevolessence up to Yggdrasil. After setting
the tree aglow, talk to Aquila and return to Apus Major. Speak with him, and
he'll say you can now travel to the world below with the help of the portal
on the first floor. Under the central stairway leading to L2, you can find a
chest with [SEED OF LIFE]. Save your game, and talk to the woman near the
portal. Choose to descend to the Protectorate.

.-------------------------------------. You'll be able to fly for a short 
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | while, so don't be too surprised. In
|-------------------------------------| the east part of the village there is
| • Medicinal Herb                    | a shop (the building with a wing 
| • Horse Manure                      | emblem). You can't buy anything right
| • Keepsake Ring                     | now, but check the wardrobe for some
| • Medicinal Herb                    | coins and a [MEDICINAL HERB]. Fly over
| • Moonwort Bulb                     | the river. This part of the village
'-------------------------------------' has a church and an inn. Enter the 
| AREA ENEMIES                        | southwest house and pick up all the
| ------------------------------------| horse manure there. You'll get your
| 001 Slime, 002 Cruelcumber,         | first Benevolessence here. Go to the
| 003 Teeny Sanguini, 004 Sacksquatch,| well in the east part. There's a blue
| 005 Batterfly, 006 Dracky,          | chest inside. These blue chests have
| 007 Bodkin Archer                   | random items in them, and respawn from
'-------------------------------------' time to time. So be sure to check them
                                        every once in a while. Talk to the 
little kid on this side of the village, and then press A on Ivor. Teach this
guy a lesson. There's a dog near that kid talked to before. Talk to it, and 
it'll lead you to [KEEPSAKE RING]. Talk to the old lady in the church, and 
give her ring back to obtain another Benevolessence. After exiting the church,
you'll notice it's already nighttime. Go east for a scene with Aquila, then 
further east and talk to the ghost. Tell him he's already dead, and you will
get the third Benevolessence. You'll be brought back to the Observatory.
Go to the tree of Yggdrasil and offer up the Benevolessences you've collected.
Now you'll watch the real introductory scene. It seems that you've fallen from
the heights down to Angel Falls again. Moreover, you've lost your wings and
halo and became a... normal person? Anyway, save at the church and check out
the shop, as you can buy items now.

'------------------------------------------------------------------------'

Enter the well again. The chest there has a [MEDICINAL HERB]. Go to the Mayors
house for a little scene. The wardrobe on the second floor contains [MOONWORT
BULB]. Go back to Erinn's house (the northeast one) and have a dinner there.
Speak with Ivor the next morning and he will join you as a pary member. You
can now finally leave the village. Talk to Hugo at the entrance and he'll let
you pass. On the world map, fight a few battles. Try to level up to at least
level 5. From Angel Falls it's a pretty straight path to the Mountain Pass.
Just follow the road and you'll get there.

==============================================================================
MOUNTAIN PASS............................................................WALK4
==============================================================================

.-------------------------------------. After the scene, open the chest with a
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | [GOLD RING] on your immediate right,
|-------------------------------------| then take the opposite path, and you
| • Gold Ring                         | will catch up to Ivor soon. After the
'-------------------------------------' conversation with Stornway soldiers,
                                        return to Angel Falls. Looks like we
will have to ask around about this Patty person. Simply go to Mayor's house
and watch the scene there. I guess it's time to travel to that infamous place
called Hexagon! Heal yourself, buy some healing items and exit the village.
The Hexagon is not too far away. Take the road to the Mountain Pass, and when
you reach the road sign, simply go south. The Hexagon is located a little bit
to the east, in the woods.

==============================================================================
THE HEXAGON..............................................................WALK5
==============================================================================

.-------------------------------------. Go north and enter the dungeon itself.
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | Run all the way north and read the
|-------------------------------------| stone inscription. Go back a little
| • Leather Shield                    | and try to examine the ghost, then
| • Feather Fan                       | follow it. Press the button on the
| • 210 Gold Coins                    | back of the statue and return to the
| • Seed of Deftness                  | center of the room. The path where the
| • Scale Armor*                      | inscription was is now open. Run east,
'-------------------------------------' then south to find a treasure chest
| ENEMIES                             | with [LEATHER SHIELD]. Then take the
| ------------------------------------| left stairway to find a blue chest.
| 006 Dracky, 007 Bodkin Archer,      | The right stairway will take you 
| 008 Bag o' Laughs, 009 Mecha-mynah, | further into the dungeon. Go north
| 010 Firespirit, 011 Spirit          | and take the stairway on top of the
'-------------------------------------' hexagonal structure to get to B2. Go
                                        northwest to find a chest with a
[FEATHER FAN]. Take the road south to find one more that contains [210 GOLD
COINS]. Finally, take the northeast stairway to B1. Make your way around this
room (keep in mind the that there's a blue chest in the west corner) and exit
through the north door. Take the path northwest for a chest with [SEED OF
DEFTNESS], then go up the stairs north and speak with the woman lying there.
Agree to free her legs, and prepare yourself for your first boss battle.

.------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Hexagoon                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 175 Exp. Points, 100 Gold Coins  |
| Drops: Magic Beast Hide                  |
'------------------------------------------'

This boss is not really that dangerous, even though your fighting him alone.
All he can do is ram you or throw some rocks at you that deal 7 or 8 HP dmg
depending on your current level. At level 7/8 he's a pushover, cause he only
has about 100 HP. Just don't forget to use Heal spell/Medicinal Herbs when
necessary.

*Note: To get the chest with [SCALE ARMOR], you'll have to enter the Hexagon
from the Stornway region. The entrance is in the southwest corner of the
Western Stornway.
After the scenes, return to Angel Falls. Head to the inn for a scene. After
that, talk to the ghost near Erinn's house for yet another interesting scene.
The Battle Records menu option now becomes available! Speak with the ghost
again and head to the inn. Don't enter it, run up the stairs near it instead.
Examine the bush to find an [INNY]. Show it to the ghost, then to Erinn inside
her house. After the conversation go right a bit for another scene.
After Erinn leaves for Stornway, we should head to the Mountain Pass again.
When you're there, examine the Starflight Express for a scene. The previously
blocked path is now open, by the way, so take it to arrive in the Western
Stornway region. The Stornway Castle is right here, in the middle of it.

.-------------------------------------. After the scene, talk to Erinn again.
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | Agree ti help her and leave the inn
|-------------------------------------| for now. Enter the nearby well and 
| • Linen Gloves                      | open the chest for [LINEN GLOVES].
| • Lump of Lambswool                 | There's an underground stairway just
| • Mini Medal                        | north of the well. Besides lots of
| • Seed of Strength                  | barrels and stuff, you'll find a blue
| • Mini Medal                        | and a red chest inside. The red one
'-------------------------------------' contains a [LUMP OF LAMBSWOOL]. Go
| AREA ENEMIES                        | back, and continue north to find yet
| ------------------------------------| another red chest with a [MINI MEDAL].
| 011 Spirit, 012 Winkster,           | Enter the weapon shop and you'll find
| 013 Hammerhood, 014 She-slime,      | two more chests - a blue one and a red
| 015 Funghoul, 016 Bubble Slime,     | one, that has [SEED OF STRENGTH] in
| 017 Wooper Trooper                  | it. Now return to the inn and speak to
'-------------------------------------' Erinn, Patty and Pavo (who is visible
                                        only to you, as he's a Celestrian).
Pavo offers some multiplayer services, while Erinn handles the inn management.
Talk to her if you need to rest. Patty helps you to recruit new characters.
You can recruit pre-made characters here, make your own, drop them off or even
delete them forever. Anyways, have fun, but be sure to create three more party
members with different classes. Try to make a Thief or Priest, preferably. 
After recruiting at least one member, Patty will teach you the Egg On move.Now
all you need to do is exit the castle and fight some battles to level up your
newly-created party a little bit. Level 7 or 8 for everyone should be enough,
not to mention that your Hero will be a few levels higher. If fighting enemies
in the Western Stornway region is too slow for you, you can try going north
and battling the monsters at the Zere region. They're not that hard, and give
more EXP points per battle. Also, try to get at least 2000-2500 gold coins to
update your equipment at the shops.
There's another thing I should mention here. From this point of the game, you
can talk to NPCs to trigger special quests. Soemtimes they may bring some good
and useful rewards. Just make sure to talk to everybody on your journey. For
the quest explanations and locations, look in the appropriate section of the
guide. Now, proceed to the Stornway Castle and talk to the guard on the right.
Say "Yes" to him and enter the castle. Take the narrow west hallway first, and
go downstairs to B1. There are two chests here in the east corner. Take note
of the locked one. We'll be able to unlock such chests soon enough.  The right
chest has a [MINI MEDAL] inside. Go back to L1 and take the central stairs. Go
north a bit for a scene. Talk to King Schott and say "yes" to him twice. Now
exit the castle for a scene with Stella. Looks like Loch Storn is our next
destination point. Exit Stornway and go north to Zere region.
**Note: If you enter Stornway during nighttime, you'll find a [MINI MEDAL] in
the northeast part of town (behind the church).
In Zere region, take the first road leading a bit northeast and you'll trigger
a scene. During the scene, choose to wait a bit longer when prompted.

.------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Wight Knight                      |
|------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 800 Exp. Points, 200 Gold Coins  |
| Drops: Iron Gauntlets                    |
'------------------------------------------'

If you have a full party or at least three members, this battle should be very
easy. All that Wight Knight can do is either a regular attack or a Bolt Cutter
attack, which is not very different from his regular attack. He can also heal
himself for about 35 HP, but that happens rarely. Attacking one after another
and multiplying the damage output is the key to quick victory here.

After Wight Knight apologises for his deeds, Stella decides to go and report
to the King about your victory. Leave Loch Storn and go back to Stornway. Talk
to King Schott and on your way back you'll run into Simona. Take the south 
door, and run northeast. Enter the room and talk to Simona there. She asks you
to go to the village of Zere and ask about Brigadoom there. Zere is situated
on the north coast of the Zere region (the village itself looks like a heart
on the world map).
*Note: If you talk to King Schott later in the game, he'll give you a treasure
map.

.-------------------------------------. Go into the cave and talk to the girl
| AREA ENEMIES                        | inside to learn the 'Cheer' Party
| ------------------------------------| Trick. Rest at the inn if you need,
| 016 Bubble Slime, 017 Wooper Trooper| and take note of the chest in the
| 018 Betterfly, 019 Meowgician,      | back room here. We'll come back for it
| 020 Ragged Reaper, 021 Gastropog,   | later. Take a round trip through the
| 022 Brownie, 023 Boppin' Badger,    | village and finally enter the eastmost
| 024 Drackmage, 025 Bodkin Fletcher  | house. Talk to Alanna to hear her
'-------------------------------------' nursery rhyme. You'll find out that
                                        you need to head north in order to 
learn more about this Brigadoom place. So basically all you need to do is head
further north to get to Doomingale Forest. The entrance to Brigadoom is 
situated in the center of this area (look for a darkened portion of the map).

==============================================================================

.-------------------------------------. Purple areas sap your HP, so don't
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | walk on them too long. First take the
|-------------------------------------| path to the west and enter the north-
| • Trailblazing Bandana              | western tower to find a blue chest. Go
| • Mini Medal                        | back and enter the eastern tower. Go
| • Clogs                             | up the stairs and open the chest with
| • Belle Cap                         | [TRAILBLAZING BANDANA] on top of it.
| • Gold Bracer                       | Exit the tower and go directly west to
'-------------------------------------' find one more blue chest. Finally, go
| ENEMIES                             | down the stairway in the northwest
| ------------------------------------| corner of this area. At B1, head north
| 027 Cumaulus , 028 Skeleton,        | and east, then take the upper east 
| 029 Healslime, 030 Blinkster,       | path that'll lead to two chests with
| 031 Leery Lout, 032 Lunatick        | [MINI MEDAL] and [CLOGS]. Now go back
'-------------------------------------' the way you came and head south. Keep
| AREA ENEMIES                        | on following the path until you get to
|-------------------------------------| a fork. The chest in the south has a
| 020 Ragged Reaper, 022 Brownie,     | [BELLE CAP]. Take the stairway in the
| 024 Drackmage, 025 Bodkin Fletcher, | west afterwards. On the next floor,
| 026 Ram Raider, 027 Cumaulus,       | go up again. On the upper level, check
| 028 Skeleton                        | the door to the south to unlock it and
'-------------------------------------' make a shortcut. Then proceed north to
                                        the stairway. On L2, take the nearby
stairs to L1. Read the notes on the table and open the chest that contains a
[GOLD BRACER]. Go back up and take the path south to the door in the center of
this room. Enter it for a scene. Heal up, and talk to Morag.

.------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Morag                             |
|------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 1600 Exp. Points, 350 Gold Coins |
| Drops: High Heels                        |
'------------------------------------------'

Morag is certainly not a difficult boss. Her regular attacks are weak, and if
you have a full party, you'll be doing like 10 more times damage than her per
round. She also has an HP Hoover attack that restores her HP a little, and a
Crack ice spell. Make sure to heal yourself if she ever uses it. She can also
become enraged and focus her attacks on one character. The last thing to note
is that Morag can do a weak hit-all attack that can paralyze your characters.
Use Moonwort Bulbs if needed. All in all, at level 12 or so, she's a pushover.

After the battle, speak with the Wight Knight to trigger a scene. After that,
talk to Simona and use Evac spell to get out of here. Now just go back to the
Stornway Castle (or use a Chimaera Wing item to teleport there). Talk to King
Schott in the castle and he'll thank you for your hard work. He'll also open
up the treasure room. Go behind his throne and up the stairs. Then follow the
path to the treasure. Open two blue chests and three red ones for [1000 GOLD
COINS], [AGRESSENCE] and [GOLD ROSARY]. Exit the castle. Before leaving, visit
the inn to finally gain access to the ALCHEMY POT!!! You will learn a few
useful recipes right away, and receive an Alchenomicon which you can access
from the Battle Records menu. Great. Now let's get back to the Starflight
Express, as Stella suggested. Return to the Mountain Pass, enter the Express
and after the scene, head to that northeastern checkpoint at Stornway King 
Schott mentioned. Go through to enter the Eastern Coffinwell region. The
Coffinwell town is right there, in the middle of it.

.-------------------------------------. Go up the first stairway you see and
| AREA ENEMIES                        | run across the bridge to the house on
|-------------------------------------| the right. Enter it, and examine the
| 030 Blinkster, 033 Leafy Larrikin,  | bookshelves to learn some alchemy
| 034 Clockwork Cuckoo, O35 Slugger,  | recipes. The northern house also has
| 036 Chariot Chappie, 037 Morphean   | some bookshelves, so examine them for
| Mushroom, 038 Lost Soul             | recipes. You should have loads of gold
'-------------------------------------' by now, so update your equipment. On
                                        the floor above the inn, there's a
magically locked door (similar to the one in Zere), so take note of it. There
is also a well, that has a locked jail cell. That's another thing to remember.
The house in the northwest also has some important recipes inside. Once you're
done with everything optional, enter the big mansion in above the inn. Talk to
the mayor on the second floor. Don't forget to check the bookshelves after the
conversation. Head into the northwest house again and talk to Catarrhina, Dr.
Phlegming's wife. Exit the house and go down the stairs, then a little bit
north. Talk to Catarrhina again. Enter the door. When inside, read all the
bookshelves to learn some new recipes and a new Party Trick, Provoke. Talk to
the doctor and report back to the mayor. He'll give you the [QUARANTOMB KEY].
Show it to Phlegming and he'll leave for Quarantomb. You should do the same,
obviously. From Coffinwell, go west to get to the Western Coffinwell region.
The Quarantomb dungeon is situated in the north of this region.

| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | proceed north. Go east right away and
|-------------------------------------| open the chest with [SLIPWEED]. Head
| • Slipweed                          | directly north, grabbing [MINI MEDAL]
| • Mini Medal                        | from the chest on your way, until you
| • Seed of Skill                     | get to the statue in the northwest
'-------------------------------------' corner. Press the button on it and
| ENEMIES                             | continue west. Open the chest that
| ------------------------------------| contains [SEED OF SKILL]. Check the
| 042 Mean Spirit, 043 Magus,         | statue in the northeast corner and
| 044 Mummy Boy, 045 Earthenwarrior,  | press the button here, too. That'll
| 046 Metal Slime                     | open the door in the center of this
'-------------------------------------' room. There is blue chest in the south
| AREA ENEMIES                        | area of the floor. So, approach the
|-------------------------------------| jar in the center of this floor for a
| 034 Clockwork Cuckoo, 035 Slugger,  | scene. After it, heal up and examine
| 036 Chariot Chappie, 037 Morphean   | the pink monster.
| Mushroom, 038 Lost Soul             |

This boss is a little bit different from the previous ones, as it acts twice
per turn. Still, if you're properly leveled, it's nothing to worry about. His
regular attack does between 10 to 25 damage, depending on the character. It
also may cause poison status. Counter it with Antidotal Herbs/Squelch spell.
He has two stat-decreasing spells - Deceratle (decreases agility) and Kasap
(decreases defense). You shouldn't have any buffing spells by now, unless you
are very overleveled, so I suggest just suck it up and fight the Contagion
that way. He doesn't have that much HP, after all.

The curse is lifted, everyone is saved, so we can safely return to Coffinwell.
Talk to the mayor first, then to Catalina... Oh dear. This shouldn't have
happened. After this letdown, go talk to the mayor near his mansion, then go
to the inn and choose to rest. In the evening, visit mayor at his library and
he'll reward you with a [FEATHER HEADBAND]. Go back to the churchyard and talk
to the ghost. Head to Phlegming's house and examine the door. After the scene,
the doctor will join you. Take him to the houses on the west and east side of
the town, and to the inn (make sure to check the second floor of the eastern
house). Talk to the people inside. Return to Phlegming's place. After the
scene, you'll find out that Coffinwel finally became lively and cheerful
again. Time to visit that Starflight Express in the Mountain Pass again. After
a little scene upon your arrival, enter the Express. Examine the control panel
and you'll fly back to the Observatory. After a lenghty series of scenes, you
will gain control of the Hero again. Go and save at the Prayer Room first.
Make your way to Yggdrasil on top of the Observatory and choose to offer a
prayer to trigger a sequence of scenes. The Hero will learn Zoom spell, which
is a very convenient spell. Attempt to leave the place to get another scene.
It seems we must collect the seven fyggs to restore peace in this world. Head
back to the Starflight Express. Inside, talk to Stella to descend to the
Protectorate again.
You'll arrive at the Newid Isle, a place where the famous Alltrades Abbey is
situated. To get there, simply head east and north. You can't miss it, it's
on the island in the middle of a lake.

'-------------------------------------' corner. On L4, go southwest to open a

| ------------------------------------| open the chest in the north with [1200
| 048 Slime Knight, 050 Badboon,      | GOLD COINS] and a blue chest in the
| 051 Slime Stack, 053 Mushroom Mage, | east. On L5, go northeast to find a
| 054 Drackyma, 055 Walking Corpse,   | chest with [IRON GAUNTLETS] and take
| 056 Jinkster, 057 Restless Armor    | the path up. On L7, open the southwest
'-------------------------------------' chest to find [MINI MEDAL], then
                                        the northeast one to get [MAGIC WATER]
and heal up. Enter the shining door. Talk to the man inside for a scene.

If you're around level 15-16 like me, get prepared for a pretty tough battle.
Not only this guy acts twice per turn, he has some nasty buffing skills such
as Buff (ups his defense). Usually he uses Buff once per two turns, raising
his defense so much that your weapons will be doing 10-20 damage only. He also
frequently drains magic of your characters. Although his most dangerous attack
is Woosh. It's a hit-all wind element spell that hits your characters for 35
or 40 HP if Master of Nu'un goes "haywire". Ouch. Sometimes he uses lightning
attacks, although they're a little less intimidating. Make sure you have lots
of healing items on your hands. Spells like Heal/Midheal are a must. If you
have a Priest, he might trigger his Coup de Grace move which'll be very useful
to your party if it's very low on HP. Anyway, use elemental spells like Crack,
Frizz, etc. Hopefully they'll hit the boss for 35 dmg at least. Multiplying
your damage is also useful here, especially if the boss acts before you.

After the battle, you'll obtain the first [FYGG] during the cutscene. Return
to Alltrades Abbey. Talk to Jack of Alltrades in the north. Talk to him again
to get the ability of changing vocations. Once you're done, leave the Abbey
and head south to Porth Llaffan.

Go to Mayor's house and read the books on the shelves to learn new recipes.
Take note of the locked chest here. If it's daytime, talk to the pink-haired
girl and then to mayor Bryce on the shore. Attempt to leave and you'll trigger
a scene. Go to the inn, and choose to rest. In the evening, go to Jona's house
and talk to her. Exit her house, talk to the ghost on the shore and go to the
mayor's house. After the scene, go to the west gate and talk to mayor's son.
Go through the gate. Follow the only path to Tywll Cave.

| • Seed of Magic                     | and enter the cave. Go north on the
| • Iron Kneecaps                     | rocks, then west to find a chest with

| 041 Crabid, 058 Knocktopus,         | south across the rocks, taking the 
| 059 Chimaera, 060 Salamarauder,     | southeast rock path after that. Go up
| 061 Man o' War, 062 Mortoad         | the stairs and enter the first hole
'-------------------------------------' you see. Head northeast for a chest
                                        with [SEED OF AGILITY]. Exit the room
and go through the west hole this time. Stick to the west side of the room to
get to a chest with a [MINI MEDAL]. Go back and head directly north, then east
and up the stairs leading to a chest with [???]. Now go back and make your way
to the east side of the room. There's a blue chest here, too. In the next room
you'll come to a fork. The west path leads to a chest with [BLUE JEANS], while
the east one leads to a jar with some item. Take the path north to Cuddiedig
Cliff. Go north for a scene. Heal up, and examine Lleviathan to trigger the
battle.

Surprisingly, this boss is much easier than the previous one. He attacks once
per turn (and here I thought all bosses starting from Nu'un will act twice),
and his moves are not that threatening. He has a regular physical attack and
a swipe attack that hits all party members. He can become enraged and focus
his attacks on a certain character. Other than that, he has high HP, so the
battle will take longer than expected. Try to Egg On a Warrior (if you have
him/her) with a your Hero a couple of times and deal some serious damage.

During the scene that follows, you'll obtain the second [FYGG]. Awesome. Back
in Porth Llaffan talk to Jona and then to the sailor on the ship. Choose to
depart for the eastern continent.

.-------------------------------------. If it's daytime, go directly east and
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | cross the bridge for a little scene.
|-------------------------------------| Now make your way to the northeastern
| • Seed of Sorcery                   | tent. Talk to the pirate near the pile
| • Mini Medal                        | of gold. Why, it's Cap'n Max Meddlin,
'-------------------------------------' the famous Mini Medal hunter! Turn in
| AREA ENEMIES                        | all your gathered Mini Medals here,
|-------------------------------------| and he'll reward you with some 
| 057 Restless Armor, 063 Dread       | fantastic items. He'll be giving you
| Admiral, 064 Zumeanie,              | rewards up to 80 medals, and after
| 067 Bewarewolf,  068 Clawcerer,     | he'll just give you some rare items
| 069 Rampage, 074 Toxic Zombie       | in exchange. So be sure to check the
'-------------------------------------' walkthrough and not miss any of the
                                        medals you can find in red chests,
although sometimes they can be found in blue ones. If you have at least four
medals (and you SHOULD have more than four), he'll give you a very important
item - the THIEF'S KEY!!! You can now go and open all those locked red chests
you've seen during your journey. Remember, once you collect a certain amount
of these medals, return to Dourbridge and give them to the captain. Open the
chest near him to find [SEED OF SORCERY] and unlock the other chest to get a
[MINI MEDAL]. Take note of the jail cell here, you'll need another key to open
it. While running around the town, speak with everyone you see. Go to the
northernmost house and talk to the man there. Open the blue chest and examine
the bookshelves. Go through the door behind the item shop to find another
bookshelf filled with recipes. Take note of the locked cell door that's barely
visible from where you stand. Leave Dourbridge via the west exit. You now have
two choices - either to continue to progress the storyline, or revisit all the
places that had locked chests in them. I say, let's do some treasure hunting.
Teleport to Stornway (use Zoom spell) and enter the castle. Take the northwest
stairs down to B1, and open the chest with a [CAUTERY SWORD]. Teleport to
Porth Llaffan and enter mayor's house. A chest there contains [PINK PEARL].
Teleport to Slurry Quay and open the chest with [AGILITY RING]. That's it for
now. To get to Bloomingdale, we need to exit Dourbridge from the east and
travel through the Lonely Plains. There is one particular place in the Lonely
Plains that might interest us. It's the Heights of Loneliness, situated on the
northern tip of the Lonely Plains region. Read the bookshelf inside the house
to learn a few new recipes. Exit this area to the north.

.-------------------------------------. As you enter, go west and climb the
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | ladder to reach a chest with [MINI
|-------------------------------------| MEDAL]. Take the east and exit this
| • Mini Medal                        | floor to the north. At L2 go northwest
| • Seed of Deftness                  | and climb the vine to open a blue
| • Kitty Litter                      | chest, then go further north and climb
| • Mini Medal                        | east of the two vines to grab a chest
'-------------------------------------' with [SEED OF DEFTNESS]. Take the
| ENEMIES                             | other vine and follow the path to L3.
| ------------------------------------| On this level, enter the first hole
| 071 Mad Moai, 073 Grinade,          | you reach and follow it to the end to
| 074 Toxic Zombie, 075 Metal Slime   | reach a chest with [KITTY LITTER].
| Knight, 076 Hocus Chimaera,         | Return to the lower part of L3 and 
| 077 Treeface, 078 Stone Golem       | make your way up. Climb the vine to
'-------------------------------------' find a chest that contains [MINI
| AREA ENEMIES                        | MEDAL]. Go east across the bridge,
|-------------------------------------| then across the vines to get to L6.
| 068 Clawcerer, 069 Rampage,         | From hthis point, it's pretty much a 
| 070 Beakon, 071 Mad Moai,           | straightforward path to the summit,
| 072 Trigertaur, 074 Toxic Zombie    | where Zere Rocks is situated. Don't
'-------------------------------------' forget to open a blue chest on L7. In
                                        Zere Rocks, enter the northeast house
and check the bookshelf in the north for alchemy recipes. After that, talk to
the slime inside. Exit the house to initiate a boss battle.

.-------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Garth Goyle                        |
|-------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 4134 Exp. Points, 1250 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Terrible Tattoo                    |
'-------------------------------------------'

Well, this boss battle isn't too hard, but it's very long and tedious, because
of Goyle's constant buffing. Basically, he starts a battle by casting Magic
Barrier (ups his resistance to magic) and Kabuff (ups his defense). He acts
twice per turn, and can do the same moves for two turns straight. His attack
are not really intimidating - he stomps a character (or the whole party) for
about 20-30 dmg or 45 dmg if he used Psyche Up beforehand. The main difficulty
here is dealing damage to him, because with double Kabuff, he's pretty much
invisible for a couple of turns. My advice would be to Egg On a Warrior with
your Hero to 100 tension and attack Garth Goyle when his Kabuff goes away.
Three or four of these attacks, and Goyle is no more. Also, the Terrible
Tattoo this guy drops is cursed and if you equip it, the only way you'll be
able to get rid of it is to go to a church and perform a benediction ritual.

After the battle, go down the stairs, and talk to the ghost. You'll obtain the
third [FYGG]. Exit Zere Rocks, and cast Evac to get out of here, and go to the
Bloomingdale region. Bloomingdale town is on the west part of it.

.-------------------------------------. Go to northeast corner and you'll spot
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | a well. There's a locked cell inside.
|-------------------------------------| We'll come back here later once we 
| • 1500 Gold Coins                   | have the key fr it. Head into the 
| • Strength Ring                     | house with the footwear merchant and
'-------------------------------------' examine the bookshelves. In the west
| AREA ENEMIES                        | part of town check the rightmost hut
|-------------------------------------| to find more recipes in bookshelves.
| 072 Trigertaur, 078 Stone Golem,    | Go to the port in northwest. The 
| 079 Gum Shield, 080 Pink Sanguini,  | building here is locked, and you'll
| 081 Scarewolf, 082 Big Badboon      | be able to enter it only after you've
| 090 King Slime, 093 Axolhotl        | beaten the game. Talk to the old man
'-------------------------------------' for a scene. Talk to the woman near
                                        the entrance. At daytime, go to the
mansion in the north. Speak with the guard and he'll let you enter it. Go to
the second floor and in the east room you'll find two chests with [1500 GOLD
COINS] and [STRENGTH RING] (the last one requires Thief's Key). There's also
a magic locked door here, but we don't have the key for it yet. Go back to the
first floor and enter the eastern room for a scene. Talk to Marion for another
scene and leave the manor. Enter the nearby house on the left and talk to the
woman there. Go to the house near the church, where the footwear shop is. Talk
to Randolph for a scene. After that, talk to the ghost and follow it through
the door. Check the south gravestone for a scene. Leave Bloomingdale and head
north to the Bad Cave.

.-------------------------------------. Go straight north in the opening. 
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | Follow the way up for a scene. Head
|-------------------------------------| further, check the sign and sit on a
| • Hephaestus' Flame                 | chair. After the scene, climb down the
| • Mini Medal                        | nearby ladder, go east and enter the
| • 1700 Gold Coins                   | hole. First off, go south and unlock
'-------------------------------------' the door. Then go northeast, opening
| ENEMIES                             | two blue chests on your way. Follow
|-------------------------------------| this narrow path, and take the right
| 083 Medislime, 084 Shaman,          | exit first. Open a chest that contains
| 085 Weaken Beakon, 086 Raving       | [HEPHAESTUS' FLAME]. Take the west 
| Lunatick, 087 Hunter Mech,          | exit then and follow the straight path
| 088 Riptide, 089 Metal Medley       | to B1, opening a blue chest on your
'-------------------------------------' way. Go north first, and open a chest
                                        with [MINI MEDAL]. Make your way to
the west part of this floor and go north to pick up [1700 GOLD COINS] from the
chest. There's also a blue chest in the middle of this floor. On B2, the blue
chest near the exit is a Cannibox. Also, on this floor you might run into some
Metal Medley enemies. Those are pretty rare, but each carries 12000+ EXP, and
tries to run away as fast as possible, so be sure to kill it quick with moves
like Metal Slash. They only have 5 HP, if I recall correctly. Proceed north
to the next screen. Heal up and talk to Marionette. After the scene, examine
the monster.

This boss is definitely easier to kill than Garth Goyle, but it also has some
nasty moves. The Venomissile attack hits all party members and may poison your
characters. The sticky web attack makes them unable to move for a turn or two.
Eerie Light makes them more succeptible to status ailments (i.e. poison), and
Wind Sickles is just a hit-all attack that does about 20-24 dmg. There is
really no strategy - just hit it till it dies and don't forget to heal your HP
and poisoning. Fly Swat may deal some extra damage, coupled with Egg On.

After the battle, examine Marionette's body for a scene. Cast Evac to get out
of here and return to Bloomingdale. Go to the mansion graveyard and examine
the doll to get fourth [FYGG]. Speak with the old man at the port for a scene.
You will finally acquire a ship. Few things to note: use the control pad to
steer the ship and press A to dock. Press B to get inside your ship. Search
every nook and cranny here to find some items in barrels, jars and wardrobes.
Search the bookshelf for some recipes. Take note of the jail cell with a
chest inside. Also, remember that you will encounter enemies when sailing,
and you won't be able to see them, so it's kind of a "random encounters are
back" thing for a while. Once you've got the hang of steering a ship, sail to
the continent north of Bloomingdale. There's a desert there, and in the middle
of this desert stands a town of Gleeba.

.-------------------------------------. Check the middle south house to find
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | a bookshelf with alchemy recipes. At
|-------------------------------------| daytime, go north and enter the Mirage
| • Magic Key                         | Mahal mansion. Enter the northwest 
'-------------------------------------' roomblock and check the bookshelves 
| AREA ENEMIES                        | for recipes and a new Party Trick -
|-------------------------------------| Salute. The northeast block has a lone
| 092 Shocktopus, 093 Axolhotl,       | bookshelf with alchemy recipes. On L2,
| 094 Parched Peckerel, 095 Power     | talk to the man walking near the lion

| 098 Mummy                           | help him. Exit Mirage Mahal and go in 
'-------------------------------------' the northwest corner of Gleeba. Use a
                                        "Clap" Party Trick near the tree in 
the shade for a scene. The lizard will start running around. Press A near it
to catch it. Show it to the chancellor on L2. After the scene, get down to L1
and talk to the soldier guarding the bathroom. Go south and talk to the woman
there. Head to the roof. Run around the oval structure and enter it from the
north side (not visible to you). You'll find a chest with [MAGIC KEY]!!! Looks
like now we can open all those locked magic doors (they're purple). On the 
roof, talk to the man sitting on the fountain. After that examine the fountain
and drop down to the bathroom. After the scene, enter the nearby well.

.-------------------------------------. Go directly north through the door,
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | and past the next room, go east across
|-------------------------------------| the bridge and down the stairs. Talk 
| • Mythril Ore                       | to the ghost, check the bookshelf and
| • Enchanted Stone                   | exit south. Go north to find a blue
| • Mini Medal                        | chest, and open the magic door with
| • Magic Shield                      | your new key. All jail cells here are
'-------------------------------------' locked and require yet another key, so
| ENEMIES                             | go down the stairs on the left. At B2,
|-------------------------------------| there's a chest with [MYTHRIL ORE] in
| 098 Mummy, 099 Admirer,             | the north. Go all the way back to the
| 100 Lesionnaire, 101 Diethon,       | magic door and head south. Go down the
| 102 Purresdigitator, 103 Manguini,  | little stairs and you'll find a chest
| 111 Ghoul                           | with [ENCHANTED STONE]. Make your way
'-------------------------------------' to the northwest stairs leading to B2.
                                        Go north and follow the curvy path
around this floor to the north exit. Grab the items from the two blue chests
in the east, a [MINI MEDAL] from northwest chest and [MAGIC SHIELD] from the
northern chest. At B3, examine the creature in the northwest corner.

Another not-so-hard boss, which basically only uses Fire Breath all the time
that does around 20 dmg to the whole party. He acts once per turn. He also
occasionally does Intimidating Scream, but it fails most of the time. Other
than that, the one thing that may be pretty dangerous is when he starts doing
regular attacks that deal around 60-80 dmg to single character. Be on your
guard and heal accordingly, and you'll be fine. Use Dragon Slash for quicker
victory.

After the scene, you'll obtain the fifth [FYGG]. Now that we're back in the
town of Gleeba again, go to the queen's bathroom and check the waterfall on
the left. You'll get an exclamation mark, so press A to find a [DANGEROUS
BIKINI TOP]. I would like you to travel to some previously visited places
and unlock those magic doors. So, teleport to Zere, and enter the inn from the
back. You'll find a chest with [MINI MEDAL]. Teleport to Coffinwell and go
to the floor above the inn. Open the door here, and grab the mighty [SPIKED
ARMOR] from the chest. Check the bookshelf to find LOTS of new recipes. 
Teleport to Bloomingdale and enter the northern mansion. Go to the second
floor and open the door in the northwest. You'll find a chest with [MAGICAL
ROBES] inside. To progress the story, let's return to our ship and sail north
from Gleeba. Dock at the Urdus Marshland. Go northwest to arrive to the
Iluugazar Plains. The village of Batsureg lies in the middle of these plains.

for a scene, then enter the south yurt and talk to Batzorig inside. Exit this
area and go north to the Mt Ulbaruun to spot Batzorig. Follow him into a cave
in the southwest. After the scene, talk to the ghost. You need to travel to
Gerzuun, a village to the east. Exit the Mt Ulbaruun region to the east and
follow the road in the Mt Ulzuun region to enter Gerzuun.

|-------------------------------------| downstairs to B1 first (the stairs are

'-------------------------------------' blue chest. Go back and enter the tent
| ENEMIES                             | that is nearby to find a chest with

'-------------------------------------' for a chest containing [SLIME CROWN],
| AREA ENEMIES                        | southeast for another blue chest (see
|-------------------------------------| one more blue chest down there? you'll
| 111 Ghoul, 116 Rockbomb, 117 Brainy | have to backtrack a bit to get it).
| Badboon, 118 Drackal, 119 Gruffon,  | Finally, the northeast chest contains

                                        ghosts of this ruined village. Follow
the way to the spring and pick up some [BODURA GRASS]. Cast Evac and get back
to Hunter's Yurts. Talk to Batzorig in the south yurt for a scene. Return to
Batsureg. Rest at the inn and save your game. Approach the hill in the middle
of Batsureg for a scene.

This boss is another hard-to-kill because of his constant usage of the Dazzle
spell. It makes your characters hallucinate and miss their attacks. Casting
offensive spells is also not really useful here, because of her Magic Barrier.
Her regular attack deal around 40 dmg and drain your HP. She can rarely use a
knockdown attack. The most damaging spell would be Boom that deals 35-50 dmg
to the whole party. This battle is not really hard, just tedious, so remember
to heal when needed and use chained attacks to take the beast down.

After the battle, you'll obtain the sixth [FYGG]. In the morning, exit the inn
for a scene. Leave Batsureg and go to Bayarmaa's Grave again. After the scene,
you'll obtain a free [SPIRIT BRACER]. Return to Urdus Marshland. Travel east
through Hermany region to get to the Snowberian Coast. From there, it's a
straight path north to the Snowberia region, and its capital, the Swinedimples
Academy.

| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | a lenghty introduction you'll obtain
|-------------------------------------| 2000 gold coins and a [SWINEDIMPLES
| • Red Tights                        | BLAZER] from him. Check this floor for
'-------------------------------------' new alchemy recipes and open the magic
| AREA ENEMIES                        | door to find a chest with [RED TIGHTS]
|-------------------------------------| inside. Leave the building and enter
| 125 Shivery Shrubbery, 126 Tearwolf,| the dormitory on the east side of the
| 127 Brrearthenwarrior,              | academy. On L2, eavesdrop on some
| 128 Apeckalypse, 129 Great Gruffon, | students talking. Enter their room for
| 130 White Trigertaur,               | a quick scene. Exit the dorm and go
| 131 Sootheslime, 132 Icikiller,     | behind the western house. Talk to Fred
| 136 Sculptrice, 137 Handsome Crab   | there. Go back to the dorm and rest in
'-------------------------------------' your room (where the three boys were).
                                        At night, head to the main building,
and go all the way up to the balcony. Examine the statue and its forehead for
a scene. Exit the building and go northeast. Enter the underground school.

==============================================================================

.-------------------------------------. Go in the first door to the left and
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | head northwest. Ascend the pile of
|-------------------------------------| books and go south for a blue chest,
| • Seed of Therapeusis               | then directly north and west. Climb
| • Brainy Bracer                     | down the ladder and make your way
| • Einhander                         | across the poison puddle to the chest
'-------------------------------------' with [BRAINY BRACER]. Go back on the
| ENEMIES                             | bookshelves and continue going west,
|-------------------------------------| then south for a chest with [SEED OF
| 131 Sootheslime, 133 Teaky Mask,    | THERAPEUSIS]. Head to the exit in the
| 134 Raving Reaper, 135 Wight Priest,| northeast. Examine the bookshelves in
| 136 Sculptrice                      | the north part of B2, and open the
'-------------------------------------' chest with [EINHANDER] in the center
                                        of this room. The exit is in the south
end. Heal up, and enter the classroom. Talk to the ghost.

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Dreadmaster                         |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 10000 Exp. Points, 2550 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Sage's Elixir                       |
'--------------------------------------------'

The Dreadmaster uses physical attacks or Crackle (hit-all ice spell), for
about 40 dmg. He occasionally uses Double Trouble too, which is pretty much
like his ohysical attack. Zammle does about 45 dmg to one character. He may
Psyche Up himself (sometimes even twice in a row) and deal about 100 dmg to a
single character. Similar to the previous boss battle, this one is boring too.
It's pretty much the "attack-attack-heal when low on HP" kind of thing. Yawn.

You'll obtain the seventh and final [FYGG] after the battle. The Headmaster
will congratulate you on your success and reward with some more money. You can
now leave Academy and return to the tree that transports you to Observatory.
It's near the Alltrades Abbey, if you forgot. One more interesting thing: if
you come back to the Academy, you'll see a scene where the real investigator
is being thrown out by the guards. Now that's funny. Inside the Starflight,
talk to Stella and choose to depart for Observatory. During the scene, hand
over the fyggs to Aquila. I know you don't want to, but you'll have to...
A battle against him will commence. Attack him a few times to end the battle.
After another interesting scene, you'll end up in the middle of nowhere again.
This time, in Wormwood Creek, to be exact.

.-------------------------------------. Go north to the inn. Open the chest
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | behind the counter for [MINI MEDAL].
|-------------------------------------| Choose to rest here. At night, go to
| • Mini Medal                        | the item shop on the right, check the
| • Mini Medal                        | bookshelf and open a blue chest. Enter
| • Terrible Tattoo                   | the equipment shop and open the chests
'-------------------------------------' containing [MINI MEDAL] and [TERRIBLE
| AREA ENEMIES                        | TATTOO]. Enter the southeast house and
|-------------------------------------| examine the bookshelf. Finally, enter
| 139 Grim Grinner, 140 Sluggernaut,  | the church and talk to the balding man
| 141 Splatterhorn, 142 Whirly Girly, | inside. After the scene, check the
| 143 Gramarye Gruffon, 144 Skeleton  | bookshelf for recipes in the northwest
| Soldier                             | corner. Exit the village and go north.
'-------------------------------------' Cross the bridge to the east side, and
                                        head north to find a hidden cave. Find
a hole there and squeeze through it. Open the chest with [LUCIDA SHARD]. Then
talk to Wallace. Exit this room for a scene. Return to Wormwood Creek, and
examine the statue behind the weapon shop for a scene. Go to the church, and
investigate the stone in the northeast corner. You'll obtain [SERENE NECKLACE]
here. Now go back to the cave and show it to Serena. Exit the cave and head to
the Western Wormwood. You'll find the Bowhole dungeon on the northwestern tip
of it.

==============================================================================
THE BOWHOLE.............................................................WALK27
==============================================================================

.-------------------------------------. First off, go east to find three blue
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | chests, then head west and north to
|-------------------------------------| find Serena standing near the entrance
| • Mini Medal                        | to the dungeon. Talk to her, and she
| • Prayer Ring                       | will remove the barrier. Head inside
| • 3000 Gold Coins                   | and talk to the ghost to learn a new
| • Holy Talisman                     | Party Trick - Weird Dance. Drop into
| • Light Gauntlets                   | the middle hole. Go to the northwest
| • Gold Bar                          | corner and open a blue chest and a red
'-------------------------------------' chest with [MINI MEDAL]. Proceed south
| ENEMIES                             | and pick up a blue chest in the south-
|-------------------------------------| west corner. Keep going east, take a
| 144 Skeleton Soldier, 145 Bloody    | [PRAYER RING] from the north chest,
| Manguini, 146 Bloody Mummy,         | and continue east all the way to a
| 147 Harmour, 148 Python Priest,     | chest with [3000 GOLD COINS]. Take the
| 149 Sculpture Vulture, 150 Living   | nearby stairs and unlock the door to
| Statue, 151 Goodybag,               | make a shortcut. Back at B1, go west
| 152 Drakularge, 153 Liquid Metal    | and north all the way to northeastern
| Slime                               | stairway. Don't forget to open a door
'-------------------------------------' on the east side of the floor to make
| AREA ENEMIES                        | another shortcut. At B2, go north for
|-------------------------------------| a chest with [HOLY TALISMAN], and open
| 139 Grim Grinner, 141 Splatterhorn, | the blue chest in the northwest. Go
| 142 Whirly Girly, 143 Gramarye      | southeast to open a chest with [LIGHT
| Gruffon, 144 Skeleton Soldier,      | GAUNTLETS] and another blue chest.
| 145 Bloody Manguini, 147 Harmour    | Finally, take the southwest exit to
'-------------------------------------' B3. In here, go north for a blue chest
                                        and contine east, then south until you
hit a corner. Turn west from here to find a chest that contains [GOLD BAR].
Then take the middle path across the room which leads to B4. Also, on B3 you
can encounter Liquid Metal Slime enemies, which are awesome for farming EXP.
One Liquid Metal Slime carries 40000 EXP, so make yourself a favor and spend
some time on this floor killing slimes (if you're underleveled). You should
be at least level 33 before the next boss. Liquids are similar to ordinary
Metal Slimes, and run away when they see you, so be sure to approach them from
behind. Anyway, on B4 head directly north into the building. Heal up and
examine the stone statue.

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Gadrongo                            |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 12500 Exp. Points, 3050 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Ethereal Stone                      |
'--------------------------------------------'

Gadrongo might not seem like a particularly hard boss, but in fact, he is. He
starts off the battle with weak physical attacks, and then moves on to Ground
Pound which deals about 50 dmg to the whole party or attacks a single party
member for about 200 dmg. If you're unlucky, he may do this twice or thrice in
a row. The good news is that he acts only once per turn. He also has the
Burning Breath attack, but uses it rarely. Try to kill him as fast as you can,
leaving only one party member to heal everyone. If things go bad, other guys
should help out with healing items. Critical hits should do the job faster,
as well as beast-damaging abilities.

After the battle, examine the pedestal and take [WYRMLIGHT BOW] from it. Go
back to the Wormwood Creek and cross the bridge that's opposite of it. In the
canyon, step on the panel and fire the arrow for a scene. After it, cross the
bridge of light, and enter the Wyrm "body" region. It consists of multiple
smaller regions (like Wyrmtail, Wyrmwing, Wyrmmaw, etc.), which are situated
like a spiral. Travel through all of them to reach the center and the town on
the volcano, the Upover.

'--------------------------------------------'

Greygnarl is pretty easy if you have at least two characters with Dragon Slash
and heal properly. His regular attack is weak, and besides that, he can launch
a fire-based attack on the whole party for about 35 dmg and the Blinding Light
attack that hits all party members for about 65-70 dmg. If you heal when you
need and keep attacking, Greygnarl will fall in no time.

After the battle, attempt to leave the battlefield for a quick scene. Teleport
back to Upover only to discover that someone attacked the town. Heal up and
talk to the knight in purple armor. You'll fight a battle against a Fright
Knight and two Stenchurions. Watch the scene, and Upover will be free again.
Go up the stairs leading to the entrance of the Magmaroo and talk to the old
woman there. Head left and down the stairs. Talk to the man in the brewery to
obtain a keg of [DRUNKEN DRAGON]. Teleport to Stornway and drop your party
members off at the inn. Go back to Upover, talk to the old woman and use Zoom
to get to the summit. Talk to Greygnarl to receive [GITTISH SEAL]. Examine the
beast and you'll fight Aggrosculpture. Equip the Dragon Warrior armor set the
dragon gave you and talk to him again. After an epic scene, you'll end up in
Gortress, as a prisoner.

'-------------------------------------' Visit the graveyard, examine the

soldier in the east corner and to the left soldier in the south corner of the
map. After you're done with sightseeing, talk to Sterling. The next day,
approach the gallows for a scene. Equip yourself and run to the north. Enter
the watchtower and examine the soldier near the switch on L2. Defeat the 
Lethal Armor. It's pretty strong, so use your most powerful attacks to take it
out, and spells like Kaswoosh, Kafrizzle (if you have them). If you can't
deal with him yourself, teleport to Stornway and pick up your characters.
After the battle, stop the generator. Exit the watchtower for a scene. Save
your game and exit the Gortress. Teleport to Stornway and recruit your party
members again. Go back to the Gortress and head inside the lower door of the
tower. Step into the blue circle if you need healing, and go down the stairs.
Check the nearby bookshelves for new recipes and open the central door. Talk
to Goreham-Hogg for a scene.

This boss uses nothing but physical attacks, so proper defense value will save
you a lot of trouble. Keep the Dragon Warrior armor on your hero, and upgrade
the equipment of your other characters, so that their defense would be at
least 180-190. Hogg uses two types of Chain Swing: one vertical (hits a single
character for about 60 dmg, high possibility of a critical for about 170 dmg),
and one horizontal (hits the whole party for about 70 dmg). He can also Psyche
Up himself to raise the attack, but that happens not too often. Since his HP
is pretty low, this shouldn't be a tough battle if you keep your characters'
HP in proper condition and use abilities like Falcon Slash/Miracle Slash.

After the battle, open the chest to acquire the [ULTIMATE KEY]. Yes, it's the
key that will open all those locked jail cells all around the world. Go down
the stairs and approach Sterling for a scene. Unlock all doors and release all
celestrians. Talk to Sterling again. You'll fly to the Observatory. 
In Observatory, go to L2 and unlock the door in the northeast corner. Open the
chests for [GODDESS RING] and [ORICHALCUM]. After that, talk to Apus Major in
the north part of this room. In the L1-L2 area, take [50 GOLD COINS] and [HOLY
WATER] from the chests on the west side, and a [WAKEROBIN] from the chest on
the east side. Go up to L4 and talk to Apus Major again. Head into the Express
and talk to Sterling.

choose to go to Alltrades Abbey. We'll start opening those locked jail cells
now.

Teleport to Dourbridge and cross the bridge. Go down the ladder and stand

Once you're done shopping, enter the northeast tent and open the jail cell to
find 5 chests with [3000 GOLD COINS], [MINI MEDAL], [DEMON WHIP], [SAINT'S

1. Stornway Castle - locked prison on B1. Nothing special;
2. Coffinwell - locked jail cell in the well (there's a quest request inside);
3. Bloomingdale - northeast well, [MAYORESS'S MITTENS];
4. Inside your ship - [SEED OF AGILITY], [FALCON BLADE];
5. The Plumbed Depths - B1, [SAINT'S ASHES];
6. Gerzuun - B1, [THUG'S MUG].
If you can't find some of the treasures, check the respective sections of this
guide.
Once you're done collecting the treasure, teleport to Gittish Empire region
(or go there with the help of Starflight Express) and approach the castle in
the middle of it.

GITTINGHAM PALACE.......................................................WALK32

Enter the palace, and Lieutant Hootingham-Gore will give you a warm welcome.

| Reward: 18500 Exp. Points, 4050 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Sage's Elixir                       |
'--------------------------------------------'

Obviously, you should take out the Karmours first. They're annoying, and can
sometimes protect Gore from your attacks. When the boss is left alone, he is
pathetically easy, as all he can do are Fuddle/Eerie Glow spells that almost
never work and weak Swoosh/Frizzle elemental spells. Don't use magic on him,
as his resistance is high and he frequently casts Bounce on himself. Physical
attack do the job fine. Don't get cocky, though, as the next bosses will be
much harder.

.-------------------------------------. In L1 South, take the path west. Keep
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | going all the way up to the roof and
|-------------------------------------| pick up the [MINI MEDAL] to the left
| • Mini Medal                        | of the entrance to the palace. Cast
| • Mini Medal                        | Evac and enter L1 South again. Take
| • Reckless Necklace                 | the east path this time. In L1 East,
| • Mini Medal                        | open two chests with [MINI MEDAL] and
| • Celestial Spear                   | [RECKLESS NECKLACE]. Ignore the west
| • 5000 Gold Coins                   | door for now and exit northwest. Go
| • Seed of Deftness                  | northwest to find six treasure chests:
| • Dark Shield                       | three blue chest and three red ones
| • Seed of Skill                     | that contain [MINI MEDAL], [CELESTIAL
| • Mini Medal                        | SPEAR] and [5000 GOLD COINS]. Go back
'-------------------------------------' to L1 East and enter the west door.
| ENEMIES                             | Proceed southwest and enter the door.
|-------------------------------------| You'll find a chest with [SEED OF
| 171 Stenchurion, 173 Dark Skeleton, | DEFTNESS] there. Head out and further
| 174 Killing Machine, 176 Lethal     | west is another door. Go northwest and
| 177 Freezing Fog, 178 Stone         | open a chest with [DARK SHIELD]. Make
| Guardian, 179 Boss Troll,           | your way to the healing circle and the
| 180 Blastoad, 181 Fright Knight,    | stairway. From L2, take the nearby
| 182 Wight King                      | stairs to L3 and examine the bookshelf
'-------------------------------------' there. Back at L2, check the bookshelf
| AREA ENEMIES                        | in northwest corner and exit the room
|-------------------------------------| to the east. On the outskirts of the
| 171 Stenchurion, 172 Gloomy         | palace, go north to a chest with [SEED
| Gastropog, 173 Dark Skeleton,       | OF SKILL]. Proceed south and west to
| 174 Killing Machine, 175 Dreadful   | the central door. On L3, go east to
| Drackal, 176 Lethal Armor,          | find a blue chest and a red chest with
| 177 Freezing Fog, 178 Stone         | [MINI MEDAL]. Take whichever exit you
| Guardian                            | want, heal up and ascend the stairs.
'-------------------------------------' Talk to another Gittish Lieutenant.

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Goresby-Purrvis                     |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 20000 Exp. Points, 4550 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Fizzle Foil                         |
'--------------------------------------------'

This Lieutenant is far more difficult than the previous one. Similarly to Hogg
this guy uses only physical sword attacks. His Multislash deals around 60 dmg
to the whole party, but hits random characters. The Upward Slice is the most
dangerous attack - it can knock a character down and has a high chance to do
a critical hit, and that's about 220 dmg to a single character. He also has
moves like Flame Slash and Kacrackle Slash but uses them rarely. If you have
a party with good armors, you shouldn't worry too much about Multislash or
other attacks, as your Priest/Sage should use Multiheal every second turn.
Things can get ugly if Purrvis starts to take your characters out with crits
every turn. Make good use of Zing (or Kazing, if you have it) here. If you're
lucky enough, you can score a few criticals on him, too. Simply keep attacking
him with your most powerful abilities, and he'll go down sooner or later.
High resilience value also plays an important role in this fight, and thief
or paladin vocations have plenty of it.

After the scene, go through the door. Make sure your characters have some 
Sage's Elixirs with them. Heal up, and talk to Godwyn.

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - King Godwyn                         |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: Nothing                            |
| Drops: Nothing                             |
'--------------------------------------------'

Godwyn's first form is laughably easy. All he uses is the Kafrizz spell, and
a ball fling attack. Just remember to heal when needed and you'll do fine.

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - King Godwyn                         |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 26500 Exp. Points, 6000 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Sceptre of Gitt                     |
'--------------------------------------------'

Okay, the second round of this battle is much harder. First of all, don't you
bother with those Oomph, Buff and Accelerate spells as Godwyn uses Disruptive
Wave to erase them. He relies only on fire magic, Kafrizz and the Inferno 
spell that does around 65 dmg to the whole party. This would've been easy, but
he attacks twice per turn making it very hard to heal inbetween the attacks
and deal some damage to himself, too. His regular attack is fairly damaging
too, so your main priority in this fight should be not losing party members,
because if you Zing-ing them back to life, Godwyn might finish you off easily.
After you've depleted his HP by a half, he starts using Magic Barrier and
Kabuff. Don't bother with spells, Sap him a couple of times instead. Use only
the mightiest attacks and throw in some Sage's Elixirs to replenish your MP,
because it tends to run out very quickly in this battle.

After the battle, get down to L2, and you'll see that the door in the north
is not blocked anymore. Go downstairs, save your game by talking to the ghost
priest and enter...

.-------------------------------------. B1 is very small and straightforward,
| ITEM CHECKLIST                      | so follow the only path there is to 
|-------------------------------------| B2. On B2, go directly east through a
| • Battler's Bracers                 | secret tunnel to reach two chests with
| • Mini Medal                        | [BATTLER'S BRACERS] and [MINI MEDAL].
'-------------------------------------' After that, go to the southwest corner
| ENEMIES                             | to find a stairway to B3. At B3, check
|-------------------------------------| the bookshelves for recipes. Unlock
| 179 Boss Troll, 181 Fright Knight,  | all the cells and relese celestrian
| 182 Wight King, 183 Claws,          | prisoners. Proceed northeast to B4. B4
| 184 Aggrosculpture, 185 Mandrake    | is also pretty straightforward, so
| Marshal, 186 Bad Karmour,           | make your way to B5. Follow the curvy
| 187 Wyrtoise, 188 King Crab         | path through B5, and continue going
'-------------------------------------' deeper and deeper to the end of B6.
                                        Grab a blue chest on your way. Unlock
the door, and talk to the captive. Release him, and he'll... attack you. This
is a battle you can't win, so either defend or attack the creature, it doesn't
matter. After the sequence of scenes, you'll be back in the Observatory. Go up
and approach Yggdrasil one more time. You'll obtain a [FYGG]. Go to Starflight
Express and talk to Sterling. Eat the fygg. Talk to Sterling and choose the
direction you want to go. If you have some unfinished business on the mainland
or if you're severely underleveled, go to the Alltrades Abbey or Gittingham
Palace. If you think you are ready, choose to go to the Realm of the Almighty,
the final dungeon in the main story.

| 193 Belisha Beakon, 194 Charmour,   | forget there's a blue chest in the

| 197 Cobra Cardinal, 198 Prism       | and take the southeast exit to a chest

| 200 Drakulard, 201 Barbatos,        | heal up and go through the middle door
| 202 Firn Fiend, 203 Sick Trigertaur | to speak with Goreham-Hogg. Defeat him
'-------------------------------------' for good this time. I won't go into
                                        details, because this fight is exactly
the same as the Gortress one. Go back a bit, head west, open the chest for
[MINI MEDAL]. Go up the southwest stairs. On L4, go north and east to another
stairway. On L3 again, go south and unlock the door. Then go northeast and
open the blue chest. Go back to L4 and take the south exit. Go west over the
bridge of light to a blue chest. Return to the place where you battle Goreham-
Hogg and take the stairway up. On L5, take the bridge east, then south, then
south again for a chest with [RUBY OF PROTECTION]. Go back to northeast island
and take the lower west bridge, then take lower east bridge. Follow the only
path to the south island. Take the north bridge to a blue chest, then take the
south bridge to another floor. Go east over the bridge, and climb the long
vine down to the first level of the dungeon. Open the chest for [SEED OF LIFE]
and go into the door with purple light. Open the blue chest and unlock the
door. Go back to the vine, climb it up, and go west. Enter the upper door. On
L6, take the left south exit first. Climb the vine to open a blue chest. Go
back to L6. Head north and in the northwest corner, go east through the cells
to find a blue chest and a red chest with [SEED OF THERAPEUSIS]. Take the
northeast exit. Go up the bridge of light to L8, heal up and talk to another
enemy - Hootingham-Gore. Defeat him, he's easy like the last time, and he
doesn't even have his minions around to help him. Take the east exit. Head
east and down the stairs. Pick up [RUSTY SWORD] from the chest and go back to
L8. Take the west exit. Follow the curvy path to L9. Go up the stairs to find
[SPELLWARD CIRCLET] in a chest. Exit south. Go east and into the east door. On
L9, climb the ladder up. Take the north exit out of L10. Jump into the wind
stream. Go east for a chest with [ELFIN ELIXIR]. Heal up, and talk to Goresby-
Purrvis. After defeating him, go up the bridge of light, and enter the palace.
Take whichever stairway up you want, and enter the central door. Heal up and
talk to Corvus.

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Corvus                              |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 28500 Exp. Points                  |
| Drops: Nothing                             |
'--------------------------------------------'

The first battle against Corvus is not as difficult as I expected it to be,
honestly. Obviously, he attacks twice per turn, but the majority of his spells
and attacks just can't... deal enough damage to have you worried. First of
all, he uses Psyche Up frequently, and sometimes, even twice in a row. THAT'S
where you have to be on your guard. Defend with inferior characters if you
want to avoid unnecessary risk. His regular attack does about 40 dmg to one
character. The lightning attack does about the same amount of damage to all
characters (much more if he used Psyche Up beforehand). Sometimes he flies up
in the sky and does a sky drop for about 100 dmg to a single character. And
finally, he can use Kaswoosh that hits all party members for 100-150 dmg,
depending on his level of tension. Oh, sometimes, if you're lucky, Corvus will
waste one of his moves on laughter. Basically, this fight is not too hard, you
just have to predict his tension attacks and defend. Multiheal should be your
best friend. As always, use Slash abilities to the fullest, and try not to
get ahead of yourself - better safe than sorry. Psyching Up/Egging On helps a
lot in this fight. Corvus doesn't have that much of HP, but it's probably
because it's not the REAL end yet...

After the battle, go back and exit the palace. You'll drop down to a level
below. Go north and examine the red orb.

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Barbarus                            |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 32500 Exp. Points                  |
| Drops: Yggdrasil Leaf                      |
'--------------------------------------------'

For a pre-final boss, Barbarus isn't all that hard. His attacks are pretty
weak. His regular attack does about 45 dmg to a single character, and his Claw
Slash does about 80 dmg. Cloud of Malevolent Darkness hits all party members
for about 50 dmg. He also uses the Kazam spell for about 60 dmg to a single
ally, and Wave of Panic which has a pretty low chance of decreasing your
characters' defense and agility. Barbarus has low HP, so killing him won't
take too long, if you're well leveled (about 41-43) and use Multiheal or other
healing spells/items when needed. There's really no strategy cause Barbarus is
really really easy, just a warm up before the final boss. If you're having
trouble with him, consider doing some serious leveling.

After the battle, heal up, restore your MP, and fill the items slots of your
characters with HP/MP replenishing items and maybe some Moonwort Bulbs. When
ready, examine the orb again for a scene.

.--------------------------------------------.
| FINAL BOSS - Corvus                        |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 40000 Exp. Points                  |
| Drops: Nothing                             |
'--------------------------------------------'

Corvus is the final boss of the game's main story. Well, he certainly is a tad
harder than he was before. Most likely, his difficulty would depend on your
levels, vocations and equipment, but I just want to say that all my characters
were at level 45 during this battle, and my weapons were basically Miracle
Swords with some other weapon equipped on my Priest. You may want to use a 
Paladin or an Armamentalist in this battle, as thy would be helpful, and of 
course you HAVE to have soemone with Multiheal or even better, Omniheal. The
boss has a few spells and abilities from the last battle - like Kafrizz that
does about 100 dmg to one character and Sky Drop. Protection from breath-based
attack should come in handy here, as Corvus has Chilly Breath that hits the
whole party for about 70 dmg and Burning Breath that may paralyze your allies.
You can use skills like Kabuff or Oomph at the start of battle, but later
Corvus will start doing Disruptive Wave to erase th effects of these spells.
His other attack include Combo Attack that hits random characters for random
damage, and a Bolt attack that hits the whole party for about 75 dmg. He also
uses Eye Gleam rarely to put a single party member to sleep. Now, in the end
of the battle he can also use Meditate to restore 500 HP to himself and Pray
to restore his MP completely. He also frequently starts using Psyche Up to
boost his damage. Now, the most intimidating spell he has is Magic Burst, that
hits your whole party for about 175 dmg, and even more if you're unlucky and
Corvus Psyched Up beforehand. That's where Multiheal comes in handy. You 
should never let him kill any of your characters, because then it's just gonna
get much harder. Moves like Falcon Slash or Warrior's Attack Attacker should
be of great help to you. After you feel you've depleted Corvus' HP by half at
least, you try to use Magic Barrier to survive Magic Burst if he pulls it off.

Well, you've just defeated Corvus and completed the main story of Dragon Quest
IX. Sit back and enjoy the ending, it's not very long. Make sure to save your
game when prompted. There's still lots of stuff to do here, and the real
challenges still await you. You can now start doing quests, acquiring new
vocations, hunting for treasure maps and even get a whistle that summons the
Starflight Express and lets you fly all over the world map to reach high areas
that you couldn't reach before! For now,

                                Congratulations!

POST-GAME...............................................................WALK35
==============================================================================

Okay, you've beaten the final boss, so save your game. The save file will now
have a star attached to the "Adventure Log". So, what doe we do now? Well,
basically level grinding, treasure map hunting, grotto exploring, equipment
gathering, Legacy Bosses slaughtering. But, before we get to all the secret
stuff, we'll have to do one necessary thing - retrieve the Starflight Express.

==============================================================================
RETRIEVING THE STARFLIGHT EXPRESS.......................................WALK36
==============================================================================

Go to Porth Llaffan and talk to Jona, the summoner girl in her house. Accept
her request. Rest at the inn, and exit it at night. There's a ghost of a woman
on the beach, talk to her and tell her "No" when prompted. After that, talk to
Jona again. You'll have to get three pieces of equipment.
1. Silver Shield. Buy it in a new armor shop in Stornway or create through
Alchemy (that would actually be a lot less cheaper).
2. Buy a Flowing Dress in Wormwood Creek.
3. Buy a Watermaul Wand in Gleeba.
Equip them all on one characters (on Priest, for example) and go to the Tywll
Cave. Make your way to the Cuddiedig Cliff and talk to Jona there. You'll have
to fight the real Lleviathan now. He's not much harder than the previous one,
so if you've defeated Corvus, this should be a "no-problem" to you. After 
defeating him, you'll obtain a [FYGG]. Eat it. After the scene, you'll obtain
[STERLING'S WHISTLE]. You are now able to summon the Starflight Express from
the world map. Isn't that awesome? When flying on the Express, simple press A
on some continent to land there. Choose "No", and you'll be taken to the Realm
of the Almighty. You can talk to Celestria in the palace, and she'll be glad
to recreate the Realm of the Mighty for you, so you can go there and finish
any infinished business you have there.
Now that you have the Express in your possession, there are some places on the
world map we couldn't get to before. Well, now we can. Here goes:
1. The northeast island, [RUINOUS SHIELD] in the cave. There's also a VERY
important quest here in the cave, that nets you a Legacy Boss treasure map as
a reward!
2. Lonely Coast Cave, two chests with [MINI MEDAL] and [ORICHALCUM]. There's
also a little item shop here:

THE HEXAGON
-----------

.------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Hexagoon                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 175 Exp. Points, 100 Gold Coins  |
| Drops: Magic Beast Hide                  |
'------------------------------------------'

This boss is not really that dangerous, even though your fighting him alone.
All he can do is ram you or throw some rocks at you that deal 7 or 8 HP dmg
depending on your current level. At level 7/8 he's a pushover, cause he only
has about 100 HP. Just don't forget to use Heal spell/Medicinal Herbs when
necessary.



LOCH STORN
----------

.------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Wight Knight                      |
|------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 800 Exp. Points, 200 Gold Coins  |
| Drops: Iron Gauntlets                    |
'------------------------------------------'

If you have a full party or at least three members, this battle should be very
easy. All that Wight Knight can do is either a regular attack or a Bolt Cutter
attack, which is not very different from his regular attack. He can also heal
himself for about 35 HP, but that happens rarely. Attacking one after another
and multiplying the damage output is the key to quick victory here.



BRIGADOOM
---------

.------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Morag                             |
|------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 1600 Exp. Points, 350 Gold Coins |
| Drops: High Heels                        |
'------------------------------------------'

Morag is certainly not a difficult boss. Her regular attacks are weak, and if
you have a full party, you'll be doing like 10 more times damage than her per
round. She also has an HP Hoover attack that restores her HP a little, and a
Crack ice spell. Make sure to heal yourself if she ever uses it. She can also
become enraged and focus her attacks on one character. The last thing to note
is that Morag can do a weak hit-all attack that can paralyze your characters.
Use Moonwort Bulbs if needed. All in all, at level 12 or so, she's a pushover.



QUARANTOMB
----------

.------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Ragin' Contagion                  |
|------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 2295 Exp. Points, 600 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Royal Soil                        |
'------------------------------------------'

This boss is a little bit different from the previous ones, as it acts twice
per turn. Still, if you're properly leveled, it's nothing to worry about. His
regular attack does between 10 to 25 damage, depending on the character. It
also may cause poison status. Counter it with Antidotal Herbs/Squelch spell.
He has two stat-decreasing spells - Deceratle (decreases agility) and Kasap
(decreases defense). You shouldn't have any buffing spells by now, unless you
are very overleveled, so I suggest just suck it up and fight the Contagion
that way. He doesn't have that much HP, after all.



TOWER OF TRADES

.------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Master of Nu'un                   |
|------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 2904 Exp. Points, 780 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Lava Lump                         |
'------------------------------------------'

If you're around level 15-16 like me, get prepared for a pretty tough battle.
Not only this guy acts twice per turn, he has some nasty buffing skills such
as Buff (ups his defense). Usually he uses Buff once per two turns, raising
his defense so much that your weapons will be doing 10-20 damage only. He also
frequently drains magic of your characters. Although his most dangerous attack
is Woosh. It's a hit-all wind element spell that hits your characters for 35
or 40 HP if Master of Nu'un goes "haywire". Ouch. Sometimes he uses lightning
attacks, although they're a little less intimidating. Make sure you have lots
of healing items on your hands. Spells like Heal/Midheal are a must. If you
have a Priest, he might trigger his Coup de Grace move which'll be very useful
to your party if it's very low on HP. Anyway, use elemental spells like Crack,
Frizz, etc. Hopefully they'll hit the boss for 35 dmg at least. Multiplying
your damage is also useful here, especially if the boss acts before you.



TYWLL CAVE

.------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Lleviathan                        |
|------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 4134 Exp. Points, 960 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Emerald Moss                      |
'------------------------------------------'

Surprisingly, this boss is much easier than the previous one. He attacks once
per turn (and here I thought all bosses starting from Nu'un will act twice),
and his moves are not that threatening. He has a regular physical attack and
a swipe attack that hits all party members. He can become enraged and focus
his attacks on a certain character. Other than that, he has high HP, so the
battle will take longer than expected. Try to Egg On a Warrior (if you have
him/her) with a your Hero a couple of times and deal some serious damage.



ZERE ROCKS

.-------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Garth Goyle                        |
|-------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 4134 Exp. Points, 1250 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Terrible Tattoo                    |
'-------------------------------------------'

Well, this boss battle isn't too hard, but it's very long and tedious, because
of Goyle's constant buffing. Basically, he starts a battle by casting Magic
Barrier (ups his resistance to magic) and Kabuff (ups his defense). He acts
twice per turn, and can do the same moves for two turns straight. His attack
are not really intimidating - he stomps a character (or the whole party) for
about 20-30 dmg or 45 dmg if he used Psyche Up beforehand. The main difficulty
here is dealing damage to him, because with double Kabuff, he's pretty much
invisible for a couple of turns. My advice would be to Egg On a Warrior with
your Hero to 100 tension and attack Garth Goyle when his Kabuff goes away.
Three or four of these attacks, and Goyle is no more. Also, the Terrible
Tattoo this guy drops is cursed and if you equip it, the only way you'll be
able to get rid of it is to go to a church and perform a benediction ritual.



THE BAD CAVE
------------

.-------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Tyrantula                          |
|-------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 5231 Exp. Points, 1500 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Tangleweb                          |
'-------------------------------------------'

This boss is definitely easier to kill than Garth Goyle, but it also has some
nasty moves. The Venomissile attack hits all party members and may poison your
characters. The sticky web attack makes them unable to move for a turn or two.
Eerie Light makes them more succeptible to status ailments (i.e. poison), and
Wind Sickles is just a hit-all attack that does about 20-24 dmg. There is
really no strategy - just hit it till it dies and don't forget to heal your HP
and poisoning. Fly Swat may deal some extra damage, coupled with Egg On.



THE PLUMBED DEPTHS

.-------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Grand Lizzier                      |
|-------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 6200 Exp. Points, 1750 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Dragon Scale                       |
'-------------------------------------------'

Another not-so-hard boss, which basically only uses Fire Breath all the time
that does around 20 dmg to the whole party. He acts once per turn. He also
occasionally does Intimidating Scream, but it fails most of the time. Other
than that, the one thing that may be pretty dangerous is when he starts doing
regular attacks that deal around 60-80 dmg to single character. Be on your
guard and heal accordingly, and you'll be fine. Use Dragon Slash for quicker
victory.



BATSUREG

.-------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Larstasnaras                       |
|-------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 8200 Exp. Points, 2000 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Enchanted Stone                    |
'-------------------------------------------'

This boss is another hard-to-kill because of his constant usage of the Dazzle
spell. It makes your characters hallucinate and miss their attacks. Casting
offensive spells is also not really useful here, because of her Magic Barrier.
Her regular attack deal around 40 dmg and drain your HP. She can rarely use a
knockdown attack. The most damaging spell would be Boom that deals 35-50 dmg
to the whole party. This battle is not really hard, just tedious, so remember
to heal when needed and use chained attacks to take the beast down.



THE OLD SCHOOL
--------------

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Dreadmaster                         |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 10000 Exp. Points, 2550 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Sage's Elixir                       |
'--------------------------------------------'

The Dreadmaster uses physical attacks or Crackle (hit-all ice spell), for
about 40 dmg. He occasionally uses Double Trouble too, which is pretty much
like his ohysical attack. Zammle does about 45 dmg to one character. He may
Psyche Up himself (sometimes even twice in a row) and deal about 100 dmg to a
single character. Similar to the previous boss battle, this one is boring too.
It's pretty much the "attack-attack-heal when low on HP" kind of thing. Yawn.



THE BOWHOLE
-----------

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Gadrongo                            |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 12500 Exp. Points, 3050 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Ethereal Stone                      |
'--------------------------------------------'

Gadrongo might not seem like a particularly hard boss, but in fact, he is. He
starts off the battle with weak physical attacks, and then moves on to Ground
Pound which deals about 50 dmg to the whole party or attacks a single party
member for about 200 dmg. If you're unlucky, he may do this twice or thrice in
a row. The good news is that he acts only once per turn. He also has the
Burning Breath attack, but uses it rarely. Try to kill him as fast as you can,
leaving only one party member to heal everyone. If things go bad, other guys
should help out with healing items. Critical hits should do the job faster,
as well as beast-damaging abilities.



THE MAGMAROO
------------

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Greygnarl                           |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 15500 Exp. Points                  |
| Drops: Dragon Scale                        |
'--------------------------------------------'

Greygnarl is pretty easy if you have at least two characters with Dragon Slash
and heal properly. His regular attack is weak, and besides that, he can launch
a fire-based attack on the whole party for about 35 dmg and the Blinding Light
attack that hits all party members for about 65-70 dmg. If you heal when you
need and keep attacking, Greygnarl will fall in no time.



GORTRESS
--------

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Goreham-Hogg                        |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 17500 Exp. Points, 3550 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Tough Guy Tattoo                    |
'--------------------------------------------'

This boss uses nothing but physical attacks, so proper defense value will save
you a lot of trouble. Keep the Dragon Warrior armor on your hero, and upgrade
the equipment of your other characters, so that their defense would be at
least 180-190. Hogg uses two types of Chain Swing: one vertical (hits a single
character for about 60 dmg, high possibility of a critical for about 170 dmg),
and one horizontal (hits the whole party for about 70 dmg). He can also Psyche
Up himself to raise the attack, but that happens not too often. Since his HP
is pretty low, this shouldn't be a tough battle if you keep your characters'
HP in proper condition and use abilities like Falcon Slash/Miracle Slash.



GITTINGHAM PALACE
-----------------

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Hootingham-Gore, 2x Bad Karmour     |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 18500 Exp. Points, 4050 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Sage's Elixir                       |
'--------------------------------------------'

Obviously, you should take out the Karmours first. They're annoying, and can
sometimes protect Gore from your attacks. When the boss is left alone, he is
pathetically easy, as all he can do are Fuddle/Eerie Glow spells that almost
never work and weak Swoosh/Frizzle elemental spells. Don't use magic on him,
as his resistance is high and he frequently casts Bounce on himself. Physical
attack do the job fine. Don't get cocky, though, as the next bosses will be
much harder.

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Goresby-Purrvis                     |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 20000 Exp. Points, 4550 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Fizzle Foil                         |
'--------------------------------------------'

This Lieutenant is far more difficult than the previous one. Similarly to Hogg
this guy uses only physical sword attacks. His Multislash deals around 60 dmg
to the whole party, but hits random characters. The Upward Slice is the most
dangerous attack - it can knock a character down and has a high chance to do
a critical hit, and that's about 220 dmg to a single character. He also has
moves like Flame Slash and Kacrackle Slash but uses them rarely. If you have
a party with good armors, you shouldn't worry too much about Multislash or
other attacks, as your Priest/Sage should use Multiheal every second turn.
Things can get ugly if Purrvis starts to take your characters out with crits
every turn. Make good use of Zing (or Kazing, if you have it) here. If you're
lucky enough, you can score a few criticals on him, too. Simply keep attacking
him with your most powerful abilities, and he'll go down sooner or later.
High resilience value also plays an important role in this fight, and thief
or paladin vocations have plenty of it.

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - King Godwyn                         |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: Nothing                            |
| Drops: Nothing                             |
'--------------------------------------------'

Godwyn's first form is laughably easy. All he uses is the Kafrizz spell, and
a ball fling attack. Just remember to heal when needed and you'll do fine.

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - King Godwyn                         |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 26500 Exp. Points, 6000 Gold Coins |
| Drops: Sceptre of Gitt                     |
'--------------------------------------------'

Okay, the second round of this battle is much harder. First of all, don't you
bother with those Oomph, Buff and Accelerate spells as Godwyn uses Disruptive
Wave to erase them. He relies only on fire magic, Kafrizz and the Inferno 
spell that does around 65 dmg to the whole party. This would've been easy, but
he attacks twice per turn making it very hard to heal inbetween the attacks
and deal some damage to himself, too. His regular attack is fairly damaging
too, so your main priority in this fight should be not losing party members,
because if you Zing-ing them back to life, Godwyn might finish you off easily.
After you've depleted his HP by a half, he starts using Magic Barrier and
Kabuff. Don't bother with spells, Sap him a couple of times instead. Use only
the mightiest attacks and throw in some Sage's Elixirs to replenish your MP,
because it tends to run out very quickly in this battle.



REALM OF THE MIGHTY
-------------------

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Corvus                              |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 28500 Exp. Points                  |
| Drops: Nothing                             |
'--------------------------------------------'

The first battle against Corvus is not as difficult as I expected it to be,
honestly. Obviously, he attacks twice per turn, but the majority of his spells
and attacks just can't... deal enough damage to have you worried. First of
all, he uses Psyche Up frequently, and sometimes, even twice in a row. THAT'S
where you have to be on your guard. Defend with inferior characters if you
want to avoid unnecessary risk. His regular attack does about 40 dmg to one
character. The lightning attack does about the same amount of damage to all
characters (much more if he used Psyche Up beforehand). Sometimes he flies up
in the sky and does a sky drop for about 100 dmg to a single character. And
finally, he can use Kaswoosh that hits all party members for 100-150 dmg,
depending on his level of tension. Oh, sometimes, if you're lucky, Corvus will
waste one of his moves on laughter. Basically, this fight is not too hard, you
just have to predict his tension attacks and defend. Multiheal should be your
best friend. As always, use Slash abilities to the fullest, and try not to
get ahead of yourself - better safe than sorry. Psyching Up/Egging On helps a
lot in this fight. Corvus doesn't have that much of HP, but it's probably
because it's not the REAL end yet...

.--------------------------------------------.
| BOSS - Barbarus                            |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 32500 Exp. Points                  |
| Drops: Yggdrasil Leaf                      |
'--------------------------------------------'

For a pre-final boss, Barbarus isn't all that hard. His attacks are pretty
weak. His regular attack does about 45 dmg to a single character, and his Claw
Slash does about 80 dmg. Cloud of Malevolent Darkness hits all party members
for about 50 dmg. He also uses the Kazam spell for about 60 dmg to a single
ally, and Wave of Panic which has a pretty low chance of decreasing your
characters' defense and agility. Barbarus has low HP, so killing him won't
take too long, if you're well leveled (about 41-43) and use Multiheal or other
healing spells/items when needed. There's really no strategy cause Barbarus is
really really easy, just a warm up before the final boss. If you're having
trouble with him, consider doing some serious leveling.

.--------------------------------------------.
| FINAL BOSS - Corvus                        |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Reward: 40000 Exp. Points                  |
| Drops: Nothing                             |
'--------------------------------------------'

Corvus is the final boss of the game's main story. Well, he certainly is a tad
harder than he was before. Most likely, his difficulty would depend on your
levels, vocations and equipment, but I just want to say that all my characters
were at level 45 during this battle, and my weapons were basically Miracle
Swords with some other weapon equipped on my Priest. You may want to use a 
Paladin or an Armamentalist in this battle, as thy would be helpful, and of 
course you HAVE to have soemone with Multiheal or even better, Omniheal. The
boss has a few spells and abilities from the last battle - like Kafrizz that
does about 100 dmg to one character and Sky Drop. Protection from breath-based
attack should come in handy here, as Corvus has Chilly Breath that hits the
whole party for about 70 dmg and Burning Breath that may paralyze your allies.
You can use skills like Kabuff or Oomph at the start of battle, but later
Corvus will start doing Disruptive Wave to erase th effects of these spells.
His other attack include Combo Attack that hits random characters for random
damage, and a Bolt attack that hits the whole party for about 75 dmg. He also
uses Eye Gleam rarely to put a single party member to sleep. Now, in the end
of the battle he can also use Meditate to restore 500 HP to himself and Pray
to restore his MP completely. He also frequently starts using Psyche Up to
boost his damage. Now, the most intimidating spell he has is Magic Burst, that
hits your whole party for about 175 dmg, and even more if you're unlucky and
Corvus Psyched Up beforehand. That's where Multiheal comes in handy. You 
should never let him kill any of your characters, because then it's just gonna
get much harder. Moves like Falcon Slash or Warrior's Attack Attacker should
be of great help to you. After you feel you've depleted Corvus' HP by half at
least, you try to use Magic Barrier to survive Magic Burst if he pulls it off.

Mini Medals are those little shiny gold medals you find in red and blue chests
and even in cupboards, barrels and jars, if you're lucky. The chests in grotto
dungeons also have lots of them. Lastly, you can get them through DQVC. Now,
you can't sell mini medals, so what do you need them for? When you arrive in 
Dourbridge, go to the northeast tent on the east side of the town. There's a
pirate inside, called Cap'n Max Meddlin'. He will give you important items in
exchange for the mini medals you have collected so far. This is the chart:

XI..................................ALCHEMY.............................DQIX11
==============================================================================

Dragon Quest IX offers you one more interesting feature - alchemy. With the
help of alchemy, you can create hundreds of new items and equipment pieces,
needed for quests, optional dungeons and of course, making you stronger.
The alchemy pot is available to you once you defeat the Wight Knight and talk
to King Storn. After that, you can use it in Erinn's inn in Stornway. You need
to find recipes in order to perform alchemy, or use the "Try Your Luck" option
to mix random ingredients to create something completely new (if you don't
have the recipe for a certain item). Note that alchemy recipes can be found in
bookshelves or obtained by the means of progressing the story/taking certain
quests. Here is the list of ALL the recipes in the game. I'll divide into 
three categories: weapons, armor and items. Weapons, in their turn, are 
subdivided into Swords, Spears, Knives, Wands, Whips, Staves, Claws, Fans,
Axes, Hammers, Boomerangs, Bows. Armor is subdivided into Shield, Head, Torso,
Arms, Legs, Feet and Accessories.

==============================================================================
XIV........................FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS...................DQIX14
==============================================================================

1. - When was this game released in Japan?
   - July 11, 2009.

2. - I've heard they've decided to go with action-based battle system first,
     why did they change their mind?
   - I'm glad that they changed their mind, because that would destroy the
     series. Probably they thought about it and decided to make other DQ games
     like this - the Joker ones, for example. The main series should remain
     turn-based.

3. - Is this game worth getting, if I'm a RPG enthusiast?
   - If you're an RPG fan in general, and like the old fashioned turn-based
     style RPGs, you should love this game. By all means get it, it's one of
     the coolest RPGs on the DS.

4. - I liked this game, anything else like this on DS?
   - If you've played DQ VIII on PS2 already, then go with DQ IV and DQ V on
     the DS. DQ V is amazing, and one of the most prominent games in the
     series. Also, you can try Final Fantasy III and IV. The upcoming Golden
     Sun: Dark Dawn should be good, too.

5. - Who is the developer of this game?
   - Level 5.

6. - How long is this game?
   - The main story is about 35-40 hours, the post-game content is very large.
     Might take you forever to finish everything.

7. - How many quests does this game have?
   - As of now, 120. But there will be some new ones (about 60) added via Wi-
     Fi. Make sure to download them onto your DS.

8. - What's the best vocation?
   - Hard to say. Everyone has their own preferences, but I like Paladins and
     Sages the most.

9. - When can I create my party?
   - Before the encounter with the Wight Knight talk to King Storn, go to the
     inn in Stornway and talk to Patty.

10. - When can I change my vocations?
    - Talk to Jack in Alltrades Abbey after you beat the boss at the Tower of
      Trades.

11. - What's the deal with the blue chests?
    - These chests respawn their contents every once in a while. They contain
      random items all the time. They can be opened by anyone in your party.

12. - Any missables in this game?
    - The only one I can think of is the chests in the Observatory, L2. Once
      you get the Ultimate Key, you'll be brought to Observatory as a part of
      the plot. Open the cell door with the key and grab those chests, cause
      you won't be able to get them in the post-game.

13. - Any quick way to gain levels?
    - Sure. There are Metal Slimes in the Quarantomb, Metal Medleys in the
      Bad Cave, and Liquid Metal Slimes in the Bowhole. There are also Metal
      King Slimes and Platinum King Jewels in the treasure map dungeons called
      grottos. And there's this Slime Hill place north of Angel Falls, but it
      is accessible only on Starflight Express.

14. - Any quick way to gain money?
    - Gold Golems in the Djust Desert.

15. - Why does this game have some many puns (town names, enemy/boss names,
      etc.)?
    - Because it's Dragon Quest. No, seriously, DQ localizations have been
      famous for quirky enemy and boss names. I mean, it doesn't distract me
      from the game, so I'm fine with it.

16. - How do I quickly move around towns?
    - Chimaera Wing item or Zoom spell.

17. - Are there any overworld treasure chests?
    - No.

18. - Does DQIX have a casino?
    - No.

19. - Where can I find my first Treasure Map?
    - It's a reward for completing Quest 015 (in the Heights of Loneliness).
      King Storn also gives you one. Quest 062 gives a Legacy Boss treasure
      map as a reward.

20. - How do I get Starflight Express after I beat the game?
    - Go to Porth Llaffan and talk to Jona in her house to start Quest 039.


21. - Is there any story at all after beating the game?
    - Yep. Although most of it is DLC stuff.
