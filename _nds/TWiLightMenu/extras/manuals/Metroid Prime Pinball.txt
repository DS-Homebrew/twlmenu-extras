==============================
== 1. GUIDE OVERVIEW/CONTROLS:
==============================
Metroid Prime Pinball is, as you
would imagine, quite different
from your typ- ical Metroid
game. It's an interesting twist
on the original Metroid Prime,
for sure, with all of the areas
intact (except Magmoor Caverns,
which is the default Multiplayer
Table, and Chozo Ruins, which is
surprisingly absent from the
game - a shame, as fighting
Flaaghra could've been
interesting) in surpris- ingly
nice fashion. Read below for
some more in-depth explanations
on the specifics of the game.

  ===================
  ++ 1.1 - MAIN MENU:
  ===================
  From the start menu, you have
  four options available to you:
  - Multi Mission
  - Single Mission
  - Wireless Play
  - Options

  MULTI MISSION is where the
  bulk of the gameplay takes
  place. You begin on one of two
  default tables - either the
  Pirate Frigate or Tallon
  Overworld, and work through
  the other areas (except
  Magmoor) to reach the Impact
  Crater, where you'll have to
  square off against Metroid
  Prime's two forms. This mode
  is all single-round, meaning
  you must play through all the
  tables without any means of
  "saving" until you have
  defeated the final boss. In
  this way, it makes it more
  like a real pinball game.
  Remember, real life has no
  contin- ues or extra lives.
  Well, you do have extra balls,
  but that's beside the point.
  After passing certain
  objectives in this mode, you
  unlock extras in the Single
  Mission mode, below.

  SINGLE MISSION is geared more
  towards just amassing a high
  score on a single table. Like
  Multi Mission, you'll begin
  with the two default tables.
  By defeating Thardus and Omega
  Pirate in Multi Mission,
  you'll add the Phendrana
  Drifts and Phazon Mines tables
  to this mode, respectively. By
  collecting 12 Artifacts in
  Multi Mission and successfully
  opening the Artifact Temple,
  you can add that table to this
  mode, and finally, defeat
  Metroid Prime to earn the
  Impact Crater table here.
  There is no real advancement
  in this mode, as the only goal
  is to stay alive as long as
  possible and rack up points.

  WIRELESS PLAY uses the built-
  in wireless adapter to send a
  signal out to any other
  Nintendo DS' within a
  specified range. You can
  compete with up to 8 other
  people off of a single MPP DS
  Card, and engage them in a
  frantic Multi- ball showdown
  that takes place in a
  surprisingly drab rendition of
  Magmoor Caverns. At least the
  menu music for Wireless Mode
  is spiffy (it's a remix of the
  Lower Norfair theme from Super
  Metroid - with the heavier
  percussion, it sounds more
  like the SM rendition than the
  MP1 remix). Alternatively, you
  can get some practice on this
  table by playing against
  yourself. The practice
  session, like the real
  multiplayer mode, ends when
  you reach 100,000 points.

  OPTIONS, obviously, is the
  default options for the game.
  However, there isn't a lot to
  choose from - you can trigger
  the DS' backlight on/off (why
  you would want to is beyond
  me), switch the Rumble Pak
  feature on or off (you can
  negate this entirely by just
  not inserting the included
  Rumble Pak into the GBA slot).

  A fifth mode, EXPERT MISSION,
  becomes available once you
  have completed the normal
  Multi-Mission mode at least
  once. Here the difficulty is
  significantly ramped up, you
  earn less points per
  objective, and enemies appear
  with much more frequency.

  ==========================
  ++ 1.2 - DEFAULT CONTROLS:
  ==========================
  To the best of my knowledge,
  the control scheme for the
  game cannot be altered. It's
  not like the controls are that
  difficult to use anyway.

  R BUTTON/RIGHT D-PAD BUTTON -
  Right Flipper L BUTTON/LEFT
  D-PAD BUTTON - Left Flipper

  POWER - Duh? Turns NDS off
  SELECT - No Function
  START - Pauses the Game

  X BUTTON - Missiles (in Combat
  Mode) - must acquire Missile
  first. A BUTTON - Right
  Flipper Y BUTTON - Power Bomb
  (in Morph Ball Mode) - must
  acquire PB first. B BUTTON -
  Bombs (in Morph Ball Mode)

  Unlike most DS games, this one
  makes almost no use of the
  touch screen func- ionality of
  the DS. However, you can "rock
  the table" by sliding either a
  finger (easier) or the stylus
  across the touch screen. This
  can greatly aid in helping
  keep your ball on the table
  when sometimes it seems like
  you're on a beeline straight
  for the gutter. Just nudge the
  table back and forth to do
  some short trajectory
  correction, and you'll be
  fine.

--------------------------------
--------------------------------

====================
== 2. GAME OVERVIEW:
====================


  =====================
  ++ 2.1 - TABLE TYPES:
  =====================
  There are two main types of
  tables in the game - Adventure
  Tables and Arena Tables.
  Adventure Tables are mostly
  just filled with chances to
  score mini- games and earn
  points, while Arena Tables
  feature less of that and more
  chances for enemies to appear
  so that they can harass you
  while a boss is busy rumbling
  around the area. The tables
  are classified below:

    ADVENTURE TABLES
    ================
    Pirate Frigate - styled
    after the Frigate Orpheon
    Tallon Overworld - lush
    jungle area, with some
    mechanical parts Magmoor
    Caverns - lava cave (not
    really) environment

    ARENA TABLES
    ============
    Phendrana Drifts - resembles
    Quarantine Cave Phazon Mines
    - styled mostly after the
    Omega Quarters Artifact
    Temple - 2D representation
    of the Temple Impact Crater
    - self explanatory; sort of
    like the SubChambers

  See below, Section 3, for more
  in-depth information regarding
  the layouts of each table,
  specific minigames that appear
  in each, and other important
  information.

  ========================
  ++ 2.2 - SCORING SYSTEM:
  ========================
  Scoring is like any real or VG
  pinball game - you earn more
  points by running over various
  sections of the table, hitting
  bumpers in scoring regions, or
  triggering jackpots. As this
  is styled after Metroid, you
  also earn points by defeating
  enemies the game throws your
  way. The Jackpot is a
  continuously increasing
  scoring counter that you can
  get if you shoot the ball the
  correct way. Many items,
  though, are not scored or
  added to your point total
  until you lose a ball down the
  gutter. This is where the
  Bounty Bonus comes into play.

  The Bounty Bonus is based on
  the following criteria:
  - Total number of each enemy
    killed
  - Total number of Specials
    collected (20-50,000 per
    Special)
  - How many times you hit the
    Bounty Multiplier

  The good thing about this is
  that your score is counted for
  the entire game, not just the
  ball you were playing on, so
  your scores accumulate and
  become worth more the more you
  play. Skillful manipulation of
  the Wall Jump and the Reward
  Scanner is key so you can gain
  as many Extra Balls as
  possible to help in earning
  higher and higher scores.

  The game saves your high
  scores automatically after
  each game. If you place on the
  high scores list, you'll be
  asked to input your initials
  or other three-letter moniker
  of your choice. The number of
  Artifacts you collected is
  displayed next to your point
  total, and if you've completed
  the game, a num- ber will
  appear over the Artifact
  symbol to denote how many
  times you managed to complete
  the game.


  ========================
  ++ 2.3 - BOARD FEATURES:
  ========================
  Every table is, of course,
  unique, but there are a number
  of features that most of the
  tables share in common. These
  include:

  1) THE MODE SAUCER: This
     usually is a hologram
     somewhere on the board that
 either depicts an enemy or an
 arrow. If an enemy, hitting it
 with the ball triggers the
 minigame mode for whichever
 enemy is highlighted (for exam-
 ple, hitting it while a Metroid
 is displayed triggers either
 Metroid Mania or Metroid Blast,
 depending on the status of the
 SAMUS indicator lights). When
 this hologram displays an
 arrow, rocket yourself into it
 to gain the ability to warp
 between tables - a crucial
 power in Multi Mission.

  2) S-A-M-U-S INDICATOR LIGHTS:
     While playing, knock your
     ball over the flash-
 ing blue ramps to trigger
 another letter to light up.
 Whenever all five letters are
 lit, roll over the Combat
 Saucer just above the gutter to
 trigger a Blast session, where
 you get to pop out of Morph
 Ball mode and take a crack at
 some enemies with your good old
 arm cannon.

  3) COMBAT SAUCER: As explained
     above, this activates once
     the SAMUS lights
 have been lit. When active, you
 have to defeat all the enemies
 that swarm the table. You can
 only be hit four times before
 reverting back to Morph Ball
 mode. Successfully complete
 this mode and (in most cases),
 you'll
receive an Artifact as a reward.

  4) BOUNTY ROLLOVERS: These are
     located normally near the
     top of any given
 table, and consist of a few
 rollovers along bith a series
 of bumpers. Hit these to
 increase the potential Jackpot
 score, which can add a massive
amount of points to your score.

  5) KICKBACKS: These little
     springs lie in the outer
     lanes and prevent your
 ball from being shot down into
 the gutter when they fall into
 these lanes. They activate at
 the start, but disappear when
 used once, and can be re-
 energized by using the Reward
 Scanner.

  6) FORCE FIELD: This helpful
     feature keeps you from
     losing the ball between
 the two lowest flippers. It
 disappears after a while, and
 can be reacti-
vated using the Reward Scanner.

  7) REWARD SCANNER: This cute
     little device looks like a
     Spinner from Metroid
 Prime 1 and 2. While rolling
 around, enter one to start a
 roulette with multiple random
 prizes, including: Health
 Recharge (obvious), Big Points
 (adds anywhere between 30,000
 and 50,000 points to your
 score), Phazon Multiball (MB
 mode with Phazon-powered
 balls), Combat Ready (activates
 the Combat Saucer), Extra Ball
 (extra life, basically), Force
 Field (engages the Force Field
 at the bottom near the gutter),
 Missile Recharge (refills your
 Missile stock), Power Bomb
 (gives you a Power Bomb to
 use), Bounty Multiplier
 (increases the Bounty
 Multiplier score for higher
 point ratio), and Kickback
 Ready (activates the outer-lane
 kickbacks).

  8) WALL JUMP: This is usually
     stashed away as a red light
     in one of the upper
 corners. Hit it once to
 activate the mechanism, then
 again to enter the Wall Jump
 mode, where you have to hit L
 and R as you carom off the
 walls trying to reach the
 Artifact/Special that lies at
 the top.

  9) BUMPERS & RAMPS: Bumpers
     are locates near the Bounty
     Multiplier and can
 really add to the overall
 Jackpot score. Hitting them
 more often can also serve to
 advance the hologram displayed
 in the Mode Saucer. Ramps are
 located all around the table
 and serve as point-gaining
 mechanisms. Shoot a ball up a
 ramp when a white arrow is
 flashing to start a combo.
 Other arrows and circles that
 may appear include: Blue Circle
 (turns on one of the SAMUS
 indicators), Green Circle
 (opens a multi-ball lock), Red
 Circle (readies the Wall Jump),
 Green Arrow (locks ball/starts
 multiball), Purple Arrow
 (readies the Kickbacks), Red
 Arrow (starts the Wall Jump
 minigame), Red & Blue Arrows
 (activates Phazon Multiball -
 Tallon Overworld only).

  ==============================
  ++ 2.4 - COLLECTING ARTIFACTS:
  ==============================
  Just like playing the original
  Metroid Prime, you need to
  collect twelve of the
  Artifacts in order to progress
  to the final levels. Unlike
  the original, however, the
  Artifacts are not in set
  locations - you earn them by
  completing in-game challenges
  such as mini-games and
  whatnot. Completing mini-game
  ob- jectives, such as Burrower
  Bash, Triclops Terror, etc,
  usually net you an Artifact.
  Reaching the Wall Jump area
  and successfully navigating
  the Wall Jump also gains you
  one on the first try (in
  Multi-Mission, subsequent Wall
  Jumps earn you Extra Balls; in
  Single Player, you earn
  Specials worth 50,000 points).
  Defeating a boss also reveals
  an Artifact. Once you gain
  twelve, trigger a Destination
  Warp and you'll be able to
  reach the Artifact Temple
  table.

  =================
  ++ 2.5 - ENEMIES:
  =================
  There are many enemies that
  will appear during the course
  of the game. Most appear
  during minigames, but
  occasionally they'll just
  appear for the sake of
  cameo'ing or ramping up the
  difficulty, the latter if
  you're just cruising through
  the game. Below is a list of
  those that will make their
  appearances.

  1) BEETLE
 ------
 Description: These tunneling
 creatures attack by charging at
 their prey.
  Appears in: Tallon Overworld

  2) BURROWER
 --------
 Description: Tunneling
 creatures that attack their
 prey.
  Appears in: Tallon Overworld

  3) METROID
 -------
 Description: Vicious, life-
 sucking parasites from which
 there is little
    escape. Set bombs to get
    them off if you get
    snatched.
 Appears in: P. Frigate, Tallon
 Overworld, Magmoor Caverns,
 Impact Crater

  4) PARASITE
 --------
 Description: A strain of
 parasitic creature, deadly in
 large numbers. Appears in:
 Pirate Frigate

  5) PUFFER
 ------
 Description: Floating orbs that
 leave behind poison gas when
 destroyed. Appears in: Pirate
 Frigate

  6) SHRIEKBAT
 ---------
 Description: These fast-moving
 creatures dive-bomb their
 targets while
    emitting a high-pitched
    shriek (hence, the name).
 Appears in: Pirate Frigate

  7) SPACE PIRATE
 ------------
 Description: Starfaring brigand
 of thieves that have a long
 history of
   conflict with Samus Aran.
 Found in: Pirate Frigate,
 Phazon Mines

  8) TRICLOPS
 --------
 Description: Creatures with
 powerful jaws that will (very
 cheaply, too)
    grab and dump you down the
    gutter. Set bombs to break
    free.
 Appears in: Tallon Overworld,
 Phendrana Drifts

  9) WAR WASP
 --------
 Description: Beelike creatures
 that attack you in swarms of
 two or three.
  Appears in: Tallon Overworld


  ======================
  ++ 2.6 - BOSS BATTLES:
  ======================
  Boss battles only occur on
  Arena Tables, and usually take
  a few seconds be- fore they
  actually begin. Generally, the
  objective is simply to rocket
  into the boss as much as
  possible while dodging
  attacks, other enemies, and
  table hazards to defeat the
  offending creature. Below is a
  list of the bosses and some
  hints for defeating them.

  THARDUS (boss of Phendrana
  Drifts)
  ------------------------------
  Thardus behaves much like his
  MP1 counterpart, except for
  the blizzard/storm bits and
  turning near invisible. He
  either summons rocks to chuck
  at you, or he rolls around.
  Grab the Power Bomb near him,
  and detonate it with the Y
  Button when he's standing
  still to take out a chunk of
  his life. The primary
  distraction in the area when
  dealing with Thardus are the
  Triclops he can summon.

  OMEGA PIRATE (boss of Phazon
  Mines)
  ------------------------------
  Omega Pirate retains all of
  his moves from MP1, except for
  the Chameleon Manta (thank
  God). He'll create shockwaves
  that are near impossible to
  avoid, and he'll summon Space
  Pirates to get in your way.
  The Phazon Mines board
  features a Missile upgrade, so
  it's in your best interest to
  trigger the SAMUS indicators
  during this fight so you can
  fire away at OP.

  META RIDLEY (boss of Artifact
  Temple)
  ------------------------------
  Meta Ridley isn't so much of a
  real boss fight as it is just
  dodging his bombing runs. Your
  goal is to hit the twelve
  Artifact posts before he can
  reset them. Do so
  successfully, and you reach
  the Impact Crater, and Meta
  Ridley is no more.

  METROID PRIME (boss of Impact
  Crater)

=============================
== 4. WIRELESS DOWNLOAD PLAY:
=============================
The wireless play option uses a
single DS Card of Metroid Prime
Pinball to send the game out to
other players (up to a maximum
of eight).

  ==============================
  ++ 4.1 - SETUP/DOWNLOAD
     INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==============================
  The instructions, whether
  you're the host or client, are
  very simple to follow:

  HOST DS
  -------
  - Start MPP game
  - Select "Wireless Mission"
    from menu
  - Wait while MPP is downloaded
    to friends' DS'. Their names
    will appear in
    the roster. When finished, a
    ball next to their name will
    cease flashing.
  - Press START button to begin
    play.

  CLIENT DS
  ---------
  - Remove any DS Card from your
    DS
  - Select DS Download Play from
    your DS menu
  - Select MPP from the
    available downloads menu
  - Select "Yes" to download the
    software*
  - Wait until the Host DS
    starts play, then join in

  * Do note that the download is
    temporary cache only. It
    will be deleted
    as soon as your DS is turned
    off.

  ==============================
  ++ 4.2 - PLAYING A MULTIPLAYER
     GAME:
  ==============================
  Playing a Wireless Multiplayer
  game is different than the
  regular modes. The first
  player to reach 100,000 points
  wins, regardless. The basic
  goal is to shoot the Ramps,
  Targets, Rollovers, Spinners,
  and Saucers to earn as many
  points as you can in as fast a
  time as possible. There are a
  few things that are unique to
  the Magmoor Caverns board that
  others don't have:

  1) PROGRESS METER - a meter
     tracks yours and other
     players' progress towards
 the goal. Your position is
 orange; other players are blue.
  2) RANKING - a small number
     (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc...)
