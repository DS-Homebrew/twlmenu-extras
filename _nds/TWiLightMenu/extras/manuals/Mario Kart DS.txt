Menu and Game Modes
-------------------

From the Main Menu, you are
shown a series of options. This
section will inform you of what
each part contains and a quick
explanation of that mode.

----------
Grand Prix
----------

Located in the Single Player
menu, this is the main mode of
the game. Here you race in cups
in differing CC classes, where
you can unlock more characters
and carts, and generally have a
good go at the courses. There
are four CC classes - 50CC,
100CC, 150CC and 150CC Mirror
(you have to unlock this) and
within these are 8 Cups, each
with four courses to race in.
With these four courses you are
awarded points according to the
position you come in.

1st - 10 Points
2nd - 8 Points
3rd - 6 Points
4th - 4 Points
5th - 3 Points
6th - 2 Points
7th - 1 Point
8th - 0 Points

After the four races your points
are totted up and if you get the
most points you get awarded
Gold. Hurrah! You also get a
rank based on your performance.
This rank goes from E to ***,
and this is mostly dependant on
time. Although you may have
heard other things, or think the
ranking is like it was in Mario
Kart Super Circuit on the GBA
then it's wrong; it's *mostly*
based on time. As you as you
finish a good while in front
with a great time on each
course, without smashing into a
lot of items or off cliffs then
you should get a *** ranking.
You can even use items, but I
assume not *loads*. It helps if
you can snake a little too.


-----------
Time Trails
-----------

Here you can just race on the
course of your choice, practice
up and set a best time. You get
just one mushroom as far as
items go, so use it wisely. On
the touch screen map you can see
what route you take thanks to
sets of arrows, with blue
showing a normal route, yellow
showing drift, red showing a
drifting boost and a mushroom
symbol for you-know-what. You
save ghosts here so you can race
yourself again later, and even
compete against Staff Ghosts
(see the Unlockables section
toward the end of the guide to
see more on this).


---Vs.
---

This is basically where you can
make a custom race between you
and the computer. You can set
things like CC Class, Opponent
difficulty, Courses, Rules (like
upto X amount of Wins, Points or
just a free game) and Teams
(which is quite interesting. Of
course the Multiplayer mode, you
face your friends instead.


------
Battle
------

Here you face off against other
karts in a battle like arena,
playing one or two games. For
the first time in a Mario Kart
game you can now practice
against the computer, a welcome
move. The two modes are...

Balloon Battle - Use Items to
pop your opponents balloons
until they are all
    gone! Each kart has up to
    five balloons, where three
    are blown up at any one time
    (use the mic or SELECT
    button to blow more up) and
    fight away!
Shine Runners - From Mario Kart:
Double Dash!! This is where you
collect as
    many shines as possible.
    Once a shine has been
    collected another will
    regenerate elsewhere, and
    after a while you must fight
    others for them. If you
    don't have enough you get
    kicked out so put up a good
    fight and use items to steal
    shines off others!


--------
Missions
--------

These are short missions where
you have to perform tasks before
the time limit is over. This
includes collecting coins,
driving through gates,
collecting Item Boxes and more.
There is also a boss stage at
the end of each mission set. In
each level are 8 missions and a
Boss Stage, with a total of 7
levels (level 7 has to be
unlocked by getting at least a *
ranking on all the other
missions).


------------------------
Nintendo WiFi Connection
------------------------

Online! Yes! To play online you
need a wireless (or WiFi)
internet signal. This could be
at home, work, school, McDonalds
etc. or you can use a Nintendo
WiFi USB Connector (check
online, such as at Amazon for
this). Before you can play you
need to connect and configure
your signal. Go into Settings
and then the Connection set up.
Where you can add a Connection
(upto 3) as well as a simple way
to connect to a USB Connector.
DO NOT EMAIL ME ABOUT CONNECTION
HELP. I DO NOT KNOW. I heard
that shutting down your firewall
may make connections work
though. If you are having
trouble them contact the
Nintendo WiFi website or the
GameFAQs Mario Kart DS message
boards.

Once you get a connection
configured, you are ready to
race! You have Friends, Rivals,
Continental and WorldWide. Each
does what it says on the tin
really. You need Friends
searching for them to connect
and you need to ensure that you
have their code and they have
yours so you can play. Rivals
pits you against those of
similar skills. Continental is
where you play against those
from your Continent, and
WorldWide allows you to play
anyone from around the world.

To add Friends and send out a
Friend Code, first get a
connection set up and play
online, then a friend code is
generated for you. Go in to the
Friend Code section in the menu
to check yours; here is also
where you add other peoples. As
said above to play another gamer
you need to add each other to
your Friends lists in order to
play each other.

Some notes about online play.
There is no chat; no rooms or
mic talk. You cannot add
contacts online, so you have to
know that person in real life or
on the internet before you can
play them. You cannot dangle
items during a race and
sometimes lag will occur (they
move around quickly and
erratically during a race).
People may disconnect (if they
do, they receive a loss but you
don't get a win). Only up to 4
people can play online at once,
and worst of all only 20 of the
32 courses are playable online.

But aside from those 'notes'
Online game is real good fun and
worth trying at least once. If
you haven't got a wireless
network at home or near you then
I would say that it's worth
investing in a USB Connector
from a website.


-------
Records
-------

This is where you view your
times and records thus far. On
the top screen on the main menu
are your records against other
people, either in multiplayer
racing, battle, or online. There
are also sub-sections such as
Grand Prix (see the times and
rankings), Time Trails (best
times) and Friends (your records
against friends, both online and
off).


-------
Options
-------

There are two sections in here;
Settings and Edit. In Settings
you can change the sound type
and Locate Friend option (when
online if a friend is searching
for opponents you'll get a
notice when playing). Edit is
where you edit your emblem,
which will appear on your kart
in all modes including online.
Use the stylus to create your
own custom design. Pretty cool,
eh? There is a pretty cool
website where you can select an
image on your computer and get
it converted in to an emblem for
you to trace into Edit mode.

------------------
Driving Techniques
------------------

Rocket Start
------------
This performs a boost as the
race starts, very handy for
getting the advantage straight
away. To do it, at the opening
count down (3, 2, 1, GO!) press
and hold A when 2 is fading
away. If done right, you'll
boost away. Takes a bit of
practice but once you've got it
it's an invaluable technique.

Drift
-----
You can drift by holding down
the R button when going around
corners. It allows you to take
sharper corners without loss of
speed, so is good for many of
the game's course. To start it,
turn and press R to set the
direction, and you can also
adjust the direction of the
drift slightly by using the
d-pad as you go anyway.

Mini-Turbo
----------
This gives you a boost after
drifting. To do it, get into a
drift and tap left and right on
the d-pad to change the colour
of the sparks from your kart. It
should turn blue, then red if
you keep going. Once it goes red
releasing R will give you a
mini-turbo. The level of boost
will differ depending on the
kart, but it does give you a
worth while boost, so mastering
this will give you the
advantage. To pull off faster
boosts, then place the ball of
your thumb in the middle of the
d-pad so all is required is
slight lateral movement left and
right. This takes a while to get
used to and may start to hurt
after a few races, but it
enables you to pull off mini-
turbo again and again.

Snaking
-------
This is a very advanced
technique, where you perform
mini-turbo over and over again
in a snake like fashion. So say
you are on a straight, and you
are on the left; drift to the
right, and boost ahead so you're
on the right. Now drift to the
left and boost so you end up on
the left. Keep repeating this to
create a snake like movement
down the track, giving you a
huge advantage if done
correctly. As said it is very
advanced and so takes a lot of
practice to pull off, especially
as you got to pull off mini-
turbos very fast (use the method
I described above, with placing
the ball of your thumb on the
d-pad so less movement is
required). Snaking is what all
the pro's use and you'll need to
be able to pull it off to some
degree if you want to make it
online. Use Time Trial as a
place of practice!

Throwing Items
--------------
When you are using certain
items, such as shells and
bananas, you can throw them in
front or behind you by pressing
up and down respectively. You
can launch green and red shells
behind you and throw Bob-Ombs,
Fake Item Boxes and Bananas
ahead of you.

Dangling Items
--------------
You can drag certain items
behind you, by holding the L
button. This enables you to
block attacks from behind, such
as those pesky red shells, and
to time your item drops more
effectively. You can drag
bananas, green shells, red
shells, Fake Item Boxes and Bob-
Ombs.

Slipstreaming
-------------
By following the car in front on
a straight you can slipstream
and increase you speed. As they
are absorbing the wind they
leave a tail of less resistant
air in their wake, which allows
you to move in a slightly faster
manner. You can tell if you are
doing this as blue lines will
appear on your screen, and if
done long enough you can get a
boost which will allow you to
over take. Very handy if you
need to overtake others. However
watch out in case they fire a
shell or drop a banana.

Turning on the spot
-------------------
You can turn on the spot by
holding accelerate and brake
together (A and B) and turning
left and right. This is very
handy if you are driving the
wrong way, or for the Missions.

Recovering after falling off the
track
--------------------------------
If you just fell off the track
and are being lifted back on,
you can recover quicker by
pressing accelerate JUST AS you
touch the ground again to
receive a boost. Takes some
practice, but worth it even if
you are an experienced racer;
you never know when some heavier
kart is gonna knock you off the
track.


--------------------------------
Driving and Item Tips and
Tactics
--------------------------------

Here are some additional item
and driving tips that might come
in handy. Feel free to submit
any of your own!

• Coming off the track or
  hitting a wall slows you down
  to a literal crawl. So don't
  do it.
• If you are gonna cut out some
  of the track, subsidize the
  slowdown with a drifting mini-
  boost or better yet, a
  mushroom.
• Placing fake item boxes or
  bananas by real item boxes
  should block them from view of
  your opponents, meaning
  there's a chance they could
  drive in to them. Although the
  CPU might spot this against
  people in multiplayer and
  online it'll work better,
  unless they check the map
  before hand (which not that
  many do I'm afraid). It's also
  good if you want to 'replace'
  you current item with another
  by dropping it by the item box
  so you'll collect those in
  front.
• If you are in first place,
  then it's a good idea to drag
  an item behind you (or have a
  draggable item with you) in
  case you need to defend
  against shells and what not.
  It's a pain to have you lead
  wiped away by a cheap item at
  the last minute so try and get
  used to doing this. Of course
  you can't do this online but
  I'm *fairly sure* you can drop
  such an item before a shell
  hits you so it destroys it.
  Better than nothing anyway,
  right?
• If you are neck and neck with
  an opponent and coming up to
  item boxes, drop back slightly
  so you are a position behind
  them and grab an item. As in
  first place you cannot pick up
  red shells, doing this method
  could bag you one so you can
  take them out and take a
  substantial lead. Although
  this is incredibly annoying
  and cheap its a sure fire
  winner especially if you are
  on the final lap.
• Again like the above, if you
  are in a very close race then
  drop back a few positions and
  grab an item box. As items are
  based on position and not
  proximity, you could get
  something like Thunder, a Star
  or Three Red Shells. And who
  wouldn't want that, eh?
• If you are gonna use a red or
  blue shell then wait for them
  to get a slight lead,
  otherwise the red shell will
  just fly straight past them
  and the blue shell likewise
  and even worse take you out in
  the impending explosion (if
  they are in first anyway).
• If you have several (hopefully
  red) shells, then you can
  incapacitate a kart ahead.
  Fire one to spin them out, and
  then fire another as you go
  past them (where they've
  hardly had time to recover).
  By the time they have started
  going again proper, you'll
  have speeded ahead.

 2.03. Items
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Pick up an item box in a race
and you'll get an item. But do
you know how to use it properly
and to it's full advantages? If
not, read on... Note that I have
put How to Use and Defending
Against. The How to use part is
tips on how you can use it,
while the other is what
precautions you can take in
order to avoid or minimize the
impacts of the said item if
others have it. Remember than
you can often see what item an
opponent has either visually and
by their character icon on the
bottom screen. There is also a
position received section, which
will tell you what position(s)
you have to be in to get the
item - thanks to Mystic Aurora
for supplying this information!

------
Banana
------
Position Received - 1st How to
use - Press L to drop this
banana skin on to the track.
When a
   kart slips on to it they will
   slide out of control for a
   second or two. It will remain
   on the track until someone
   slips on it or until it is
   destroyed (by a shell or Bo-
   omb). Try and place bananas
   on parts of the track where
   most racers will go on to
   them such as thin ledges, the
   insides of tracks, in front
   of boosters and item boxes.
   You can also use them for
   defending by holding down L
   to dangle it behind you, so
   it's probably more handy in
   that respect.
Defending Against - If you see a
banana on the track, common
sense tells you
     to avoid it (well at least
     I hope it does ;D) so try
     and drive around it if you
     can; if you are on unsure
     if it's there on the track
     then look at the touch
     screen map and you'll spot
     it no problem. You can also
     blast them away with a Bob-
     Omb or a shell. If you see
     another racer with


-------------
Triple Banana
-------------
Position Received - 1st How to
use - This is basically the same
as a single banana (see above)
but
   with three. However unlike
   triple shells they don't spin
   around you but instead just
   dangle behind rather
   pointlessly. Use them to
   strategically place on the
   track and defend with if
   needed.
Defending Against - Again like
normal bananas, avoid driving
over them. If
     you see another player with
     them (it's visible) then
     avoid hanging around behind
     them as chances are they'll
     drop them straight on to
     your lap. The CPU tends to
     drop them about three
     seconds after one another,
     so remember this
if you are playing the GP modes.

-----------
Green Shell
-----------
Position Received - 1st How to
use - Press L to fire this
forward in a rather linear
fashion to hit
   other karts and cause them to
   spin out of control. Rather
   handy, but it's quite hard to
   hit other karts with. Better
   still is that you can fire
   them behind you by holding
   down on the d-pad, so check
   your touch screen map for
   those tailing and send a
   shell their way. If they are
   close enough then chances are
   they'll have little chance of
   getting out of the way. Green
   shells can bounce off walls a
   few times before behind
   destroyed, so if you in a
   narrow tunnel or area firing
   one off and escaping could do
   a spot of damage. Like
   bananas, you can dangle these
   behind by holding down the L
   button which is ideal for
   defending against other
   shells. Also shells can
   destroy bananas on the track
   if you need them disposed of,
   as well as boxes and enemies
   on the track.
Defending Against - Avoid shells
hitting you as you'll spin out
of control.
     Check your map to see if
     any are coming up behind
     you and where they are -
     you should be able to hear
     them as well, so you can
     dodge them well in time.
     Rivals too can fire shells
     behind them so if you are
     slipstreaming remember
     this.

---------
Red Shell
---------
Position Received - 2nd-6th How
to use - Press L to fire it
ahead of you, where it will home
in on the
   nearest kart and cause them
   to spin out. Even if you are
   a few corners away it'll
   follow the track and take
   them out. Rather handy, eh?
   Some points though; don't
   fire when they are too close
   as it'll just whizz by them,
   and the shell can hit corners
   so fire it in a reasonably
   open area. It can also hit
   bananas and other shells and
   get destroyed, but if that
   occurs then you're unlucky.
   Like green shells, you can
   fire it backwards (L+Down)
   and dangle it behind you. It
   WILL NOT home in if you fire
   it backward, but rather go in
   a straight line like a green
   shell would. I advise that
   you keep a red shell handy at
   all times for defense and for
   regaining a position if
   you've just been taken.
Defending Against - If one is
coming your way (you can hear it
or see it on
     the map) then simply dangle
     an item behind you and it
     should counter it. However
     sometimes it can hit you
     from the side (just after a
     corner for example) so try
     and get on a straight
     before it hits you. If you
     don't have an item, then
     just try and race on and
     hopefully it'll hit a
     corner of the track, but
     otherwise you are gonna get
     hit and in that situation,
     there isn't a lot you can
     do about it.

-------------------------
Triple Red / Green Shells
-------------------------
Position Received - 2nd-8th How
to use - These are three red or
green shells that rotate around
you. The
   shells themselves act like
   normal shells respectively,
   but the rotating aspect is
   very handy for several
   reasons. For one, it acts as
   an ever acting defense
   against other items. You can
   use it as a weapon by just
   ramming other karts and make
   them spin you (you'll lose a
   shell in the process mind)
   and it's great in case you
   drive into items like bananas
   as they are automatically
   taken care of. It's also
   great as having three shells
   is pretty sweet anyway.
   Remember just because you
   have three shells doesn't
   mean you have to waste them
   in one go. A good tip is when
   you take someone out with a
   shell from a reasonable
   distance, as you go by just
   before fire another to
   incapacitate them further.
   Very annoying for them, but
   great for you.
Defending Against - For general
shell defense see the red and
green shell
     tips above. When you notice
     another kart having three,
     avoid touching them for a
     start or you will naturally
     spin out. Don't try and
     take all their shells out
     with shells of your own as
     that's pretty pointless,
     you may as well let them
     fire them off so their
     defense is down
         for attacking.

----------------
Spiny Blue Shell
----------------
Position Received - 4th-8th How
to use - Fire it with the L
button and it'll fly off to
first place and
   explode there, causing an
   explosion that will take out
   those in the region too.
   Pretty sweet. If you have one
   and the first placed kart is
   quite close, hold off until
   they are further away as
   it'll take you out too. Oh,
   did I mention it'll also take
   out the items they are
   carrying as well? Pretty
   cool!
Defending Against - If one if
coming your way, there is little
you can do but
     bite the bullet. Dispose of
     your items just before as
     it'll destroy them anyway.
     If you hear it coming and
     there are other karts
     behind you, then you could
     try and drop back and catch
     them in the blast radius as
     well, and if you are really
     luckily, the shell could
     get them instead. You can
     also avoid getting hit by
     using a Star or a Boo
     Ghost, but otherwise as
     said most of the time
     you'll have to get hit, so
     don't get too annoyed if
     this happens a fair amount.

---------
Fake Item
---------
Position Received - 1st How to
use - Press L to drop a fake
item on the track. When rival
karts drive
   in to it they'll spin out. So
   basically, this is just like
   a banana but it looks
   different, and like a banana
   you can dangle it behind you
   as well for defending. I
   advise that you pop this by
   real item boxes to confuse
   other players, as well as in
   front of boosters and on
   areas of the track that are
   thin / where
     most karts race over.
Defending Against - You can spot
a fake item box via several
ways. Firstly,
     the ? is upside down and
     the box doesn't rotate. As
     you're not bound to notice
     this in a hurry, there are
     two other ways. The map
     will show if the item box
     is real or not; real ones
     are green boxes, fake are
     red. Finally other players
     especially the CPU will
     just place them anywhere on
     the track, so if you see a
     box on its own away from
     normal item box placements
     then chances are it'll be a
     fake one.

--------
Mushroom
--------
Position Received - 2nd-4th How
to use - Press L to boost your
karts speed for a second or two.
This is
   really handy for gaining a
   few places, and most of all
   for skipping sections of the
   track like corners or tacking
   advantage or certain
   shortcuts better. Just
   remember that you can't
   really stop once you've used
   the boost (say if suddenly
   realised you were going to go
   into a banana or off a cliff)
   so keep an eye out of where
   you are going to boost into.
Defending Against - Not a lot
you can do here. I guess you
could time a ghost
     to steal their mushroom,
     but others you'll have to
     let 'em be.


---------------
Triple Mushroom
---------------
Position Received - 2nd-4th How
to use - This is the same as a
normal Mushroom, expect you have
three.
   Predictable, eh? Remember to
   use them to cut corners of
   the track and to take full
   advantages of shortcuts. I
   would say a very important
   point is to make them last;
   on certain tracks there is a
   great shortcut you can take
   but only when using a
   mushroom, so it makes far
   more sense to save a mushroom
   for this every lap than to
   use them on one.
Defending Against - Once again
you can't really defend or stop
other karts from
        using mushrooms.

-------------------
Super Gold Mushroom
-------------------
Position Received - 4th-8th How
to use - Tap the L button while
the Gold Mushroom is active to
gain
   several boosts - so it's
   basically like an extended
   mushroom. It's based off time
   and not the amount of boosts
   you create, so once you've
   started using it use it to
   it's full advantage. Like
   normal mushrooms use them on
   corners and shortcuts, and
   not on thin ledges so you
   boost into a bottomless pit.
   Unless you want to.
Defending Against - Again, you
can't really defend or stop
other karts from
     using gold mushrooms.

-------
Bob-Omb
-------
Position Received - 2rd-6th How
to use - Press L to drop it
behind you, L+Up to throw it
ahead and hold L
   to dangle it behind you. A
   Bob-Omb explodes when other
   karts are near by, or it'll
   detonate after about five
   seconds. When it does it
   creates a huge explosion
   worthy of taking out several
   karts at a time. Where you
   place it is up to you - if
   there are loads of karts
   ahead then throw it ahead,
   otherwise just drop it
   behind. Another handy side
   effect is that it'll destroy
   the items of those involved
   in the explosion.
Defending Against - If you see a
bomb, drive around it as much as
you can.
     It detonates after it
     flashes red several times,
     but drive around it anyway
     even if it isn't going to
     go off soon.

-----------
Bullet Bill
-----------
Position Received - 6th-8th How
to use - A new item in Mario
Kart DS; press L to become a
Bullet Bill
   and fly along the track for
   about five to ten seconds on
   autopilot, taking out karts
   in the way. It also destroys
   their
  items, a great side effect.
Defending Against - If you hear
or see (on the map) a Bullet
Bill coming
     behind, drive out of the
     way as it seriously knocks
     you to the side, possibly
     off the track. It'll also
     destroy any items you are
     holding, so its worth
     diverting for a few seconds
     to avoid getting hit.

-------
Blooper
-------
Position Received - 3rd-6th How
to use - A new item in Mario
Kart DS; press L to make Blooper
spray ink
   on those in front of you. It
   will partially blind their
   vision for about 10-15
   seconds, or until they go
   over a booster. Most CPU
   carts drive like crazy once
   they get hit by this, so it's
   very handy in the Grand Prix.
   Try not to use it when your
   opponents are due to go other
   boosters, so time it to it's
   most effective timing.
Defending Against - If you get
hit, then you should be able to
drive fairly
     OK for a while but when it
     drops down a little and
     really clouds you vision,
     then rely on the touch
     screen map to drive for a
     short while. Try and drive
     over any boosters or use a
     mushroom if you can as
     that'll get rid of the ink
     instantly. Also mini-boosts
     will help a *little* but
     not much so if you don't
     mini-boost much anyway then
     continue
       racing as normal.

-------------
Boo Hoo Ghost
-------------
Position Received - 4th-8th How
to use - Press L to send the Boo
to steal items from other
characters.
   Your kart will also turn
   invisible and impermeable to
   damage as well. When using
   the Boo, think what you need
   it for. For example if you
   are using it to steal an
   item, check the touch screen
   map to see what items each
   opponent has so you know what
   possible items are up for
   grabs. Wait until you get a
   decent item then use it, and
   with some luck you should get
   it. Otherwise using it to
   stop damage is very helpful
   as well - such as avoiding
   red shells, lightning, or if
   you want to drive through
   cars and snow balls.
Defending Against - You should
hear when a ghost is being used,
so if you do
     you *might* not get your
     stuff taken, but then again
     you might so decide if you
     want to use your item in
     case of the latter.

-----------
Thunderbolt
-----------
Position Received - 6th-8th How
to use - Press L to make all
other karts shrink in size,
causing them to
   slow down. Unlike other Mario
   Kart games you can't run over
   the shrinked karts and make
   them flat, so just drive past
   them instead. Shrinked karts
   won't make big jumps, even
   boost ones, so if you can
   time it around them that's an
   advantage to you.
Defending Against - If you get
shrunk, then avoid jumps, even
boost ones, as
     you won't make it. Instead
     just wait around before
     them until you regain your
     size. Remember that you can
     still perform mini-boosts
     when you're small which is
     a great advantage in the GP
     modes, as CPU players won't
     do this when shrunk. You
     can prevent being shrunk by
     using a star, ghost, or if
     you happen to fall off the
     track at that time.

----
Star
----
Position Received - 6th-8th How
to use - Press L to use the
star, making you invincible,
giving you
   extra speed and removing
   terrain slowdown. So when you
   have it, run in to other
   karts and through any
   obstacles in your way and
   take advantage of shortcuts
   and cutting corners as you
   won't slowdown. A star lasts
   about eight seconds.
Defending Against - If you see
someone using a star then
they'll be brightly
     multi-coloured and have a
     star surrounding them on
     the map, so like when you
     see a bullet bill getting
     hit by one will throw you
     to side and destroy your
     item, so dive out of the
     way as best as you can. You
     cannot use shells or other
     items against them in this
     state, so just wait
until it's over and let 'er rip.

 2.04. Characters and Karts
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This section will give you the
lowdown on all the characters in
the game, as well as the karts
they have on offer.

----------
Characters
----------

In Mario Kart DS there are 8
default characters, and 4
unlockable ones (note that if
you don't want to know who they
are, then it's best advised that
you skip this section). While
each one is different
cosmetically, they all have
different weight affiliations
which impacts on their stats and
their racing styles. Here is
each character, their weight
class, and what impact they have
on their weight. Thanks to
Mystic Aurora for this
information.

Light - Peach (Weight - 11)
   Yoshi        (Weight - 14)
   Toad         (Weight - 17)
   Daisy*       (Weight - 8)
   Dry Bones*   (Weight - 20)
Medium - Mario (Weight - None)
  Luigi        (Weight - None)
   Waluigi*     (Weight + 2)
Heavy - Donkey Kong (Weight + 8)
   Bowser       (Weight + 17)
   Wario        (Weight + 10)
   R.O.B.*      (Weight + 17)

* These are the four secret
  unlockable characters!
Light - High Acceleration, Low
Speed, High Handling Medium -
Medium Acceleration, Medium
Speed, Medium Handling Heavy -
Low Acceleration, High Speed,
Low Handling


-----
Karts
-----

Each character has up to three
unique karts, however you can
later unlock others karts for
that character to use, which are
from the other racers (up to 7
and later, every other kart in
the game). This section outlines
the stats for each kart in the
game for each character. Thanks
to Mystic Aurora for suppling
the stats for each kart!

Speed - This dictates how fast
the top speed is. The higher the
Speed stat, the
  faster your kart can go
  overall. However usually high
  speed karts are dogged by low
  acceleration. For more
  experienced players.
Acceleration - The higher the
acceleration, the faster you can
recover back to
   higher speeds have stopping
   or slowing down. Very handy
   for beginners, and generally
   great overall.
Weight - This impacts on jumps
and nudging other players. Heavy
karts can
  smash through lighter karts,
  sometimes off the track, and
  they also fly less after
  jumps. This is usually tied in
  with low handling stats.
Handling - This higher the
handling the easier it is the
turn, very handy
  for this tight corners.
  Lighter karts usually have
  this stat.
Drift - A high drift stat
usually means that drift mini-
boosts are easier to
  attain, and that the effect of
  the boost is longer lasting.
Items - This dictates on what
items you are likely to get -
the higher the
  stat means chances are you'll
  get a better item, plus their
  effects are greater when used.

================================

 3.01. Nitro Grand Prix -
       Mushroom Cup
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

----------------
Figure-8 Circuit
----------------

Description - A simple circuit
that goes in a figure of eight,
as the
   name suggests.
Walkthrough - After a short
straight, there is a long and
tame left which can
   be drifted all the way
   through. After is a long
   straight, with another tame
   turn this time to the right.
   This is followed by another
   straight, and the check
   point.
Shortcuts - None. Other Tips -
Most of this track can be snaked
once you master it, and is an
   ideal track to practice it.
   This is due to the wide
   track, the long tame turns
   and the concrete either side
   of the track
 incase you over step the mark.


-----------
Yoshi Falls
-----------

Description - This a a circle
like track with two lanes, with
waterfalls and
   boosters making up various
   parts.
Walkthrough - At first you are
presented with two lanes; the
left over a
   bridge, the right over water.
   Take the right and boost over
   the water and then stick to
   the left lane for the
   remainder of the track, as
   there are boosters that
   populate it.
Shortcuts - None. Other Tips -
Stick to the inside of the turn
- ie the water in most cases
   to cover less ground so get
   slightly further ahead.
   However only do so if you can
   boost or mushroom to get over
   easy enough.



-----------------
Cheep Cheep Beach
-----------------

Description - A beach course
where you go through sandy
S-bends, round rocks
     and through a jungle.
Walkthrough - Drive onward and
drift round the right, then
stick to the left
   side until the boost jump at
   the end on to the sand. Drift
   to the right around the rock
   face, over the boost ramp
   then you'll reach an s-bend.
   While you can drive round
   this, you can cut the corners
   when the tide is low and also
   perform a great short- cut
   here (see below). Also watch
   out for the crabs. Past here
   are two troughs with small
   ramps to accompany them which
   you need to use if the tide
   is high. After this stick to
   the right and enter the
   rainforest area. There is a
   slight s-bend section here
   which you can drive straight
   through the middle of, where
   you'll
arrive back to the check point.
Shortcuts - After the second
booster ramp you'll reach a
sandy s-bend where
   the crabs are. You can cut
   this out and head straight to
   the small wooden ramps at the
   end using a mushroom boost
   through the shallow water.
   Check the ASCII diagram below
   for an approximate route to
   take.

Other Tips - When the tide is
down, you can cut the corners of
the S-bend a
   little if you aren't the
   taking the above shortcut.



---------------
Luigi's Mansion
---------------

Description - This track is
based on the GameCube launch
title, Luigi's
   Mansion. You go through a
   haunted mansion and the woods
   surrounding it, including a
   boggy swamp complete with
   possessed trees!
Walkthrough - Navigate the small
s-bend and head into the
mansion, where you
   head up the stairs and down a
   ramp. Drift round the two
   right angle turns into the
   basement, round the table and
   through the tunnel out into
   the courtyard. Navigate the
   turns here using drifting
   through a gate, past the
   first tree to the swamp. The
   aim here is the go across as
   much land as possible. Head
   on to the edge of the item
   box island, to the far end
   ridge to the end. Head to the
   island ahead, and right until
   you reach total dry land
   again. Get passed the tree
   and drift left to the check
   point.
Shortcuts - After you exit the
tunnel, a mushroom used on the
left can bypass
   the tree and the corner ahead
   shaving a few seconds off
   your time.

Desert Hills
------------

Description - A desert themed
course that wouldn't look out of
place of
   Super Mario Bros. 3 perhaps?
   Featuring Pokeys and a sun
   with
      fireballs... Yikes!
Walkthrough - Drift close to the
inside of this long right bend,
and the left
   and right turns after. Here
   you'll meet your first pokey
   which can he easily avoided.
   Over the hill is a straight
   with Pokeys and a few sets of
   Item Boxes. There is a long
   turn after this with a few
   sharp bends that should be
   drifted; there are item boxes
   on the outside of these
   turns, so if you don't mind
   sacrificing a few seconds of
   your time for these then go
   for it. After these is the
   check point straight. On the
   second and third laps
   fireballs with start to
   appear, on the second lap one
   to the right of the pyramid
   and in the twisty end
   section, and on the third
   just after the check point
   and at the twisty end
   section. To avoid them, go to
   where they have come from
   (you can tell by their
   firetrail that comes from
   behind them).
Shortcuts - After the first
bend, there is a pyramid to your
left. Use a
   mushroom down the dirt path
   to the left of this to shave
   a few
     seconds off your time.
  - On the last corner, you can
    use a mushroom just before
    to get over
   the large area of dirt on its
   right.
Other Tips - Due to the wide
nature of the course you can
easily snake and
   drift a-plenty throughout.


--------------
Delfino Square
--------------

Description - One of my favorite
courses this, it takes place on
Delfino
   Island on the GameCube title
   Super Mario Sunshine.
Walkthrough - Head up the hill
to the statue, where you have to
go clockwise
   around it (drift close to the
   inside) to where you have to
   go down a street. Drift to
   the left and grab an Item
   Box, then a right down a
   backstreet to where the path
   splits in to two. One is a
   tame turn down the left, the
   other is steps that head
   straight on. I find the
   faster route is straight on.
   Either path takes you to a
   group of item boxes and out
   to a bridge. Head left to the
   side market, where you will
   see some boxes to the side.
   Just behind this is a small
   back street shortcut that is
   well worth taking without a
   mushroom or otherwise despite
   the mud being there. On the
   out, take a right and over a
   booster suspension bridge,
   drift round the short right,
   on ward, then round the right
   angle to the check point.
Shortcuts - After the first
stone bridge, there are a few
boxes on the left.
   There is a small backstreet
   shortcut behind these that
   requires a sharp turn in to.
   Despite it being full of mud
   its much faster than the
   other route, mushroom or
   otherwise. It'll take you out
   to the booster bridge on the
   right after. By the way if
   you use a mushroom through
   this then take a sharp right
   or you'll end up in the
   drink!
  - You can use a mushroom
    through the grass after the
    suspension
   bridge.
Other Tips - Try placing bananas
and other items after the
suspension bridge,
   so they land straight in to
   them. Ha ha.


---------------
Waluigi Pinball
---------------

Description - A course in a
giant pinball machine! You start
off out of the
   ball chute, wind your way
   down the table and past the
   flippers where you start over
   again! Quite a fun course to
   race. :)
Walkthrough - Head straight up
the ball chute and drift around
the first
   corner on the inside, then
   over the ramp. Now you are on
   a wide and windy downhill
   track populated with giant
   pin balls. You can drift most
   of these corners fine, just
   watch out for the balls which
   are avoidable if you stick to
   the edges. After the booster
   ramp drift to the insides of
   corners until you reach the
   table itself. Stick to the
   center to avoid the bumpers
   and the balls, and straight
   down the middle past the
   flippers or you'll get
   smacked away. Drift round the
   two final right angled
 turns back to the checkpoint.
Shortcuts - None.
Other Tips - None.


------------
Shroom Ridge
------------

Description - A green-belt style
course along a road that scales
the edge of
   a mountain, through pleasant
   greens and a tunnel. The road
   is also choc full of roads
   and lorries that must be
   avoided! This track must be
   set in the UK or Australia
   due that everyone
    drives on the left. Ahh.
Walkthrough - Drift round the
left U bend, and stick to the
left side of the
   road for these next two blind
   turns to avoid getting hit by
   oncoming cars. After another
   left U bend is a straight
   next to some greens. After
   another few turns head
   through the tunnel to the
   mountain side, where you can
   easily fall off (so watch
   your drifting!). Stick to the
   left side of the road if you
   can to avoid on coming
   traffic in these last tight
   few turns to the finish.
Shortcuts - You can do a small
shortcut in the green area
before the tunnel.
   After the small bump up use a
   mushroom to cut the corner
   slightly to the left.
Other Tips - Stick on the left
as much as you can (at first
anyway) to avoid
   on coming traffic. You can
   squeeze down the side of a
   vehicle if one if going to
   hit you however.
  - Try and force other drivers
    into the vehicles, such as
    placing
   bananas and items on the left
   side of the road, and if you
   are using a heavy character
   ram them onto the right.
  - There are moving item boxes
    along the road, which you
    are free
   to collect.

DK Pass
-------

Description - Snow business like
DK Pass! *tumbleweed* This is a
snowy mountain
   level where you climb up one
   side and then down the other,
   with giant snow balls to
   avoid!
Walkthrough - Drift in to the
tunnel, and then drift into the
sharp left turn
   on the other side. Head up
   through the S-Bend and drift
   up the long left, where on
   the way you'll be greeted
   with a giant snowball. Avoid
   it and turn right and onward,
   followed by a long left
   that's worth drifting round.
   There is now a decent down
   with several small drops and
   snow balls to navigate past.
   At the end is a boost jump
   towards the final bend that
   is covered in mini snowmen.
   You can drift right round the
   inside of the corner and
   avoid touching any of them.
   You'll then arrive at the
   check- point.
Shortcuts - Before the decsent
down the mountain there is a
wide corner with
   a snowy mound on it's inside.
   If you head up this mound
   (which can be done with or
   without a mushroom) you can
   collect an item box which
   will always have three
   mushrooms in. Very handy!

spin out.


---------------
Tick-Tock Clock
---------------

Description - Based on the Super
Mario 64 level of the same name,
you race
   through a clock themed level
   with swinging pendulums,
   twisting cogs, moving hands
   and rotating faces!
Walkthrough - Drift round this
corner and up the ramp to reach
a large circular
   area with two hands of a
   clock rotating around. Avoid
   touching these and go round
   the outside using the booster
   panels to the other side.
   Progress down the ramp, drift
   right where you'll reach a
   swinging pendulum. To get
   past go to where it is or the
   opposite way is it traveling
   - trying to go the far end on
   most attempts doesn't work.
   Anyway continue right and
   onward to a row of rotating
   clock faces. There are four
   here, so go in the direction
   they are facing and close to
   the center as you can. So go
   round the right, then left,
   right and left. After are two
   small right angle turns and
   the final clock face, with
   one hand surrounded by item
   boxes. You can either go
   right round the very edge or
   in the direction it is going
   (at a reduced speed).
   Finally, go between two cogs
   to the check point.
Shortcuts - Going over the end
cog (in the direction you are
going) gives you
     a slight speed boost.
Other Tips - Try lacing bananas
and other items by the swinging
pendulum.


-------------
Mario Circuit
-------------

Description - As in all Mario
Kart titles, Mario Circuit
returns with its
   green hills, Goombas and even
   Mushroom Castle!
Walkthrough - Drift right then
dodge the Goobma's to reach two
s-bends. Drift
   around these and watch out
   for the fireballs from the
   Pipe Piranhas as you go round
   the second. Traverse through
   the tunnel and drift inside
   the very sharp left, which is
   followed by another left and
   an S-Bend that can be easily
   driven through. The track
   then ends with two wide
   u-bends to the checkpoint.
Shortcuts - On the second s-bend
with the piranhas, you can cut
the last bend
   out with a mushroom straight
   into the tunnel.
Other Tips - Firing a shell or
using other items on the
Goomba's will give you
   a mushroom.


----------------
Airship Fortress
----------------

Description - This level takes
place in a battle field of
airships from Super
   Mario Bros. 3! Avoid an
   onslaught of Bullet Bills,
   head through an airship and
   escape from a spiraling
   tower!
Walkthrough - The first part of
this course is a straight, where
you have to
   avoid oncoming Bullet Bills.
   After a few drops drift left
   then right to be boosted onto
   an airship. There are several
   NAME on the deck here, so try
   and perform a long drift
   right whilst avoiding them,
   followed by a left into the
   ship. There is a driftable
   u-bend into a hall, with some
   boxes and two flames at the
   far end (drive on the side
   that they are coming away
   from). Drift left onto a
   boost with propels you across
   the sky in to a tower, which
   spirals all the way down to
   the left. You can drift a few
   times here if you can. Out
   the bottom go right and stick
   on that side to avoid the
   collapsed road, with the
   course ending with a left and
   the checkpoint.
Shortcuts - None. Other Tips -
You can take out the NAME with a
well timed shell.
  - The boxes in the ship hall
    can be broken with a shell
    or driven
   in to, leaving bananas or
   mushrooms behind. Yes!

-------------
Wario Stadium
-------------

Description - Another Mario
Kart, another Wario Stadium!
Features ramps,
   boosts and rings of fire!
Walkthrough - Drift left, right
slightly and then round the long
left to
   a boost jump. After another
   long left is a mud field
   complete with booster
   islands. Boost between each
   island to get to the other
   side, with another left and
   two boost jumps through rings
   of fire. Note that lighter
   characters can be bumped in
   midair from other characters
   here and into the fire. After
   is a few snaking bends in
   mudfield with fire lines the
   dodge along the way. Stay on
   the right to boost twice over
   this hill, right over sets of
   terraces, drift left then one
   final boost jump to the
   finish.
Shortcuts - In the snaky bends
with lines of fire, you can cut
them out by
   using a mushroom through the
   mud.
Other Tips - Place items in
front of boosts to hopefully
foil other oppenants.


-------------
Peach Gardens
-------------

Description - Race around the
Mushroom Castle gardens,
complete with loose
   chain chomps and hedge maze
   like sections!
Walkthrough - Head onward onto
the island and exit on the first
left. Head
   onward and go clockwise round
   the flower bed, and up the
   ramp and clockwise around the
   square flower bed here and
   down to the hedge maze ahead.
   Here you must navigate
   through the blocks to the far
   end whilst dodging chain
   chomps. The other side has an
   incline, drift right round
   another flower bed to another
   decline to a hedge section.
   Here are just three cone
   shaped hedges to drive
   through; head round the first
   and then cut into the middle
   and out to the dirt track.
   There are moles that come out
   of the holes, so avoid these
   on to a path at the other
   end. There is one last right
   corner here which is easily
   driftable
      to the check point.
Shortcuts - Using mushrooms you
can boost through the flowerbeds
throughout
   the track.
  - The first square flowerbed
    you come across has a small
    path to
   the right of it, which shaves
   a second or two off your
   time.
  - For the dirt road section
    towards the end, mushrooms
    can cut out
   the corners.
Other Tips - Shells and other
items can take out the moles
that are on the
     dirt track at the end.


-------------
Bowser Castle
-------------

Description - The Castle is
back, featuring Thomps and other
traps! Walkthrough - Head
onwards over the bridge and
drive around the Thomps here.
   Drift around the next two
   right turns, up the steps and
   right again to reach a thin
   bridge to a revolving room.
   Drive straight over as best
   as you can and then along
   this corridor sticking to the
   left (a Thomp drops down on
   the right now and again).
   After a right and a left is a
   spiraling upward path which
   can be drifted (just don't
   fall!) to a revolving bridge.
   Try and remain on the bridge
   as best you can by stick to
   the middle and driving
   slightly against the turn,
   but if you fall you still
   continue underneath by
   heading left and round.
   Either way turn right and
   boost on to the moving
   platforms. As long as you
   have the far track ahead of
   you, you shouldn't fall (the
   platforms don't move far
   enough) and then continue
   right, left and then finally
   right
      to the check point.
Shortcuts - You know that
revolving room? Instead of going
straight over
   continue turning right to
   reach a corridor that links
   you straight to the spiral
   tower. However there is a
   flame and a Thomp in the way,
   so although it's faster it is
   a tad more risky.
Other Tips - Note that the
rotating path toward the end
does change direction
   from time to time, so be
   prepared for this as you go
   across.


------------
Rainbow Road
------------

Description - The usual finale
returns; Rainbow Road!
Personally I find this
   the best yet as it's just the
   right length, and contains
   some rather awesome spirals
   and loop-de-loop sections.
Walkthrough - Straight away
boosters will propel you along
the track, on to
   a spiraling left turn. It's
   hard to drift up here, so
   instead take advantage of the
   boosters all the way up.
   There are ones on the left,
   the middle, the right and
   finally on the left again.
   The path then flattens out
   and turns right slightly, to
   a loop-de-loop. Progress on
   ward and through the rings,
   drift right, drop down and
   move right slightly and drift
   the next left. Drift the long
   right and on to the booster
   corkscrew, a small right and
   a wide (driftable) left to
   the race finish.
Shortcuts - None. Other Tips -
Placing and firing items on the
loop-de-loop and corkscrew that
   knock people off the track
   will make them fall upward!
   Well, it looks that way as
   you're upside down but still
   it's pretty cool and puts
   them back a fair few
   positions.
  - If you are using a heavy
    character, then ramming
    other karts off
   the track is a good idea
   considering most of the edges
   haven't got barriers.
  - There is a rumor that you
    can skip out the giant loop
    by driving
   in to the side barrier and
   flying over to the other
   side. Although I've had a go
   I can't even get over it, but
   if anyone can manage this
   then please give me an email.

SNES Mario Circuit 1
--------------------

Description - Ahh, what a
classic. The first track from
the very first Mario
   Kart game, this is a simple
   yet sweet course to race.
   This is the third time the
   course has been in a Mario
   Kart game, thanks to the
   classic SNES tracks in Mario
   Kart: Super Circuit.
Walkthrough - Turn left and head
down the straight towards the
pipe ridden
   corner. Drift towards the
   inside to avoid the pipes and
   collect an Item Box. Drift
   into this tight left, along a
   small straight and drift
   right, finishing off with a
   long left toward the check
   point.
Shortcuts - You can cut a
portion of the track out using a
mushroom over the
   large dirt area, just after
   the load of Item Boxes.
Other Tips - Placing items
around the pipes will limit the
room opponents can
   travel though, hindering
   their progress.


----------------
N64 Moo Moo Farm
----------------

Description - A firm Mario Kart
64 favorite, Moo Moo Farm has
been recreated
   for the DS version. Although
   not as wide as the N64
   original, this track takes
   place through a wide dirt
   road.
Walkthrough - Progress onward
and over the bump and drift
right. Toward the
   end of this turn are some
   holes containing moles on the
   right side, followed by an
   s-bend and yet another
   through a bridge. There is a
   long and very tame right turn
   (with more holes on the right
   side) ending with columns and
   the check point.
Shortcuts - None. Other Tips -
Watch out for the columns toward
the end.


-----------------
GBA Peach Circuit
-----------------

Description - The first track
from the GBA Mario Kart, this is
a pretty
   simple track with a very
   rememberable first corner.
Walkthrough - The first corner
is a very sharp u-turn, so drift
around it and
   go onward to collect an item
   from the row of item boxes.
   Drift the left, right left
   combo of turns and again with
   the left turn shortly after.
   The course then finishes with
   tame right and left turns and
   sharp left then right
   corners.
Shortcuts - You can use a
mushroom to cut out a corner in
the turns after the
    first set of item boxes.
  - After the three turns is a
    slight right then left; you
    can use a
   mushroom to the left of the
   tree here to cut that out.
Other Tips - None.


-----------------
GCN Luigi Circuit
-----------------

Description - Somewhat similar
to the first track in Mario Kart
DS, this is a
   giant loop with two wide
   turns at either end. Again
   this is the first track of
   the GameCube Mario Kart game,
   Double Dash!! although they
   have excluded the side paths
   from before. No big deal
   however, as they were useless
   anyway.
Walkthrough - Not a whole lot to
this track; head onward down the
track (on the
   right side) to the far corner
   and drift around the boosters
   round the outside (or if you
   can drift and mini-boost, do
   so on the far inside) and do
   the same down the other end.
   Just watch out for the Chain
   Chomp on the right side
   before the first corner
   though. ;)
Shortcuts - None. Other Tips -
Once you can snake, doing this
track is extremely easy and
quick
   due to the wide nature of the
   course.

-------------------
SNES Donut Plains 1
-------------------

Description - Another classic
SNES track, with wide and long
corners and
   a cool lake. Ahh.
Walkthrough - Drift right on to
the bridge, followed by another
driftable
   right turn. Go left and then
   drift right, nice and close
   to the mud, followed by nice
   and long left and right
   corners. Again drift these
   close to the inside, where
   that's a lap!
Shortcuts - After the right turn
after the bridge, you can go
straight on
   and miss the corner via the
   gap in the barrier. Use a
   mushroom through this to make
   full advantage of it.
Other Tips - As the bridge is
thin, place a few items on there
to hinder your
   opponents.


-------------------
N64 Frappe Snowland
-------------------

Description - A snowy and to be
honest rather nasty level,
populated with
      horrid snowmen. Gah.
Walkthrough - Drift the first
right and left corners and stick
to the left to
   avoid the snowman in the
   middle of the track. Drift
   close to the inside of the
   next turn to avoid another
   snowman, which is followed by
   a soft long right and a
   drift-worthy left. Drive over
   the jump and collect an item
   box, and turn left into the
   snow man area. You have two
   choices here; go all the way
   around the area by going to
   the right of the ice statue,
   or drive through the snowmen
   (there is a path just to the
   left of the statue). This is
   followed by a tricky s-bend
   section (with snowmen on the
   right at the exit) and then
   on to a walled area. Collect
   an item box and drift along
   two left turns, then a final
   right on to a bridge and the
   check point.
Shortcuts - None. Other Tips -
If you are small (from a
Lightning bolt) then do not
attempt to
   go over the jump before the
   snowmen area. You'll just
   fall down in to the stream
   below. You can turn this trap
   to your advantage if you time
   a Lightning bolt correctly of
   course.
  - The end walled section is
    very snakable if you can do
    it.


-------------------
GBA Bowser Castle 2
-------------------

Description - One of four of the
Bowser Castle courses from the
Game Boy
   Advance Mario Kart, this has
   contains a lot of Thomps,
   lava pits and right angled
   turns to contend with!
Walkthrough - Perform a single
drift round these first two
corners so you
   end up on the left side for
   the booster panel. Do a
   similar drift for the other
   end, and head left of the
   Thomp and end up on the far
   left in this mesh area and
   turn right. There a booster
   here but remember to move to
   the left straight after to
   avoid the Thomp that is
   beyond. Either way turn right
   over a booster jump and stick
   to the right side to take
   advantage of the item box at
   the end. Drift right and here
   remain on the far right for
   the boosters and to avoid all
   the bogus lava pits. Drift
   right and head straight to
   the check point while
   avoiding the two Thomps.
Shortcuts - None. Other Tips -
DRIFT ROUND CORNERS. They are
mostly right angles so it's very
   useful and important if you
   do so.
  - The last mesh area has many
    bogus lava pits - ie.
    booster
   jumps that lead you across
   pits that are too big for you
   to land in. Just stick to the
   far right if you please.


-------------
GCN Baby Park
-------------

Description - There's mixed
reception for fans of Double
Dash!! about this
   track; some loved it, some
   thought it was pointless and
   rather cheap. Why? It's just
   a loop. A small loop at that.
   And note that although the
   GameCube version had 7 laps,
   the DS one has 5. Hmm.
Walkthrough - Drift right so you
start wide, go close and exit
wide. Do the
   same with the other side, and
   repeat. Remember to use items
   to your advantage - they do
   cross over the middle section
   so watch out and check on
   your map from time to time
   from shells coming from all
   over the place. If you can
   mini-boost and snake then
  doing it here really helps.
Shortcuts - You kidding? None.
Other Tips - Learning to mini-
boost and snake really helps
here to put an
 advantage over your opponents.

Remember on all classes you need
to beat the Shell and Banana
Cups to unlock this cup.

------------------
SNES Koopa Beach 2
------------------

Description - A beach course
that is effectively a big
circle, including a
   nasty water section where a
   mistake lands you in the deep
   end.
Walkthrough - Drift left until
the item boxes are close, and do
it again
   until you are close to the
   Cheep Cheep. This water
   section has both light and
   dark shades of blue; stay on
   the lighter shade as you'll
   instantly fall down the
   darker shade and have to get
   dropped back on again. Head
   down the right side to avoid
   most of the nasty parts and
   to sample one of the three
   item boxes. Drift round the
   rest of the corners now,
   until you reach the shallow
   bit of water that you can
   drive through, to the check
   point.
Shortcuts - None. Other Tips -
You can hit Cheep Cheeps with
shells and other items. How
jolly!


------------------
N64 Choco Mountain
------------------

Description - There was a phrase
that we all used to say when
playing multi-
   player on the N64 version.
   "Everyone loves Choco
   Mountain!" That's because
   it's a damn awesome track,
   and I'm pleased that it's
   been faithfully recreated in
   this version, minus the whole
   boulder crushing, so it's
   even better! Yes!
Walkthrough - Drift right, turn
right, left and then a long
drift right to a
   straight with a tunnel at the
   end. Go round the long left,
   drive (don't drift) through
   this tight s-bend, and drift
   through the item boxes, left
   and over the jump. Onward,
   and where abouts the orange
   sign post is start drifting
   around this turn. Don't worry
   about the falling boulders;
   most of the time they won't
   hit you and if they do you've
   been quite unlucky. Anyway,
   drift right and grab an item
   box, right again and over
   three mounds to the check
   point. Now wasn't that fun?
   :D
Shortcuts - None. Other Tips -
From the boulder section up to
the three end mounds, DO NOT
fall
   of the edge, as you'll have
   to race back up again. It's a
 serious pain if that happens.
  - Planting items behind the
    last three mounds works a
    treat,
   especially the third and
   final one.
  - If you use a mushroom on the
    first of the final three
    mounds
   before the check point (using
   a light character) you'll
   bounce off the third mound
   and pretty much fly over the
   finish. Awesome.


-----------------
GBA Luigi Circuit
-----------------

Description - The only wet
course ever, this track rains
throughout with
   puddles situated all over the
   shop. It's also choc full of
   u-turns, so I hope your R
   button is ready.
Walkthrough - Turn left then
drift wide left (to avoid the
puddles) as well
   as drifting the next right
   u-turn. Avoid the puddles on
   the left side, drift the
   sharp u-turn and drift into
   the s-bend to the right, and
   do the same again whilst
   going out. Again drift the
   next two u-bends and simply
   drive straight through the
   middle of this windy section
   finishing off with drifting
   the last two u-bends and
   staying in the middle of the
   track (puddles at the edges)
   to the check point.
Shortcuts - None. Other Tips -
Drift round the u-turns, please.
  - You can leap over puddles if
    you need to.


-------------------
GCN Mushroom Bridge
-------------------

Description - Quite a cool
GameCube track, this takes on a
busy road populated
   with cars, taking you through
   several tunnels and you
   guessed it a bridge. Like the
   other GameCube tracks they
   have some elements missing,
   such as the right path from
   the start that leaded to a
   useless pipe and the ability
   to go on the sides of the
   metal bridge. Still, it's
   mostly in there and it looks
   great. :)
Walkthrough - Drift left into
the tunnel, and stick to the
middle or edges to
   progress past traffic. On the
   exit drift left and then
   inside right. Just onward is
   another tunnel, so drift left
   through here with the bridge
   on your exit. Again stick to
   the edges or the middle to
   avoid traffic until you reach
   the check point.
Shortcuts - After the first
tunnel, instead of going left
you can use a
   mushroom to drive over the
   dirt track hill to miss out a
   section of
     the track. Very nice.
Other Tips - Traffic drives on
the both sides of the road, so
stick to the
   middle or sides when
   overtaking, otherwise stick
   to the insides of roads.
  - There are moving item boxes
    along the road, which you
    are free
   to collect.

-------------------
SNES Choco Island 2
-------------------

Description - This track, I
find, incredibly annoying. The
whole mud aspect
   in the middle and the bumpy
   end section isn't that nice
   to be honest. The weakest of
   the SNES tracks in my
   opinion.
Walkthrough - Drift left, then
drift left then right to a thin
path through
   several piranha plants. Drift
   right to a massive mud field,
   where on the left is an
   island with some item boxes.
   After is a load of bump ramps
   scattered everywhere, and if
   you are in a light kart
   you'll go flying, so try and
   remain on the ground at all
   times (you can't jump them,
   either). After the item boxes
   stay on the right side to
   miss most of them here, and
   finish with a drift to the
   right and race to the check
   point.
Shortcuts - Straight ahead from
the start is a gap in the
barrier, which can
   be made via a mushroom
   skipping out the first two or
   so turns.
Other Tips - If you can snake,
then do so over the mud section
to cut down
   on time.


---------------------
N64 Banshee Boardwalk
---------------------

Description - One of the Special
Cup N64 tracks, this is a ghost
house themed
   level set at a dock or some
   sorts. Half is on wooden
   walkways, the other is in a
   building populated with bats.
Walkthrough - Drift left then
right, and go onward and collect
an Item box.
   Drift left and follow the
   track. When the barrier
   disappears, DRIVE through
   this s-bend, drop down and
   drift left in to the
   building. Drive right around
   the wall and go left out of
   the way of the bats, then
   drift right around the wall
   and through the item boxes,
   where ahead and to the left
   slightly is the building
   exit. Drift right here, then
   race down the straight take
   the last two turns and head
   straight down towards the
   check point.
Shortcuts - When you enter the
building, instead of going right
head left
   and head around the wall to
   more or less cut out the
   bats. It's the slightest of
   shortcuts, I know.
  - A more useful shortcut in
    the building however is
    this. When you
   enter turn right as normal
   but as you meet the bats,
   turn left and jump across the
   gap to the left of the wooden
   beam. It does shave a second
   or so off your time, so is
   somewhat handy.
Other Tips - This isn't the
easiest of tracks to navigate,
so walk before you
   can run here (ie. practice
   before you start drifting).


--------------
GBA Sky Garden
--------------

Description - My favorite of the
GBA tracks, Sky Garden takes
place in the
   skies as you race across
   clouds. Quite cool, and well
   as having
 a fair few shortcuts to boot.
Walkthrough - Drift left and
turn left and over the booster
jump. Follow the
   track right and drift to the
   left, and go on ward. Here
   you can go round the u-bend
   normally, use the jump over
   the gap to get an item box or
   use the shortcut (see below).
   Either way you will end up at
   a bridge, so drift right onto
   the track again and follow
   the track for a short while.
   Drift round the sharp right
   turn, on to the bridge and
   drift off again. Drift the
   final corner and avoid the
   booster jump (it's useless
   and I'm fairly certain it
   slows you down a little) and
   continue onward to the
   finish.
Shortcuts - After the first
turn, you can use a mushroom on
the small wooden
   ramp ahead on to some clouds
   beyond with links you to the
   track a little later on. To
   be honest this doesn't cut
   that much of the track off as
   the clouds you land on slow
   you down a fair bit, so
   unless you are using triple
   mushrooms or a golden
   mushroom, save you single one
   until the next shortcut.
  - Where there is a small
    booster ramp (with an item
    above), to the
   right is a small wooden ramp.
   Using a mushroom here will
   fly you straight onto the
   bridge, cutting a fair few
   seconds. Very handy.
  - The final shortcut is toward
    the end. Just before the
    green bridge
   is a cloud filling the gap.
   You can jump these gaps (R
   button) or drive straight
   over using a mushroom here to
   skip the bridge and save some
   time. Even with jumping it's
   a time safer, so adopt this.
Other Tips - Take note of the
useful shortcuts above, as they
are very handy.
  - Once you know how to snake,
    then it can be performed in
    most
   sections of this track for
   great results.


-----------------
GCN Yoshi Circuit
-----------------

Description - One of the better
GameCube tracks, you'll race
along the outline
   of Yoshi! Very nice. Again
   some shortcuts from the
   GameCube version are gone,
   such as the tunnel shortcut
   but apart from that it's all
   here. :)
Walkthrough - Drift around the
first few turns and perform a
long drift around
   the stone archway that sticks
   out. Continue in to the long
   tunnel, again most of which
   can be drifted. There is a
   sharp left on the exit, and
   most of the following turns
   are too small or sharp to be
   drifted so just go normally.
   When you reach the sharp
   stone wall turn (a yellow
   sign will tell you when)
   drift it and progress onward.
   The track then finishes with
   a right u-turn, a left and a
   final right (all of which are
   driftable) and then back to
   the check point.
Shortcuts - After the first few
turns is the stone archway that
the road goes
   around. However with a
   mushroom, you can boost
   straight over and end up to
   the tunnel. Well worth saving
   a mushroom for. However when
   you come out the other side
   turn right to avoid falling
   into the water below!
Other Tips - None.

================================
        ---------------
          4. MISSIONS
        ---------------
================================

These are short missions where
you have to perform tasks before
the time limit is over. This
includes collecting coins,
driving through gates,
destroying Item Boxes and more.
There is also a boss stage at
the end of each mission set. In
each level are 8 missions and a
Boss Stage, with a total of 7
levels (level 7 has to be
unlocked by getting at least a *
ranking on all the other
missions).


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 4.01. Level 1
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-----------
Mission 1-1
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 5
numbered gates in order!

The first mission takes place on
8-Figure Circuit, where you'll
go round the first corner going
through gates. There are
mushrooms to drive in to before
each one, which will increase
your speed. Overall very easy.
To get a higher rank, then do a
boost start, use all the
mushrooms and perform mini-
boosts between some of the
gates.


-----------
Mission 1-2
-----------

Objective - Collect all 15
coins!

Drive onward and collect the
first few coins, and drift into
the coins and release the drift
to collect all the rest. Just
ensure that you drive past them
first time and you should get a
high rank.


-----------
Mission 1-3
-----------

Objective - Destroy all 10 item
boxes!

All the boxes here are located
on the left side of the track.
Each box contains a mushroom, so
as soon as you get it tap L to
stop the item selector and L
again to use it toward the next
box. However half way through
use them strategically, so that
you can boost when not going
over the ground boosters.


-----------
Mission 1-4
-----------

Objective - Get the star and use
it to hit 5 Cheep Cheeps!

Quite a tough mission, use the
boxes for stars and then ram in
to each of the Cheep Cheeps on
the beach. The thing is when you
approach them they jump away, so
you'll need to approach them
slowly and ram into them that
way. Take it nice and easy,
you'll have enough time. If you
do it first time with one star,
you'll manage a very high rank.


-----------
Mission 1-5
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 6
numbered gates in order!

Drive straight onward through
the first gate, then drift left
and through the second and onto
the third. Drift through the
four and left, onward to five
and finally drift left to the
sixth. If you manage mini-boosts
as you drift then you'll get a
high rank.


-----------
Mission 1-6
-----------

Objective - Drive out of the
mansion... backward!

As you'll be driving backward
out of the mansion, you'll be
needing the B button (not A) for
reverse, and that left turns you
right and right turns you left,
okay? This shouldn't be too
hard, head down the ramp, around
the corner, right as you exit
(exit a bit wide to avoid the
table against the wall), around
the centre table and out the
tunnel beyond to finish. To get
higher ranks stick close to the
corners.


-----------
Mission 1-7
-----------

Objective - Collect all 20
coins!

Drive onward and grab the item
box; triple mushrooms and head
onward. Use two before the
corner, and drift around it. Use
the third mushroom through the
centre of the holes and collect
the last few lines of coins.
Mini-boost round the corners to
get faster and times, and so
higher ranks.


-----------
Mission 1-8
-----------

Objective - Perform 4 power-
slide turbo boosts in 1 lap!

To turbo boost, drift (R and a
direction) and alternate between
left and right until the sparks
turn blue, then red. Stop
drifting (let go of R) to boost!
As there are five corners on
this track and the first corner
is pretty much straight away,
you'll have to perform boosts on
the remaining corners. Drift on
the inside of the pipe corner to
avoid the pipes, drift early for
the next tight turn and the last
two are easy enough.


----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Use Mushrooms to
crash into the Big Bully and
knock him off the
   stage!

Very easy this boss; don't turbo
start as he'll ram you straight
away and if you do you'll fly
back even more. So start
normally and accept the ram,
drive round him and collect the
item box for triple mushrooms.
Turn round and use the mushrooms
to knock him off the stage (he
should be right at the edge now)
and you'll bag an easy three
star rank.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 4.02. Level 2
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-----------
Mission 2-1
-----------

Objective - Crash into all 10
wooden crates and destroy every
one!

Perform a starting boost and
take out the first three crates.
Now ahead is the dock area;
smash into the top one, go down
the ramp and into the next one
at the corner, and finally the
one at the end of the peer. Now
turn around on the spot (A and B
together plus a direction) and
head back up the ramp and back
on to the street, taking a hard
right. Drive in to the remaining
boxes ahead, drift around the
bridge, right and into the final
wooden box by the grassy area.
Remember to have a decent speed
before hitting the box,
otherwise it won't smash. If you
manage to mini-boost when
drifting and turn on the spot
you should attain high ranks.


-----------
Mission 2-2
-----------

Objective - Collect all 10
coins!

Reverse and grab the coin
behind, then proceed onward and
collect the rest. If you drift
round the corner, and perform a
mini-boost if you can, you can
easily get a three star rank
here.


-----------
Mission 2-3
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 5
numbered gates in order!

Drift on to the bridge and
through the first numbered gate,
drift right and straight ahead
to take advantage of the
shortcut to use the mushroom and
to head through the second gate.
Drift right and through the
third gate on the end of the
corner, move right slightly and
when you go over the next
mushroom and through the forth
gate hold left to make the
corner. For the fifth gate there
are two mushrooms before it; as
Donkey Kong has poor handling
you'll need to hold right a fair
amount to make sure you get
through the gate with the
mushrooms. If you mini-boost
when drifting the first few
corners and take advantage of
all the mushrooms you'll get a
high rank!


-----------
Mission 2-4
-----------

Objective - Destroy all 5 item
boxes!

Item boxes will race down the
track, and you'll have to chase
and drive into them to destroy
them. Remember that each
contains a mushroom, so make
sure you use it before you grab
the next one so it isn't a
waste. It's fairly easy unless
you are looking for a high rank,
in which case do the following.
Perform a turbo start and drive
slightly left to catch the first
as it exits the first corner,
and use the mushroom to get the
second as it exits the second
corner. Mushroom up the path to
catch up with the next as you
enter the mansion, and again to
get the next on the ramp. Use
the mushroom to catch the fifth
and final box as it takes the
ramp U-turn wide (take it as
it's between corners) and you
should get a starred rank.


-----------
Mission 2-5
-----------

Objective - Collect all 20
coins!

A very easy mission, simply
drive round the corner
collecting the coins, take the
booster jump *straight on* (very
important to catch those mid air
coins) and collect the remaining
few. You can attain a three star
rank even without mini-boosting.


-----------
Mission 2-6
-----------

Objective - Use Bob-ombs to
destroy all 5 Pokeys!

Use Bob-Ombs in the item boxes
to throw at the Pikeys. They
will explode on impact,
otherwise if they miss or are
dropped they explode after about
5 seconds and as long as the
Pokey is caught in the blast
radius then it'll be destroyed.
The fastest way is as follows -
boost start and grab the far
right item box, and chuck it at
the right Pokey. Reverse over
the same item box and take out
the right one. Do the same with
the two ahead, and grab another
for the fifth and chuck it at
him to take a high rank.


-----------
Mission 2-7
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 10
numbered gates in order!

Head onward, through the first
gate and over the boost. Now go
on to the left side of the road
(the opposite side) and drive
through the next gate. Grab an
item box and drive on the right
for the third gate. Use the
mushroom from the item box and
to the corner for the forth
gate, and on to the boosts on
the track side for the fifth.
Continue back on the straight
and head through the sixth gate
ahead, and the seventh and
eighth on the left side, the
ninth toward the corner and the
tenth and final gate is on top
of the corner (on the higher
path next to the boosters). For
the highest ranks try snaking,
which is mini-boosting over and
over.


-----------
Mission 2-8
-----------

Objective - Perform 6 power-
slide turbo boosts iin 3 laps!

You have three laps on Baby Park
to do this, which is one per
corner. Start out wide and drift
in close, then let go as you
leave the corner. If you miss
one you can do one on one of the
straights or two on one corner
if you can manage it, but I
would say restart otherwise. For
higher ranks, use the stars in
the item boxes to achieve faster
times.


----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Hit the Eyerok's
eyeball 3 times with shells!

You face two stone hands with
eyes on each palm; fire a shell
when an eye is open to hit it.
Check on your map to see when
the eyes are open or closed.
Here is a walkthrough. Turbo
start and bomb through the
middle of them and collect the
end item box for the first
shell. Now straight away turn
around and take out the hand
ahead for one hit. Carry on
driving, collect the next item
box and turn around. Drive right
a little, and wait for the far
hand to unclench and move right,
where the eye will open. Fire
the shell for the second shot.
Now collect the item box to the
right and turn around. At this
point the hands will clench and
together will move left and back
right again; wait where you are,
and when they return they will
unclench and turn around and the
eye will face you. Fire for the
third hit and if you managed it
quick enough, three stars will
be yours.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 4.03. Level 3
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-----------
Mission 3-1
-----------

Objective - Destroy all 5 item
boxes!

Set in the table on Waluigi's
Pinball course, you have to
chase and collect all five
boxes. The fastest route is this
- turbo start and go just left
of the above bumper, where a box
will come in from the left. Two
will then come the right in to
you (you may have to move right
slightly for this third box),
then drive onward for the one
moving right against the
barrier, and now the fifth will
arrive here a few seconds later
- look at the map and move the
kart so it goes in to you
(reverse). Done in about 7
seconds, that's a three star
ranking! If you don't understand
the order and position of that
walkthrough, check the below

-----------
Mission 3-2
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 5
numbered gates in order...
backward!

Fairly easy, as long as you
remember that B is to reverse
and the directions too are
reversed. Go through the first
gate, and then left down the
side street. The gates are on a
loop, so head straight down the
stairs, round and up the ramps
the other side to the fifth gate
to finish.


-----------
Mission 3-3
-----------

Objective - Collect all 15 coins
while avoiding the Chain Chomp!

A very easy mission to complete;
there is a line of coins going
round a Chain Chomp. As long as
you just collect the coins the
Chomp won't even bother you. Tap
the acceleration as you are
turning to ensure that you don't
miss any coins.


-----------
Mission 3-4
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Yoshi!

You have to race Yoshi to the
finish on Yoshi Falls. You'll
have to track the right side of
the track for the first section
(the other side is closed off)
so use any items you collect and
/ or drift and mini-boost
through the water. Then move on
to the left and use the booster
pads to the finish. You
shouldn't have to worry about
Yoshi, as he is a complete slow
poke here. If you want higher
ranking then use the items you
receive and perform mini- boosts
or snake where you can.


-----------
Mission 3-5
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 8
numbered gates in order!

Drive straight on though the
first gate and straight on to
the pipe and into gate two. Go
round the corner to gate three,
and right again through four and
enter the pipe. You'll appear on
the ground again and through
five, onward past the ramp,
drift through six, up the ramp
to seven and drive off the edge
back in to the central area
where the eighth and final gate
resides. To get higher ranks
mini-boost when turning.


-----------
Mission 3-6
-----------

Objective - Hit Monty Moles with
shells 5 times!

You have three item boxes ahead
of you, with seven holes in
front of them with Moles popping
out. They will stick their head
out then jump out fully about
half a second after. The key is
to fire a shell just as you see
their head pop out. So get a
line between a item box and a
hole, then get a shell and sit
about halfway between the two.
As soon as you see the head pop
out, fire the shell and reverse
back, grab a shell and go back
to the middle. If you were quick
enough with the shell it should
have hit him, and you then
repeat this over and over. This
is the quickest method. Other
methods include sitting in front
of a hole and dangle the shell
behind you (which should earn
you at least a A or one star
rank) or to line up with two
holes in front of you and to sit
on an item box and keep tapping
the L button so that as the
boxes regenerate you'll fire a
shell (but you'll be lucky to
pass using this). So use the
first method and you can get a
high ranking with that with
enough practice.


-----------
Mission 3-7
-----------

Objective - Perform 10 power-
slide turbo boosts in 1 lap!

Shroom Ridge this time. There
are more than 10 corners here (I
think) so as long as you drift
and boost on pretty much every
corner you should make it.
Remember to stay on the left
lane so you are going with the
traffic (especially on blind
corners) such on the second and
third corners a lorry comes
round on the right lane that
could take you out. The higher
ranks requires boosts on every
corner and to avoid touching the
edges or any vehicles.


-----------
Mission 3-8
-----------

Objective - Collect all 20
coins! You have to navigate
through a series of rooms to
collect all 20 coins. However as
rooms and routes are blocked off
you have to get them in a
certain order - also banana
skins block your path in places,
where hitting one will cause you
to lose all of your coins. If
this happens then restart.

Anyway a walkthrough. Accelerate
onward for coin (1), through to
the next room and left to
collect the second (2). Head
outside and round to the next
room with the next in the
doorway (3) and turn right and
collect the coin by the barrier
(4). Turn around, through the
room and head right outside for
a coin (5) and drive around the
banana skin in to the room and
collect the coin (6) as you head
in to the next room. Collect the
coin here (7) then go left and
outside to the walkway. Grab the
coin at the corner (8) and go
right and onward to a banana and
coin (9). Turn right and around
the central block of barriers
for coins (10) and (11) and exit
the same way you came in. Drive
on the left for coin (12) and
then right for coin (13), round
the corner and right into the
room. Collect the lone coin in
this room (14) and travel around
the edges of the room for coins
(15-20) to finish.

Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Goomboss!

You have to race Goombass, a
giant Goomba around three laps
of Baby Park. Basically race
like you would normally do and
drift and mini-boost round each
corner. Goomboss will nudge you
out of the way some times but
keep going, and dodge the
Goomba's he generates. Each lap
at the finish he grows bigger
and stronger, but drive around
him as he does this and keep
going as normal. He drops
mushrooms around the track too
so use those where you can, but
it isn't too hard to finish
first.

 4.04. Level 4
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-----------
Mission 4-1
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Donkey Kong!

Here you race Donkey Kong on
this own turf - DK Pass -
backward! Kinda strange but its
still pretty easy to win. Drift
on the inside of the first
corner to avoid the snowmen, you
can still grab an item box just
after booster, and also go up
the side ledge and grab the
triple mushroom item box to gain
a real advantage and you'll do
this easily. If you perform
mini-boosts while drifting as
well, you'll bag a high rank
with no problem.


-----------
Mission 4-2
-----------

Objective - Blast 20 crabs!

Its remarkably easy to get a
three star rank here. Use the
item boxes on this central
island and take out the
surrounding crabs. You have
either triple green shells,
single green shells or Bob-Ombs.
With triple shells you can drive
into crabs to take them out, and
Bob-Ombs to throw or lay near a
group of them. They will advance
on the island after a short
while making them easier to take
out. As long as you finish by
the 1 minute mark you'll get a
high rank.


-----------
Mission 4-3
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before the red car!

Although the red car has a fair
lead, it's easy to over take him
after a few corners and bomb it
to the finish. Drift round
corners, use the item boxes
(should be mushrooms) and stick
on the left side of the road to
avoid on coming traffic and you
should get a decent rank no
problem.


-----------
Mission 4-4
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 7
numbered gates in order!

Proceed through the first gate
and drift right and grab an item
box - you should get a mushroom
or three. Use these through gate
two and through the shortcut to
the left of the pyramid, through
the S bend (gate three) and the
gate before the bump (gate
four). On this bumpy straight
collect another three mushrooms
from the item boxes, and begin
using them after the next gate
over the S-bend for the last few
gates.


-----------
Mission 4-5
-----------

Objective - Collect all 15
coins. If you get squished by a
Thwomp, you fail!

GET A STARTING TURBO and race
straight on through the first
line of coins. You'll make it
easily. Now quickly turn around
and start driving down the
second line as the line of
Thwomps have just smashed down.
You should complete it just in
time, with a starred rank.


-----------
Mission 4-6
-----------

Objective - Break all 10 item
boxes while avoiding the Fake
Items!

Taking place on Choco Mountain,
you have to drive through lines
of item boxes; each line has
only one real box, the others
are fake. To spot the difference
remember that on the touch
screen map the real ones are
green and the fake are red, and
that the fake ones don't rotate
in their appearance. Also
remember to use the mushroom you
get from each box to get to the
next line quicker.


-----------
Mission 4-7
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 10
gates!

Set on the table of Waluigi
Pinball, there are ten gates but
you can take in any order. I
find the fastest route is to
drive ahead, then take a hard
right and head round the
flippers for another two, then
continue round this red path to
the top and back down in a
figure of eight pattern. This
should net you a high rank.


-----------
Mission 4-8
-----------

Objective - Perform 9 power-
slide turbo booosts in 1 lap!

Luigi Circuit (GBA) for this
one. As this track thankfully
has plenty of wide U-Turns
(about 9-10) then this shouldn't
be too hard. Remember to avoid
the puddles and not to drift in
that snaky section before the
final two corners. There are no
shortcuts on this track either,
so just stick to the road and
mini-boost away.


----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Collect 50 coins
while avoiding King Boo!

Here you have to collect 50
coins located around the lava
pits around the edges of the
arena. However King Boo will now
and again attack you from behind
and take 10 coins and make all
the others disappear, meaning
you have to chase him down,
nudge in to him and once again
to get the coins back and to
continue your hunt. Drift around
the lava pits when collecting
the coins if you can, and ensure
that when you are collecting
that you get them all as it's a
real pain to go back collect a
coin or two again. It's quite a
tough battle and it's very hard
to get high ranks, but keep at
it.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 4.05. Level 5
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-----------
Mission 5-1
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before the stray Chain Chomp!

You play as Peach in Peach
Gardens. Like the red car
mission the Chain Chomp has a
head start but you can easily
come back. Drift round left
collecting an item box as you
go, which will contain triple
mushrooms. Now instead of
driving round the next two
flower beds, use a mushroom
through them (for the first
boost and drive to the right of
the arrow) and the rest should
be plain sailing. For higher
ranks remember to drift and
mini-boost on corners where you
can.


-----------
Mission 5-2
-----------

Objective - Drive backward and
collect 15 coins! If you hit a
snowman, you
   fail!

Yawn, this is ruthlessly easy.
Remember that you use B to
reverse and the directions too
are reversed, and go round the
central statue collecting the
coins. If you want high ranks,
then just clip the edges of the
coins (so less turning is
involved) and to turn a little
early.


-----------
Mission 5-3
-----------

Objective - Destroy all 5 item
boxes!

There is great method to do this
easily, and with a three star
ranking. Start with a turbo
start and turn left so the boxes
are moving with you on the
right. Now as the boxes come in
from the deep, intercept the
first front box as soon as you
can and then stop dead so the
others run in to you. This may
take a few attempts to do, but
its the simplest way.


-----------
Mission 5-4
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 10
numbered gates in order!

This is essentially a lap of
Bowser Castle 2 (GBA) with gates
throughout. Drive through the
first gate and right round in to
the booster pad, in to gate two.
Drive on to the corner and drift
around through in to gate three
and round the Thomp. Turn and
drift early to the left to catch
the small booster on the far
left, and cross between the pits
through gate four (not touching
the booster jumps) and turn
early to take advantage of the
booster pad on the far right.
Drift round the corner to the
next section. Head straight on
over the jump boosts for the
next gate then stick to the
right for gate six. Drift right
round the corner and stick left
for gate seven, then pull left
for the booster pads to propel
you to the far end. Use the left
jump boost for gate eight, drift
early and through gate nine and
drive straight on to gate ten
(you may have to drive round the
Thomps though).


-----------
Mission 5-5
-----------

Objective - Complete 1 lap in
the opposite direction within
the time limit!

This is a reverse lap of NGC
Mushroom Bridge. Remember you DO
NOT reverse throughout the
track, it's just the track that
is reversed! Anyway you are
forced on the right side due to
the barriers, so wieve through
the traffic and collect the
moving item box for a mushroom.
Through the tunnel grab an item
box for another mushroom; this
can be used for the shortcut as
you exit. Turn left up the hill
and use a mushroom (and hold
right as you do so) and use
another mushroom on the ground.
Proceed through the tunnel and
finish. If you want higher
ranks, remember to drift and
mini-boost the tunnels and
turns.


-----------
Mission 5-6
-----------

Objective - Collect all 18
coins!

Drive onward and collect the two
coins around the coin, then turn
right into a line of three
coins. Drive through this and up
the booster in the centre to
collect one of the coins in the
air. The other side do the same
again; collect the two coins
round the cone, turn right
through the three coins and
collect another coin in the air.
And again when you land, round
the cone and up the centre. As
long as you collect all the
coins first time (especially all
those in the air) you should
attain a high ranking here.


-----------
Mission 5-7
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 8
numbered gates in order!

Once again, you drive up the
reversed DS Pass, but this time
through gates! Drive straight on
and through the first numbered
gate, then drift left through
two and onward through three.
Drive straight on (the snowballs
won't touch you) and over the
hump. Proceed onward through
four, go straight to five (a
snowball pops round this corner
so as long as you aren't too
close you should be OK) and
stick left round this corner to
gate six. Now for the final two,
drive *straight* to them - this
is important as otherwise you'll
get hit by a snowball. For
example just before the last
gate a snowball will bounce
straight for you but it'll
bounce over as you head up the
ramp. You should get a rank if
you follow that walkthrough.


-----------
Mission 5-8
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Mario!

You play as Luigi on Mario
Circuit! You should beat Mario
as long as you drift (and mini-
boost) round corners and use the
items for shortcuts, such as on
the second S-Bend with the
piranhas you can cut out the
last corner using mushrooms or a
star. However after the tight
U-Bend the track is covered with
piranhas so weive round them,
drift the final two corners and
finish. Remember to collect the
item boxes to gain a real
advantage.


----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Hit the Big Bob-Omb
with 3 Bob-Ombs!

Here Big Bob-Omb will summon
item boxes and Bob-Ombs in the
arena, so collect the Item Box
(will contain an Item Box), face
his direction and throw it
directly at him so it explodes
straight away. Avoid the Bob-
Ombs on their own as they will
either detonate on their own or
Big Bob-Omb will collect and
throw it anyway. At the start,
don't turbo-start and drive to
an item box, quickly turn and
throw it at him for an easy hit.
For the second hit, drive up to
him and wait until he summons
more items, then grab an item
box and blow him away. Finally,
he will jump in to the air and
move across the arena (you can
see his location on the touch
screen map). Underneath him he
will drop an item box in the
centre, surrounded by live Bob-
Ombs; collect the item box, and
wait until the Bob-Ombs have
detonated then reverse. He will
drop down, and will be a sitting
duck for the final hit for a
high rank.

 4.06. Level 6
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-----------
Mission 6-1
-----------

Objective - Drive backward
across the spinning bridge! If
you fall, you're out!

Not overly hard this; remember
that B is reverse and that the
directions are reversed. When
going over the bridge, drive
against the movement. Remember
that it does stop and change
direction, so when it does stop,
start driving in the other
direction to counter it. It
should only change direction a
maximum of two times. Once you
reach the other side, you
finish.


-----------
Mission 6-2
-----------

Objective - Get Stars and run
over 15 Rocky Wrenches!

Here you are on the deck of an
airship, with Rocky Wrenches
covering the deck (mole like
creatures) and several item
boxes with Stars. You just have
to be really fast and jolt
around when you see one spring
up to take them out. Try and
collect a star before yours runs
out so you can keep going
constantly. Its tough to get
higher ranks here, but as long
as you are fast, quick and don't
hesitate you should do alright.


-----------
Mission 6-3
-----------

Objective - Collect all 30
coins!

This isn't tough to get high
ranks on. Start with a turbo-
start and drive straight ahead
to take advantage of the
mushroom and shortcut. Drift
round the corner and in to the
next line of coins, then do a
tight drift round the next bend
though the mud lake and navigate
carefully through the field of
brown bumps (don't touch any)
while collecting coins. You can
drift the last corner as well.
As long as you drive carefully
and quickly, you should do
alright here.


-----------
Mission 6-4
-----------

Objective - Destroy all 10 item
boxes!

Here 10 item boxes swarm all
over this battle stage. Here is
a walkthrough to get them
quickly and to attain a high
rank. Start with a turbo boost,
and follow the one ahead and
collect it turns left round the
corner (1). Now turn left and up
the ramp, and collect another as
you go round the corner (2).
Proceed over the bridge straight
ahead collecting another box
from the right (3) to the yellow
island but straight away over
the right bridge to the green
area. Now if you were quick
enough, two boxes will intercept
each other just by this ramp -
one from the right, and if you
stay still the other will run
straight in to you (4 & 5). Now
mount up the ramp, turn right
and over the bridge to the blue
area. Here on the top and middle
levels are three boxes, two of
which should come up and the
other you may have to go down
for (6, 7 & 8). Finally, the
last two boxes are located in
the yellow area in the opposite
corner - one on each the top and
middle levels. You should get a
high rank if you follow this
order!


-----------
Mission 6-5
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 8
numbered gates in order!

Start off with a turbo start and
grab an item box for triple
mushrooms. Drift around the
corner and through the first
gate. After use your first
mushroom to fly off the ramp on
to the clouds behind and through
gate two. Use another mushroom
to fly over the gaps and drift
left. Progress onward and use a
mushroom through the third gate
and over the ramp straight
toward the green mesh bridge and
the forth gate. Drift left, and
drive onward and collect the
item box in the middle and use
it straight away through the
five gate. Drift the corner, and
use a mushroom over the cloud in
the middle and through gate six.
Finally, drift through gate
seven and use your last mushroom
toward gate eight that rests
next to the checkpoint.


-----------
Mission 6-6
-----------

Objective - Perform 14 power-
slide turbo boosts in 1 lap!

Racing as Yoshi on his home
turf, Yoshi Circuit (GameCube)
you have to perform 14
powerslide turbos. Sounds tough
but it is very much possible,
considering the length of the
track. As long as you pull off a
turbo on most of the corners you
should be fine here. You can
pull off at least two turbos
inside the tunnel, and don't
worry about doing many in the
section after that up to the
yellow sign (as it's quite tough
there) and if you run out toward
the end you could always do a
slide turbo on straight. If you
want higher ranks then expect to
semi-snake throughout.


-----------
Mission 6-7
-----------

Objective - Collect all 40
coins!

On a face in Tick-Tock Clock,
you gotta collect 40 coins
whilst avoiding hands that
rotate round. Touching one of
these hands will cause you to
lose coins, so if you hit one
then you are better off
restarting. Plus there are
booster panels, but these are
not worth using. Anyway, begin
with a turbo start and go left
and follow the lines. Basically
just follow the lines up and
down and follow a linear path as
much as possible trying not to
leave any or many coins behind.
Keep any eye out on the bottom
screen for the hands, and do it
sharpish to get a high rank.


-----------
Mission 6-8
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Peach!

This is Peach Circuit, reversed.
Drift the first few corners,
through the dirt path and grab
an item box in the hedge area
after. Use this item (star or
mushrooms) through the flowerbed
left and then navigate the maze
like area - however routes are
cut off but the Chain Chomps are
still there, so make it through
and if you can get an item box
from one of their tails. If you
get them then use it through the
flowerbeds in the next two
sections, and at the end go
clockwise around the island (the
route straight to the finish is
blocked) and then onward and
finish. As usual, drifting and
mini-boosts will net you higher
ranks.


----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Use Mushroom boosts
to hit Chief Chilly and knock
him off the stage
   3 times!

Remember the first boss, where
you had to use triple mushrooms
to knock Big Billy off the edge?
Pretty much same here. After
getting whacked once or twice
quickly grab an item box and ram
him with the mushrooms off the
edge of the arena for the first
hit. Before he comes back grab
another Item Box and lure him to
the edge. You can do this by
stay by edge so he is on your
left or right, then reverse and
mushroom him in to the edge. For
the final hit, he will jump any
boosts toward him so you have to
make sure you are very close to
him when you boost so he has no
time to react. This is very
quickly with no mistakes for a
high ranking!


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 4.07. Level 7
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

What, Level 7!? To unlock this,
get at least a star ranking on
Missions 1-6 and this will
appear.

-----------
Mission 7-1
-----------

Objective - Perform 6 power-
slide turbo boosts in 1 lap!

Although at first impressions
you may think that doing 6
boosts on Rainbow Road is easy,
you have to remember there are
only a few turns on this track
to pull this off. I find that
the turns after the first
boosts, after the loop-de-loop
up to the corkscrew (even the
tight one after the drop) and
two to finish with are the
easiest to do. The fact that its
really fast is somewhat off
putting, but try and play it
safe and you should do fine.


-----------
Mission 7-2
-----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Bowser!

Here you race a lap on Bowser
Castle, but like the other
missions of this type various
parts of the course are blocked
off. Thought out make sure that
you make use of *every* item box
to gain a real advantage and to
get a good rank. Anyway, start
and inside go round left or
right and you should make it
past the Thomps before they
fall. Grab an item box but save
it, and drift round the corners,
up the steps and right. In the
moving floor section you have to
go all the way around and take
the shortcut straight to the
tower so use your item here and
drift up the spiraling ascent.
Out the top to the rotating
bridge drop off on the left (the
end of the bridge is blocked)
and use an item through the
grass and collect another item
box, drift the corner and onward
to the moving platforms. The
rest is as normal, so continue
to use the item boxes to
decrease your time and finish.


-----------
Mission 7-3
-----------

Objective - Complete 2 laps
within the time limit!

Two laps on Tick-Tock clock
within 1:30:00. The course is
pretty much the same as usual
bar that there are now three (!)
swinging pendulums and the hands
and the moving cogs are faster.
For the cogs take them wide due
to their fast nature and
remember they switch direction
for the second lap. And for the
pendulums use an item to speed
through them fast (this means
saving a mushroom from the first
item box). Make sure you take
full advantage of all the items
throughout, to drift and mini-
turbo as much as you can and you
should get a high rank indeed.


-----------
Mission 7-4
-----------

Objective - Use shells to defeat
all 30 Goombas within the time
limit!

Another enemy destroying
mission, however here instead
you have to destroy all the
enemies that you see. This time
it's Goobmas, the weapon of
choice being single or triple
shells. Straight away clear as
many Goobmas away as you can,
then move on down the track for
the next set of Goobmas, destroy
them etc. until they are all
gone. With the shells you can
either fire them or barge into
them (triple shells only)
although the latter is rather
time consuming and as long as
you have a decent shot, firing
them is faster. Any time above
20 seconds should get you a
starred rank, so good luck.


-----------
Mission 7-5
-----------

Objective - Collect all 20
coins!

This takes place on Wario
Stadium; if you hit any fire
then you'll lose about five
coins (this is time consuming so
just restart) and if you miss
any then again it is better off
that you start; it's not that
long a mission anyway. Drift
around the first corner, and the
first coins will be two on the
insides of this coming S-Bend.
Continue round and grab three on
the booster ramp and one in the
ring of fire - so hit the
booster dead on. After the
corner coins are placed before
each booster panel across the
mud lake. Two more booster jumps
with rings of fire await you
after the corner, followed by an
s-bend with the fire lines. Only
two coins here, at the start and
end so just race straight
through it all to the end - note
that usually the end line gets
my kart so if it looks like that
is gonna happen to you then slow
down or something. After ward
take the right set of booster
jumps for the final few coins to
finish.

-----------
Mission 7-6
-----------

Objective - Drive through all 8
numbered gates in order!

What seems like a really easy
mission is in fact a rather
tough nut to crack. There are
eight gates in a circle, which
go 1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8 and 4 - so
basically you do two loops
starting from one to finish.
However you have 10 seconds
which isn't much time at all.
You can do it without drifting
but its tough, but you can do it
very easily in one drift if you
get it bang on right. Turbo
start and hold R and right when
around gate 5 goes out the
picture (or when you hit the
white beam) and just hold that
and you'll drift perfectly
though them all for an easy
three star ranking. Although it
might look like you'll hit a
wall just hold tight and
consider it done. Phew.


-----------
Mission 7-7
-----------

Objective - Drive backward and
collect 12 coins! If you hit a
burner, you fail!

Here you are inside an airship,
navigating a small box maze and
then collecting the final coins
through the burners at the other
end. Use B to reverse and head
to the maze, and turn the corner
and collect the first coin. It's
important to know that you
should take it VERY SLOW and
just tap B now and while turning
using the direction buttons,
otherwise you'll over steer and
hit boxes, really slowing you
down. Anyway after this first
coin really slowly turn the
corner (U-Bend) and race down to
the end to the next one. Again,
very slowly turn for the third
coin, and weive in and out the
boxes for the next coins. Again
turn and do the same and out,
and head left and round between
the boxes to the burners. It's a
good idea to wait for either
burner to be well away from the
coins before you go through -
ie. the first burner to be far
right, the second to be fair
left. Finish by collecting the
beyond coin.

-----------
Mission 7-8
-----------

Objective - Break all 10 item
boxes while avoiding the Fake
Items!

Heh, and you thought you had
gotten away from this course,
right? Drift left and then turn
right avoiding the banana skins
and grab the right box (1).
Drift left then use the
mushroom, and grab the left box
(2). Quickly use it and navigate
through the bananas situated at
the corner, then grab the right
(3) then left (4) boxes,
followed by bananas skins. Use
the mushrooms down on to the
walkway below and collect the
left box (5) and round the
corner past yet more banana
skins. Box (6) is as you enter
the building.

Now two choices; easy or hard?
Easy is going right, then sharp
left, over the gap next to the
wooden beam and then turning out
of your way left for the next
box. Or you can turn left as you
enter the building, stick to the
side to avoid the bananas, jump
the gap left and get the box in
a much faster time. While the
latter is harder to pull off,
it's a must do if you want
higher ranks (7).

Either way after grabbing that
box, use the mushroom to the
right and then drift left round
the wall so you avoid the
blockade of fake item boxes, and
turn early and close to the beam
so you grab the next box (8).
Exit the building and drift
left, using the mushroom you
just received on this straight.
Grab the right box (9), drift
left then mushroom it straight
to the last box (10) to finish.

----------
Boss Stage
----------

Objective - Reach the finish
before Wiggler!

Despite this being the final
boss and all, I find this quite
fun. Mainly because Wiggler is
really awesome and he just
smashes his way through traffic.
Anyway, you race Wiggler on
Mushroom Bridge (NGC) with three
laps to beat him. You have item
boxes to help you that move
along the road, each containing
a star. The star is useful as it
allows you to take advantage of
the shortcut out o f the first
tunnel, straight on, over and
right to the next tunnel), it
allows you to plough through the
traffic and best of all to get
mushrooms from the trucks.

The plan is that you will always
have an item on you. So grab an
item box and use the star, and
when you see a truck (and only
trucks, no cars or coaches)
smash in to it to get a mushroom
and use this when you are
finished. Keep racing until you
find another item box, use the
star, rinse and repeat, and keep
doing this until the end. It's
VERY important to get every box,
even if it means missing out on
that shortcut as that gives you
a huge advantage. It should be
really easy to beat this guy;
the real challenge comes from
getting the very high ranks,
attainable from drifting and
mini- boosting / snaking when
you can. And when you've done
this, you are free of the
missions! Woo-hoo!

          5. CHECKLIST
        ----------------
================================

This is a checklist for you to
see how far you are progressing
in the game. This is for your
grand prix progress, the
missions, staff ghosts, and how
much you've unlocked besides
other things. Best results are
to copy this into a text editor
like Word so you can edit it and
make it more printable.

       ------------------
         6. UNLOCKABLES
       ------------------
================================

-------------------------------
Unlockable Characters and Karts
-------------------------------

As with Double Dash!! you can
unlock extra characters and
karts by progressing in the
Grand Prix mode.

Dry Bones - Get Gold on all
Nitro Cups in 50CC mode Daisy -
Get Gold on all Retro Cups in
50CC mode

3rd Kart for all characters -
Get Gold on all Nitro Cups in
100CC mode Waluigi - Get Gold on
all Retro Cups in 100CC mode

7 Karts for all characters - Get
Gold on all Nitro Cups in 150CC
mode R.O.B. - Get Gold on all
Retro Cups in 150 CC mode

Choose any kart for any
character - Get Gold on all
150CC Mirror Cups


-----------------
150CC Mirror Mode
-----------------

Getting gold on the first three
Grand Prix Modes (50CC, 100CC
and 150CC) will unlock this
mode. Basically all the tracks
are reversed, but as you've
played each track by at least
three times by now you should be
able to tackle these with
relative ease.


--------------------------------
Alternative Title and Ending
Screens
--------------------------------

Achieve a gold in every cup for
the title and ending screens to
change for good. This includes
the dreaded 150CC Mirror mode as
well.


-----------------
Starred Nicknames
-----------------

Complete all the cups within all
CC classes with a starred rank
to receive a starred nickname.
So complete them all with at
least one star to get a one star
nickname, two for two and three
for three. To see what you have,
check the Records section of the
Main Menu and you'll see it on
the top screen. This is also
shown to you opponents online,
putting a bit of fear in to
them. To see what this looks
like, then unlock a staff ghost
and race them (see below). Looks
quite cool, eh? For tips on how
to get stars on a cup in the
Grand Prix mode, check the Grand
Prix section in Game Modes
(section 4).


-----------------------
Level 7 in Mission Mode
-----------------------

To unlock Level 7 in the Mission
Mode, get an overall 1 star
ranking on all the missions.


------------
Staff Ghosts
------------

Another thing to beat in Mario
Kart DS are Staff Ghosts. Seen
that Time Trial section? Paid
much attention to it so far?
Thought not. However you will
do, as Staff Ghosts are awesome
times set by those who made the
game. First you have to unlock
them, then you can race against
them to see if you can beat
them.

To unlock a staff ghost, get
within about 5-10 of their time
(varies according the course)
and then change course or
something so you see the Ghost
selection screen. If it's
unlocked then you can select to
race against it. And what do you
get if you beat them? Nothing,
apart from the knowledge that
you're quite a good player, plus
you would have picked up a few
new tricks and shortcuts on some
of the courses. Handy for
online, eh?

            7. FAQ'S
          ------------
================================

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Q. What is the best character
combination?

A. It all depends on your style
of play - check the Characters
and Karts
   section at the bottom for a
   list of the best karts
   according to the stats you
   want to specialise in.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Q. What kart and character do
you race as?

A. I race with Yoshi & Egg 1, as
it's great for snaking and has a
decent
   enough speed to boot.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Q. I cannot snake, help!

A. Read the Controls and
Techniques section to find out
how to do this. If you
   are having trouble, then
   choose Dry Bones with the Dry
   Bomber; due to the high drift
   and handling stats, it's very
   easy to pull off snaking.
   Practice on 50CC until you
   get it. Once you have
   mastered that kart, try
   moving on to Yoshi & Egg 1;
   while the handling is harder,
   the speed is higher and so
   overall is a better choice.
   However it is worth
   practicing with the Dry
   Bomber first.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Q. I cannot connect to the
Nintendo WiFi Connection, help!

A. I'm not that much of a
computer buff to know enough
about this, but go to
   the GameFAQs Mario Kart DS
   message boards and ask there.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Q. I heard that you can play as
Shyguy in the game; how?

A. This is true! However you
have to play a single cart game
with other DS
   owners, and you'll play as
   Shyguy (who is classed as a
   Light character). You cannot
   play as him, or against him,
   in Single Player mind.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Q. Can I have your friend code?

A. Sure, just give me an email.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Any other questions, feel free
to give me an email.
