BE SURE TO READ THIS FIRST PART!
You can read this faq as long as
you don't change ANY part of it
(including this small
introduction). Also, you can
print it but only for use at
your home, you may NEVER sell
this stuff or else you will make
me really mad and maybe I won't
work anymore! Finally, if you
want to use this faq on your
site (or use any part of it for
other things, like writing your
own faq or something) you have
to mail me and ask me for it, I
will almost surely grant it to

1~. Introduction

This title marks the first time
that Sonic and Mario, two old
rivals, can confront each other
in the field. However, be aware
that all characters are slightly
less powerful than usual. Sonic,
for example, is still a fast
runner, but he won't be you
won't see him magically winning
all the races, and Mario doesn't
perform miraculous jumps.
Instead, they're given stats
based on their proficiency in
certain areas, which is more
than fair. Now, Mario and Sonic
come with tons of different
comrades, each with unique
stats, and you'll be using them
all to participate in some kind
of Olympic Games, where all the
events are played via mini-
games. Not all Olympic
modalities are depicted in this
game, but the ones here
available all play in an unique
way, and even if the gameplay
ends up being rather predictable
and possibly gets old after a
while, that is where Wi-fi
gameplay ends up being
important, as it allows you to
compare your own records with
those of other players from all
over the world, always giving
you new records to outdo. This
guide tries to cover as much of
the game as possible, and if
you're having any problems with
any part of the game, be sure to
read the proper section of the
guide. I'm not able to give you
magical solutions, but at least
I'll try to give you deep hints
on how to beat particular events
or achieve certain prizes.



2~. Main Menu

After popping the game into your
console, you can press start to
actually begin all the
competition. If you've already
created your own game, you can
simply load its slot, but by
selecting an empty slot you'll
be able to input your own name
and choose a flag for your slot.
These choices aren't that
important offline, but be aware
that they play a more important
role online (if you later feel
like changing them, you can do
so by acessing the "Options"
menu, as stated later in this
guide). Once you've picked your
main slot, you'll finally see
the main menu, filled with tons
of different options, as
described below.



2.1~. Single Player

There's not much I can tell you
about this option... obviously
available in the main menu, this
is the one you should pick if
you want to spend some time
playing this game by yourself.
The options that you're allowed
to pick are described next.



2.1.1~. Single Match

By picking this option, you're
allowed to select a single event
(see the listing later in this
guide) and one character, and
you're allowed to change some of
its options by pressing "Set
Rules" before the actual event.
Obviously, you should try to win
that event with the character
you've chosen, and if you manage
to do it you'll unlock a medal.
Being the third best awards a
bronze medal, the second best is
given a silver medal and the top
performer is graciously offered
a gold medal, just like in the
real Olympic Games. Be aware
that all those medals are stored
in the very same place, i.e. you
don't have to collect them all,
and once a character gets a gold
medal for a specific event there
is no need to replay it in order
to get the other two medals, as
they're just unnecessary by
then.



2.1.2~. Circuit

Possibly one of the biggest
single options that this game
has to offer, this is the mode
that you'll have to play if you
want to unlock more events than
the ones acessible initially.
The game has 16 different
circuits to enjoy, plus one that
allows you to compose your very
own circuit. The enemies you
fight in each circuit are
random, and if you just don't
like what you're seeing (i.e.
they are too strong for you),
you can simply exit that option
- by returning there later on,
you'll be facing different
characters. Also, I must give
you an important note concerning
these circuits - even though you
must qualify in the first
position to earn that circuits'
trophy, if you're simply wanting
to unlock the next circuit (or
new events), you just need to
complete it in the first three
positions, a task which is
easier to perform. Finally,
you're usually allowed to use a
coin before each event. Doing so
basically doubles the points
that you earn with that event,
and I strongly suggest you use
it only when you're sure that
you can get the very first
position for that event, as
doing so will give you an
important 20 points, which may
be the difference between
qualifying in the first or
second spots for a particular
circuit. If you have this is
mind, you will have an easier
time with all circuits, just be
sure to bet on events that
you're sure that you can win.
Next, a quick reference to all
the 17 (actually, 16 + 1)
circuits this game has to
offer...



2.1.2.1~. Beginner's Class -
      Mercury Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m

----- Long Jump

----- Hammer Throw

In order to face this first
circuit, I suggest you pick a
Speed Type character, possibly
"Shadow", since he is not only a
fast runner but also has some
power and fair skill.



2.1.2.2~. Beginner's Class -
      Venus Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m Freestyle

----- Shooting

----- Table Tennis

Here, you may want to pick a
character that has good skill
and speed, such as "Peach".



2.1.2.3~. Beginner's Class -
      Jupiter Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Cycling

----- Fencing

----- 400m

Power and speed are clear
requisites for facing this
circuit, which turn both "Sonic"
and "Shadow" into good options.



2.1.2.4~. Beginner's Class -
      Saturn Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Trampoline

----- Archery

----- Javelin Throw

Due to its configuration, your
best choice here is possibly one
of the all-around characters.
I'm not mentioning any names,
since they're all very close to
each other, and you're free to
pick the one you like the most.
Personally, I picked "Mario"
just for fun, but there may be
other options, ones that better
fit your personal taste.



2.1.2.5~. Beginner's Class -
      Moonlight Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 400m Hurdles

----- Triple Jump

----- Dream Table Tennis

For the last circuit of this
first class, I suggest you pick
an all-around character that has
high Speed and Stamina. "Amy",
for example, is a good option.



2.1.2.6~. Advanced Class -
      Stardust Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m

----- Long Jump

----- Hammer Throw

----- Vault

Due to her high speed and skill,
"Peach" is probably one of the
best characters that you can
pick for this circuit.



2.1.2.7~. Advanced Class -
      Planet Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m Freestyle

----- Shooting

----- Table Tennis

----- Dream Basketball

As before, "Peach" is a good
option for this one, but "Wario"
may also end up being a good
choice.



2.1.2.8~. Advanced Class - Comet
      Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Cycling

----- Fencing

----- 400m

----- Dream Race

With so many speed-related
events, you could feel like
picking one of those speedy
characters, but be aware they
also tend to have low stamina,
which is a problem. So, one of
your best options ends up being
"Knuckles", a character who has
fair speed and good stamina.



2.1.2.9~. Advanced Class -
      Satellite Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Trampoline

----- Archery

----- Javelin Throw

----- 10m Platform

Someone with high skill and some
power is a good option here,
someone just like "Waluigi".



2.1.2.10~. Advanced Class -
      Sunlight Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 400m Hurdles

----- Triple Jump

----- Dream Table Tennis

----- Dream Fencing

An all-around character, such as
"Mario", ends up being one of
the best options for this
circuit.



2.1.2.11~. Master's Class -
      Meteorite Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m

----- Long Jump

----- Hammer Throw

----- Vault

----- Dream Canoe

"Mario", once more, is a good
option, but so is "Knuckles".



2.1.2.12~. Master's Class -
      Supernova Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 100m Freestyle

----- Shooting

----- Table Tennis

----- Dream Basketball

----- Dream Boxing

Since you won't be needing much
stamina, "Shadow" is a good
option for this circuit. "Wario"
also works just fine.



2.1.2.13~. Master's Class -
      Cosmos Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- cycling

----- Fencing

----- 400m

----- Dream Race

----- Dream Shooting

Speed, stamina and (some) power
play an important role here, and
"Blaze" ends up being a good
option.



2.1.2.14~. Master's Class -
      Galaxy Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Trampoline

----- Archery

----- Javelin Throw

----- 10m Platform

----- Dream Long Jump

Some with high skill and some
power is a good option here,
someone like "Waluigi".



2.1.2.15~. Master's Class -
      Universal Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- 400m Hurdles

----- Triple Jump

----- Archery

----- Dream Table Tennis

----- Dream Fencing

"Mario", "Blaze" or "Sonic" are
good options.



2.1.2.16~. Master's Class - Big
      Bang Circuit

This Circuit is composed by the
following events:

----- Dream Boxing

----- Dream Canoe

----- Dream Basketball

----- Dream Long Jump

----- Dream Race

Here, it is not a matter of who
you pick, but how you play.
Going for an all-around
character may be a good idea,
but it is really up to your
personal preferences, since
you'll always have some
strenghts and weaknesses in the
events stated above. "Luigi" did
it for me, after a couple tries,
but you should be very careful
with your opponents, since they
are a lot stronger than in the
past events. If you bet on an
event which you're sure that you
can win, you'll have an easier
time with all the others, and
that's something to be very
careful about, as it may take
you a while to gain the skill
necessary to successfully
complete this unusual circuit.



2.1.2.17~. Free

Unlike what happens in the other
16 circuits, which have all
their events set in stone, here
it is up to you to you pick what
you want to play. You can either
let the console assign random
ones or pick up to five by
yourself, it's rather simple,
and if you pick a wrong option
you can always go back by
pressing "B" - something that is
useful either if you dislike
what the console picked or if
you want to correct some of the
previous choices you made. Even
though there's not really a
purpose behind this mode, it is
a good way to test particular
characters against a certain
circuit, without having to try
tons of different events one by
one.



2.1.3~. Mission

By selecting this option, you'll
be allowed to play five missions
unique to each character. Once
one of your characters completes
all five, he (or she) will
receive a unique emblem, symbol
of his achievement, and that is
basically it. For more
information on what you have to
do in each mission, along with
basic strategies for all of
those, check the "Characters"
section of this very same guide.



2.2~. Versus Play

When you select this option,
your console will instantly try
to connect to other consoles
that have the game, in order to
play against them, but by
selecting "Create Group" you
will also be able to play
against people who don't have
this game, via Download Play. If
you're playing against other
folks who have the game, you'll
be able to pick any events (or
circuits) that the host has
unlocked, but when playing
against folks who don't have the
game you can only access six
different events - 100m, Long
Jump, Trampoline, Archery, Dream
Basketball and Dream Canoe.
Next, you can all pick an unique
character (no, you can't have
multiple people picking "Sonic",
"Mario" or anyone else) and, if
less than four people are
playing, the console assigns the
two other slots to opponents
controlled by the CPU. That's as
far as it goes, but at least
they're not making you pay for
multiple carts in order to have
some quick fun with your
friends.



2.3~. Records

Picking this option just leads
to its submenu, where you can
see all the records that your
characters have set.



2.3.1~. Records

Just as stated above, by picking
this option you're taken to a
place where, given a specific
event, you're allowed to see all
the records that people using
your cart have set, along with
the character they've chosen
back when they set that
particular record.



2.3.2~. Nintendo WFC Rankings

Provided you have access to a
wireless connection to the
internet, you can use this
option to compare your own
records against other players
from all over the world, just
enter this mode and press start
to update all your records. Be
aware that there is no real way
to play online against other
fellows who have the game, and
this is what better resembles
such option.



2.3.3~. Collection

By selecting this option, you
can access a place where you'll
see the many in-game awards that
this game has to offer, and
check which ones you've already
collected.



2.3.3.1~. Medals

Here you can see all medals that
your characters currently have.
Be aware that medals are unique
to each character, and you can
unlock new ones by achieving
victories (first, second or
third places) in the "Single
Match" mode. Here are the medals
that each of your characters can
get:.

each of those by themselves, in
the "Single Match" mode.

2.3.4~. Nintendo WFC Settings

Useful only if you've never
played any Wi-fi enabled titles,
or if you need to change
something, this option allows
you to configure your Wi-fi
settings, which are independent
from the game you're playing,
and are set in your console
firmware. If you're having
trouble with this part of your
configuration, be sure to check
Nintendo's Wi-fi website, which
is usually available at
http://www.nintendowifi.com/ .



2.4~. Gallery

Possibly an option that may be
unappeling to some players, you
can here play some mini-games
which, upon completion, unveil
some interesting facts on the
Olympic Games and subjects
related to them, trivia which is
also mentioned in this guide.
Also, there are more than five
different mini-games, with
increasing difficulty modes, and
that is basically it, as you'll
be able to read below.



2.4.1~. Olympic Trivia

In this mini-game, you will see
a sequence in the upper screen,
and you'll have to follow that
very same sequence in the lower
screen, by quickly tapping the
same jewels which were activated
in the upper screen. As you
advanced in levels, you'll see
more jewels and the sequences
will become more complex, but
you should be aware that only
have to score five points in
each level to advance to the
next one. Complete all five
different levels in order to
unlock all the information and
two CDs (one for Sonic team and
one for the Mario team), which
you can play in the Jukebox.
Now, some trivia connected to
this minigame:


Q: Which colors are used for the
five rings of the Olympic
symbol?

A: In order, they are blue,
yellow, black, red, and green.
At least one of
   these five colors is used in
   every national flag.


Q: How do they determine
countries and locations where
the Olympic Games
   will be held?

A: The Host City for each
Olympic Games is chosen from
among the candidate
   cities by a vote of the
   International Olympic
   Committee.


Q: Which continent hasn't been
host to the modern Olympic
Games?

A: The modern Olympic Games
haven't been held in Africa.


Q: How is the Olympic flame lit?

A: The Olympic flame is lit by

Greece.


Q: Which team marches last in
the Opening Ceremony?

A: The team representing the
host country marches last.


That's all for this section....



2.4.2~. Modern Olympic Games

In this mini-game, you have to
throw the green shell to the
upper screen, so that it hits as
many opponents as possible. Be
aware of Boos (they can only be
hit when they're fully visible)
and Bob-ombs (they explode on
impact, destroying your shell),
but everyone else is just safe
to hit at all times. As you
advance in levels, tougher
enemies will appear, but you
only have to score 10 points in
order to unlock the next level.
Complete all five different
levels in order to unlock all
the information and two CDs (one
for Sonic team and one for the
Mario team), which you can play
in the Jukebox. Now, some trivia
connected to this minigame:


Q: Where were the Games of the
first Olympiad held?

A: They were held in Athens,
Greece.


Q: When was the first Olympic
torch relay?

A: The torch relay was
introduced in the 1936 Berlin
Olympic Games.


Q: Which Olympic Games were the
first to be broadcast on TV?

swimming events at the Olympic
Games?

A: Yes. The first Olympic
swimming contests, at the 1896

   were held in the Bay of Zea.


That's all for this section....



2.4.3~. Beijing 2008

Here, instead of facing a single
mini-game, you will be finding
three different ones, all based
on cards. The first (and the
forth) one makes you match the
card seen in the upper screen
with one from a group seen in
the lower screen. Later, the
game becomes harder, and you'll
have less time to find the right
one. The second (and the fifth)
one makes you match pairs from
the cards displayed on the
field. There is no easy way out
of that one, and you'll be
probably relying on luck and
your own memory. The third game
simply makes you keep track of a
certain card, and then moves
them all across the board. In
the end, you must point to the
right card. Be aware that the
number of points required for
each mini-game (and level)
deeply varies, and you must
complete all five different
games in order to unlock all the
information and two CDs (one for
Sonic team and one for the Mario
team), which you can play in the
Jukebox. Now, some trivia
connected to this minigame:


Q: What is the nickname of the
official mascots of the Beijing
2008
   Olympic Games?

A: "Fuwa," which translates to
"good luck dolls." They carry a
message of
   friendship and peace and
   their colors are the same as
   those used in the Olympic
   Rings.


Q: What is the meaning of the
combined names of the five
mascots?

A: If you put together the names
of the five mascots, Beibei,
Jingjing,
   Huanhuan, Yingying, and Nini,
   you will get: "Beijing
   huanying ni." This means
   "Welcome to Beijing" in
   Chinese.


Q: What are the missing words in
the Beijing 2008 slogan below?
"One ???,
   One ???"

A: The slogan is: "One World,
One Dream".


Q: What time and date will the
Opening Ceremony for the Beijing
2008
   Olympic Games begin?

A: It will begin at 8:08:08 pm,
August 8, 2008. (Eight is a
lucky number
   in China, symbolizing growth
   and development.)


Q: How much distance will the
Beijing 2008 Olympic Torch Relay
cover?

A: The torch relay will last 130
miles and travel 85,128 miles
(137,000km)
   from Olympia to Beijing. It
   will travel the longest
   distance and include the
   largest number of people of
   any torch relay so far.


That's all for this section....



2.4.4~. Ancient Olympic Games

In this mini-game, you have to
control a blimp, and use it to
gather as many golden rings as
possible. You can use your
control pad to move it left,
right and down, but in case you
want to take your blimp up you
will have to blow some air onto
the microphone. Ten points,
which you get by collecting
rings, are enough to complete
each level. Complete all five
different levels in order to
unlock all the information and
two CDs (one for Sonic team and
one for the Mario team), which
you can play in the Jukebox.
Now, some trivia connected to
this minigame:


Q: Why are the Olympic Games
held every four years?

A: Because the ancient Olympic
Games that took place in
Olympia, Greece
   were held every four years.


Q: Was there only one event in
the ancient Olympic Games in 776
B.C.?

A: Yes. It was a running event,
called the stadion or stade.
Athletes ran
   the length of the stadium, a
   distance of about 219 yards
   (200 meters).


Q: Were there any team sports in
the ancient Olympic Games?

A: Team sports were not included
in the ancient Olympic Games.


Q: Is it true that ancient
Olympic Games included chariot
races?

A: Yes. A competition for a
four-horse chariot race, a
tethrippon, was
   introduced in 680 B.C. Two
   more chariot races were added
   later on.


Q: What was the "pankration"
event?

A: An event in the ancient
Olympic Games, the "pankration"
event was a
   combination of wrestling and
   boxing. The match continued
   until one of the athletes
   surrendered.


That's all for this section....



2.4.5~. About Athletes

In this mini-game, you have to
split the enemies that come in
the conveyor belt to the proper
box. Simply use your stylus to
grab each of the enemies and
drag them to the proper place.
As you advance to the higher
levels, more boxes will appear
and the conveyor belt will start
moving faster, but 15 points are
usually enough to complete each
level. Complete all five
different levels in order to
unlock all the information and
two CDs (one for Sonic team and
one for the Mario team), which
you can play in the Jukebox.
Now, some trivia connected to
this minigame:


Q: What is the Athletes' Village
like?

A: The athletes live in the
Athletes' Village during the
Games, and it has
   training fields and
   cafeterias. There are even
   banks, post offices,
   cleaners, and souvenir shops.


Q: When did female athletes
first participate in the Olympic
Games?

A: Their participation started
from the second Olympic Games
held in Paris
   in 1900.


Q: Who recites the Olympic oath
in the opening ceremony?

A: An athlete from the nation
that hosts the Olympic Games
gives the oath,
   on behalf of the
   participating athletes from
   every country.


Q: A perfect performance only
got a 1.00 score!?

A: In the Montreal 1976 Olympic
Games, Nadia Comaneci, a
Romanian gymnast,
   performed a perfect routine
   for the first time on the
   uneven bars. The scoreboards
   were not equipped to display
   scores of 10.0, so the
   routine was reported on the
   boards as 1.00 instead.


Q: How old was the youngest
person to place in the top 3 at
the Olympic
   Games?

A: Greek athlete Dimitrios
Loundras was 10 and 218 days old
when he came
   in 3rd in the parallel bars
   gymnastics team event at the
   1896 Olympic Games.


That's all for this section....



2.4.6~. Jukebox

In this Jukebox you're allowed
to listen to some classical
songs from the Sonic and Mario
series. At first, you'll be
stuck with the gallery's theme
song, from this very same game,
which has an image of the
Parthenon, but as you complete
the mini-games mentioned above
you will unlock new CDs to
listen to, each containing a
different theme song from the
Mario and Sonic series. Apart
from that, there's not much else
to do here. Next, is a reference
to all the songs that you can
unlock:


Mario songs (left side of the
screen)

--- Tetris DS Mario Puzzle Mix

--- Super Mario 64 DS Mini-Games
    Coincentration

--- Tetris DS Bowser Battle

--- Super Mario 64 DS Mini-Games
    Bounce and Pounce

--- Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
    Mario Bros. Circuits


Sonic songs (right side of the
screen)

--- SONIC THE HEDGEHOG Green
    Hill Zone

--- SONIC THE HEDGEHOG Star
    Light Zone

--- SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 2 Emerald
    Hill Zone

--- SONIC RUSH Right There, Ride
    On

--- SONIC RUSH ADVENTURE New
    Venture


That's all for this section....



2.5~. Options (Audio Settings,
  User Settings and Microphone
  Test)

Ah... the classical "Options"
mode. I really hope you know
what this one is all about, or
else maybe you shouldn't be
playing this title. As always,
this option enables you to tune
up some of the gameplay areas,
such as its sound, and it isn't
really important. More often
than not, it is the kind of
thing you'll always try to
ignore.

"Audio Settings" enables you to
change the volume of certain in-
game sounds, such as the music,
sound effects and voices.

"User Settings" makes it
possible for you to change the
name associated to your profile,
the country flag associated to
your profile, apart from making
it possible for you to set an
emblem (from your connection)
that becomes associated with
your player account.

"Microphone Test" is a good
option to use, if you're trying
to figure out the volume of the
sound you must produce in order
for the game to correctly
understand it. There's no way to
configure it, at least in this
game, and therefore you may want
to try this option if you're
having trouble with any of the
events that require you to
produce some sort of sound.



3~. Characters (and "Mission"
mode mini-walkthrough)

Next, there is a description of
all characters selectable in
this game, alongside with some
basic information on them and a
mini-walkthrough for their five
missions (and one extra, which
is only available once you beat
the other five), available in
"Mission" mode. Usually, I'll be
following this setup:

--- STATS ----
Speed - (his speed stat)
Power - (his power stat)
Skill - (his skill stat)
Stamina - (his stamina stat)

CHARACTER TYPE - (the type of
character, Power/All-
Around/Speed/Skill)

FIRST APPEARANCE - (the
name/date of the game where they
first appeared)

MISSION EVENT - (name here)

OBJECTIVE - (the objective you
must perform)

TIPS - (some tips for this
mission)


MISSION EVENT - (name here)

(...) All the way up to the last
mission for each character, and
then:


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? (some
information on when you should
use this
      particular character, for
      those of you who
  have trouble reading charts)

Also, be aware that the enemies
that you confront in each event
are usually random, and you may
want to get unskilled ones for
events that require proficiency
on a particular area. If you
just can't beat your opponents,
keep on quitting and retrying
this mode until you get some
that are more unskilled than
your current setup. Finally, a
mission will only be available
if you've already unlocked that
particular event, which you can
do by playing the "Circuit" mode
up to its end, unlocking tons of
new events on your way there.
Also, the sixth mission for each
character only becomes available
when you complete the first
five, in no particular order.



3.1~. Knuckles

--- STATS ----
Speed - [][][]
Power - [][][][]
Skill - [][
Stamina - [][][][

CHARACTER TYPE - Power Type

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Sonic the
Hedgehog 3", 1994


MISSION EVENT - Hammer Throw

OBJECTIVE - "Throw 3 times,
increasing your distance each
time!"

TIPS - This may sound like a
tough objective, but once you
figure the
 trick it is an easy one. If you
 keep spinning "Knuckles" after
 the 3-second countdown expires,
 he will perform a slightly weak
 throw, which will be easy to
 outdo. On your second throw,
 repeat it but spin your
 character faster than before.
 For the last attempt, simply
 throw the hammer as you'd
 usually do, to perform a good
 record and finish this
 objective once and for all.


MISSION EVENT - 400m

OBJECTIVE - "Finish in 2nd
place!"

TIPS - Perform this event as
you'd normally do, but keep
track of your
 current position by looking at
 the lower left side of the
 console's top screen. If, when
 you see the "Final Sprint"
 warning, are in first place,
 you may want to settle down and
 let the second opponent
 magically outperform your
 character, before starting to
 run at cruiser speed. Also,
 this is the kind of event which
 you may want to get specific
 opponents on, since outdoing
 characters who have a Speed
 Type may be hard to complete.


MISSION EVENT - 10m Platform

OBJECTIVE - "Perform GREAT or
PERFECT in all aspects of the
event!"

TIPS - Try to keep the initial
bar (i.e. the one that pops up
when you
 start your jump) as high as
 possible, before letting "A"
 go. Then, on the jump itself,
 input all commands, there's no
 easy way out of that one,
 simply try to input them as
 quickly as possible and without
 commiting any mistakes.
 Finally, after the small
 cutscene, press "A" only when
 Knuckles is looking down, and
 try to aim at an angle of
 around 0º from the vertical
 line of your jump.


MISSION EVENT - Table Tennis

OBJECTIVE - "Perform 5
successful smashes and win!"

TIPS - Even though it is
possible to accomplish this
objective against any
 enemy, I suggest you try doing
 it with someone who is weak at
 this event, such as Bowser. The
 objective is not very clear,
 but what they are asking you to
 do is score at least five
 points by using smashes i.e.
 those moves in which the ball
 leaves a red (or yellow) tail
 behind it, as your final move.
 It is hard to master, but if
 you're facing a weak opponent
 it becomes easier to do.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Basketball

OBJECTIVE - "Perform 1 combo
within 30 seconds!"

TIPS - Doing a combo is easy,
you just need to throw the ball
in a way it
 passes across two baskets, and
 you can easily do it by
 throwing a ball to the top (or
 middle) baskets as soon as the
 level begins. If you fail it by
 then, you should do it when two
 baskets cross each other's
 path, but be aware they move at
 different speeds.


FINAL MISSION - Dream Boxing

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Wario when
he's in top condition!"

TIPS - By "top condition", they
mean that his attacks are
stronger and
 that he will block most of your
 special attacks. Defend as much
 as necessary, dodge to the left
 and right (followed by quick
 punches) and use your specials
 only when his gloves are
 sparkly - he will counter your
 special, but if you press "A"
 as quickly as possible your
 attack will outdo his, and he
 will suffer all the damage of
 your strike, which is a good
 way to defeat him here.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? His
high power, good stamina and
fair speed make
      him great for circuits
      that rely on throwing
      javelins/hammers,
      alongside with running
      events that rely on
      stamina, instead of high
      speed.



3.2~. Bowser

--- STATS ----
Speed - []
Power - [][][][][]
Skill - [][
Stamina - [][][][][

CHARACTER TYPE - Power Type

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Super Mario
Bros.", 1985


MISSION EVENT - Fencing

OBJECTIVE - "Parry 5 of your
opponent's attacks, and win!"

TIPS - Simple, to parry you just
have to do an upward motion with
your
 stylus - focus mostly on that
 aspect of this level and you'll
 do just fine, it is harder to
 parry than it is to actually
 defeat your enemy.


MISSION EVENT - Hammer Throw

OBJECTIVE - "Throw 3 times in a
row for a total of at least
220m!"

TIPS - Do the best you can for
the three throws, complete with
shouting
 when you see the "!" symbol (it
 appears just after throwing the
hammer), and that will be fine.


MISSION EVENT - 400m

OBJECTIVE - "Overcome a 1-second
handicap to win!"

TIPS - Follow your usual
strategy, along with a good
starting dash.


MISSION EVENT - Archery

OBJECTIVE - "Get 10 points 3
times in a row!"

TIPS - There's no wind, aim at
the center of the bullseye and
you'll be
 easily accomplishing this one.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Table
Tennis

OBJECTIVE - "Earn at least 20
points in a single rally!"

TIPS - Keep on trading the ball
back and forth until the counter
is over
 20, use your special attack
 (press X when the ball is in
 your side of the field) and, if
 successful, it will all be
 over.


FINAL MISSION - Dream Fencing

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Vector when
he's in top condition!"

TIPS - Strike as much as
possible, try to parry a few
attacks, use your
 special attack as soon as you
 get one (and, obviously, you
 may want to be just next to
 your opponent) and you won't
 have much trouble.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? For
events (or circuits) which
require a lot of
      power, such as throwing
      javelins and hammers, or
          for boxing.



3.3~. Vector

--- STATS ----
Speed - [][
Power - [][][][][
Skill - [][
Stamina - [][][][][

CHARACTER TYPE - Power Type

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Knuckles'
Chaotix", 1995


MISSION EVENT - 100m Freestyle

OBJECTIVE - "Finish in 2nd
place, within 50 seconds!"

TIPS - Perform as you'd normally
do, but always keep track of
your current
 position by looking at the
 lower left corner of the
 console's upper screen. If, at
 the time you're reaching the
 goal, you're in first place,
 keep on swimming BUT slower, so
 that you end up being second at
 the end.


MISSION EVENT - Hammer Throw

OBJECTIVE - "Perform a GREAT
throw!"

TIPS - Spin as fast as you can,
throw as soon as the countdown
gets all
 the way down to 1 and be sure
 to shout when you see the "!"
 prompt, which appear as soon as
 you throw the hammer. Doing all
 this will probably get you the
 requirement you're asked for.


MISSION EVENT - Trampoline

OBJECTIVE - "Earn GOOD ratings 8
times in your performance!"

TIPS - Jump as high as possible,
complete all the inputs that you
see in
 your screen and you'll get this
 one.


MISSION EVENT - Fencing

OBJECTIVE - "Overcome a 5-point
handicap and win!"

TIPS - try to parry a few
attacks, strike as much as you
can and you'll
 probably win. Be sure to
 remember that your opponent is
 randomly chosen, and if you
 just can't do it, keep on
 heading out until you find an
 opponent that better fits your
 needs.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Canoe

OBJECTIVE - "Use items on all
your opponents."

TIPS - It's all a matter of
timing. Try to get the best
items as quickly
 as possible (red, blue or green
 shells are great) and aim them
 at your opponents quickly. If
 you just can't do it in time,
 keep on trying and, sooner or
 later, I'm sure you'll be able
 to complete this mission.


FINAL MISSION - Dream Table
Tennis

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Bowser when
he's in top condition!"

TIPS - This isn't very hard, but
you may want to use your own
Special Move
 to counter the one of your
 opponent, in an attempt to have
 an easier time with it.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? For
events that require throwing
something, such
      as javelins/hammers, or
      for boxing matches.
      Circuits with lots of
      events that require power
   and stamina will do, too.



3.4~. Wario

--- STATS ----
Speed - [][]
Power - [][][][]
Skill - []
Stamina - [][][][][]

CHARACTER TYPE - Power Type

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Super Mario
Land 2: 6 Golden Coins", 1992


MISSION EVENT - 100m

OBJECTIVE - "Cross the finish
line while lunging forward and
come in 2nd
   place! (Lift up, then slide
   right when you see the "!"
   indicator.)"

TIPS - This one sounds more
complicated than it actually
is... you're
 basically being told that you
 need to end the race in second
 place and, when you're close to
 the finish line and see a "!",
 simply lift you stylus and
 start sliding it to the right
 side of the screen. The best
 way to accomplish this is by
 facing someone who has high
 speed (such as Sonic or Shadow,
 but NOT both at the same
 time!), run normally, let them
 win AND, when you're really
 next to the finish line,
 perform the task I've just
 mentioned.


MISSION EVENT - 100m Freestyle

OBJECTIVE - "Get a 3 note (...)
rating 5 times when restoring
stamina!"

TIPS - Trace the symbol, as this
event usually requires you, and
when you
 are almost running out of
 stamina press either "R" or "L"
 to restore it. If done
 correctly, you'll achieve the
 required rating each time you
 restore your stamina.


MISSION EVENT - Shooting

OBJECTIVE - "Hit 2 targets at
the same time, twice!"

TIPS - Unlike it usually hapens,
you'll be throw targets two at
each point
 in time. Simply wait until they
 cross each other's path and
 shoot, destroying two with a
 single shot. It may take you a
 while to master it, but it's
 not difficult at all.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Long Jump

OBJECTIVE - "Pass through 10
rings!"

TIPS - Usually, this could sound
like an hard objective, but
you'll be
 taking in a different stage,
 where there are no islands,
 enemies or items. Instead,
 acelerate as much as possible,
 try to aim at 45º angle for the
 jump and keep "Wario" as up as
 possible, entering all the
 rings that cross your path.
 It's also a matter of luck, but
 this isn't that hard.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Race

OBJECTIVE - "Collect all item
boxes!"

TIPS - There's nobody to race
against, and that's a good
thing. Instead of
 rushing across the place,
 simply take your time (don't
 acelerate or use any mushrooms)
 to collect all the item boxes
 that cross your path. Be sure
 to notice the presence of a
 part of this stage which has
 two possible paths to follow,
 and they both contain items. Be
 sure to look for all the item
 boxes, DON'T ACELERATE, and
 you'll be fine - in fact, it is
 even possible to complete this
 stage without
   ever taking the third lap.


FINAL MISSION - Pursuit

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Knuckles when
he's in top condition!"

TIPS - Acelerate as much as
possible (pressing "R" and "L",
as usual),
 pick up all the items that
 cross your path, since they
 restore your stamina, and
 "Knuckles" won't even stand a
 chance to beat you.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? He is
good for swimming or cycling
events, or for
      circuits that require very
      few skill and limited
      speed.



3.5~. Mario

--- STATS ----
Speed - [][][]
Power - [][][
Skill - [][][][
Stamina - [][][]

CHARACTER TYPE - All-Around

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Mario
Bros.", 1983


MISSION EVENT - Long Jump

OBJECTIVE - "Jump successfully
three times for a total of over
20m!"

TIPS - Accomplish three good
jumps, as you'd normally do,
following with
 an angle of close to 45º, and
 this won't be hard at all.


MISSION EVENT - Vault

OBJECTIVE - "Score between 7.000
and 8.000!"

TIPS - Do a good initial jump,
get a couple points in the air,
and do a
 good landing. It's also a
 matter of luck, and there's no
 sure way to instantly do
 exactly what they want.


MISSION EVENT - Shooting

OBJECTIVE - "Shoot down all the
red clays only!"

TIPS - Out of the five clays
thrown, only three of those will
be red. Be
 sure to look at their colour
 and shoot quickly - it's a
 matter of practice, and it may
 take you a while to master what
 you are
   supposed to be doing here.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Long Jump

OBJECTIVE - "Land on one of the
three small islands!"

TIPS - Do the usual run and jump
sequence. Next, try to enter all
the
 golden rings until you reach
 three small islands, placed
 around 600m after the departure
 point. When you get there,
 quickly go down and land on one
 of the islands, but try to aim
 at the very same beginning of
 it, or "Mario" may be thrown to
 the water. As soon as he
 touches the ground, be sure to
 quickly rub him, as that will
 give him some more stability,
 and he won't as easily fall on
 the water.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Boxing

OBJECTIVE - "Counter five
times!"

TIPS - Keep on defending, and
once your opponent strikes with
his right
 fist quickly dodge to your own
 right side, and hit him with a
 quick jab. Repeat four more
 times, and you'll win.


FINAL MISSION - 100m

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Sonic when
he's in top condition!"

TIPS - Your opponent is
obviously much faster than you,
and the only way
 to beat him is by performing a
 successful starting dash,
 followed by the race of your
 life. Without that initial
 boost, you don't stand much of
 a chance against him.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? All-
around characters are good at
almost
      everything, but this one
      is better fit for normal
      table tennis and fencing.
      Also, he is good for
      circuits which have a wide
      variety of events.

Hedgehog CD", 1993


MISSION EVENT - Javelin Throw

OBJECTIVE - "Throw for a
distance between 70m and 85m!"

TIPS - Both luck and skill are
important in this one. Try
different kinds
 of initial runs and different
 angles for throwing the
 javelin, and after a while
 you'll manage to beat it.


MISSION EVENT - Trampoline

OBJECTIVE - "Earn GOOD ratings
for the entire performance!"

TIPS - Simply complete all the
inputs, without failing a single
command,
 and you'll win this one.


MISSION EVENT - Fencing

OBJECTIVE - "Come from behind to
win!"

TIPS - Quickly advance for your
opponent and give it some fast
attacks. If
 done correctly, and you're
 lucky, you'll win like that.


MISSION EVENT - Long Jump

OBJECTIVE - "Get a GREAT rating
on your jump!"

TIPS - Be sure to appeal to
everyone. Then, start with the
best run you
 can do, followed by jumping
 next to the line in an angle of
 around 45º.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Long Jump

OBJECTIVE - "Use items on the
three opponents ahead of you!"

TIPS - It may get you a couple
tries to fulfill this one.
Basically, you
 have to get all the possible
 items and throw them at your
 opponents as quickly as
 possible, in order to eliminate
 them all before you (or them)
 fall on the water. You may want
 to give your character a small
 departure angle (i.e. less than
 30º), since doing so will
 enable you to get the items
 which are close to the
 departure point, making your
 life a lot easier. Keep on
 trying to get items from the
 first three lines, throw them
 as quickly as the item
 selection stops spinning and,
 eventually, you'll win.


FINAL MISSION - Dream Boxing

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Peach when
she's in top condition!"

TIPS - Try to dodge as many of
"Peach"'s attacks, and counter
them all. If
 she uses her special attack and
 you have one of your own, be
 sure to use yours to counter
 hers. She is tougher than she
 looks, but countering her
 special attacks and trying to
 dodge most of her moves is the
 best way to defeat her.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HER? For
events that require running and
involve
      stamina, but she is also
      good at events which
      require jumping. Circuits
      which require limited
power will be good for her, too.

CHARACTER TYPE - All-Around

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Mario

MISSION EVENT - 100m Freestyle

OBJECTIVE - "Earn 3rd place!"

TIPS - Start by giving it
everything you've got. On your
way back, be
 sure to keep track of your
 current position, and hold
 yourself until you're in the
 third place. When that happens,
 start giving it everything you
 got again, and you'll manage to
 complete this objective.


MISSION EVENT - Triple Jump

OBJECTIVE - "Jump between 13m
and 15m!"

TIPS - start with a fair run.
Then, aim at angles around
30~40º and, if
 you're lucky, you may be able
 to do this one without much
 effort.


MISSION EVENT - Archery

OBJECTIVE - "Hit black, red and
blue rings in that specific
order!"

TIPS - Simply do what you're
told. Easy, hum? Sure, there's
some wind, but
 with a bit of practice it
 becomes easier to do.


MISSION EVENT - Table Tennis

OBJECTIVE - "Win five points
using spin shots."

TIPS - Basically, you have to
score five points by using shots
from either
 your "A" or "Y" buttons, which
 is rather easy to do.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Basketball

OBJECTIVE - "Score at least 15
points in 10 consecutive shots!"

TIPS - Throw 10 balls into the
baskets to quickly end this one,
but be
 sure to release the ball ONLY
 when you're absolutely sure
 that you will score that shot.


FINAL MISSION - Dream Race

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Shadow when
he's in top condition!"

TIPS - Race as you'd normally
do, but always take the left
path on the
 bifurcation. Try to jump over
 all the spiky walls, use the
 acquired items in the way that
 better beneficts your current
 situation (if, for example, if
 you have a bomb and you're in a
 clear first place, simply throw
 it away), and always try to
 keep your speed at its maximum
 possible value.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? During
events that require speed and
stamina,
      such as 400m (normal and
      hurdles ones) ones or
      cycling. Circuits which
      require limited stamina
     and power are ok, too.

CHARACTER TYPE - All-Around

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Sonic Rush",
2005


MISSION EVENT - Table Tennis

OBJECTIVE - "Continue a rally
for at least 10 hits!"

TIPS - Extremely easy to do,
simply bounce the ball back for
a couple
 times and you'll win.


MISSION EVENT - Javelin Throw

OBJECTIVE - "Throw 3 times,
increasing your distance each
time!"

TIPS - Usually with the same
angle (I always try to aim at
around 45º),
 give an initial run with
 different speeds and you'll
 manage to do this one.


MISSION EVENT - 10m Platform

OBJECTIVE - "Perform a 20-step
combo with command inputs!"

TIPS - For the initial jump, try
to make it as big as possible,
and then
 fulfill the entire button
 sequence seen in your screen.
 It is easier to do if you
 realise that the available
 sequences are always cyclic,
 and that the buttons you have
 to press tend to repeat
 themselves rather frequently.


MISSION EVENT - 100m

OBJECTIVE - "Finish within 0.5
seconds of Peach!"

TIPS - You don't have to win
this one, just accomplish the
objective
 stated above. So, instead of
 trying to win it, always
 monitor "Peach"'s current
 position and try to keep up
 with her, so that you and she
 cross the finish line next to
 each other.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Shooting

OBJECTIVE - "Win after coming
back from a 200-point deficit!"

TIPS - Try to score as many
points as quickly as possible,
hitting lots of
 combos and as many ballons as
 possible, since they also
 decrease the points that your
 enemies have. This is an hard
 event, and your final result
 depends heavily on who you're
 confronting.


FINAL MISSION - Table Tennis

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Daisy when
she's in top condition!"

TIPS - Try to hit as many quick
moves as possible, and your
opponent will
 soon start missing the ball,
 allowing you to score some
 points.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HER? When
you need a well-balanced
character for one
        of the circuits.



3.9~. Sonic

Speed - [][][][][]

CHARACTER TYPE - Speed Type

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Sonic the
Hedgehog", 1991


MISSION EVENT - 100m

OBJECTIVE - "Perform a
successful starting dash and
finish in 1st place!"

TIPS - Try to do exactly what
you're told, doing a starting
dash that
 allows you to be the first one
 departing from the starting
 line. From there on, just give
 it "Sonic"'s all and you'll be
 fine.


MISSION EVENT - Triple Jump

OBJECTIVE - "Jump at least 15m
with a jump angle of at least 50
degrees!"

TIPS - The biggest problem here
is getting that specific
combination
 angle/distance. Try to inspire
 your character as much as
 possible, followed by a dash as
 quick as possible. As for the
 angles, there's nothing I can
 help you with - keep on trying
 and practising, sooner or later
 you'll manage to do this
 extremely hard task.


MISSION EVENT - 400m Hurdles

OBJECTIVE - "Perform 7 sprint
jumps!"

TIPS - Give it all of "Sonic"'s
speed, and once you're next to a
hurdle
 you must simply tap the
 console's lower screen, which
 makes him jump. Obviously, at
 such a time you should stop
 rubbing the screen, instead
 focusing on jumping - if done
 correctly, this is the action
 that you have to repeat seven
 times, which isn't that hard.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Boxing

OBJECTIVE - "Perform a
successful sway 9 times!"

TIPS - Instead of protecting
yourself, try to dodge the
attacks as quickly
 as possible. You can either try
 to predict the opponent's moves
 (which is slightly hard to do)
 or stick to a pattern, which is
 less effective but may work
 better - something among the
 lines of left, right, left,
 right is perhaps more effective
 than it sounds.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Fencing

OBJECTIVE - "Knock your opponent
out of the ring 3 times to win
the
   match!"

TIPS - Always try to push the
opponent to his corner, and then
either
 parry his attacks or let
 yourself be hit by them, in
 order to raise your special
 bar. When it is full enough
 (i.e. if the number associated
 to it is higher or equal to
 one), quickly use your special
 to throw the opponent out of
 the ring. Be aware this only
 works if the opponent is next
 to his corner, or else he will
 just suffer some damage. Repeat
 until you're done.


FINAL MISSION - 400m

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Mario when
he's in top condition!"

TIPS - The basic idea here is to
try to keep your speed as high
as
 possible, but without ever
 spending any stamina. Bearing
 in mind that "Sonic"'s greatest
 flaw is his lack of stamina, by
 doing so you will be able to
 win without much effort.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM?
Whenever you're facing an event
(or a circuit)
 that requires a lot of speed.

CHARACTER TYPE - Speed Type

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Super Mario
Land", 1989


MISSION EVENT - 400m Hurdles

OBJECTIVE - "Cross the finish
line without knocking down a
hurdle!"

TIPS - This is an easy one,
focus on jumping over all the
hurdles, which
 you can do in the usual
 fashion, and you'll easily get
 across it.


MISSION EVENT - Trampoline

OBJECTIVE - "Achieve seven GOOD
ratings in your performance!"

TIPS - Simply do all the inputs,
without missing a single one,
and you'll
  manage to beat this mission.


MISSION EVENT - Triple Jump

OBJECTIVE - "Achieve a GREAT
rating in all three jumps!"

TIPS - Since the requisites for
"great" jumps appear not to have
been set
 in stone, this ends up being an
 hard mission. Keep on trying,
 using really quick dashes and
 angles close to 45º, and
 eventually you may be able to
 do it.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Table
Tennis

OBJECTIVE - "Successfully return
three consecutive special
shots!"

TIPS - Here, it's all a matter
of whom you're facing, since
some special
 moves are harder to return than
 others. "Tails"' one, for
 example, is close to
 impossible, while "Bowser"'s
 (or "Luigi"'s) one is much
 easier to hit back. Keep on
 getting new characters until
 you find one that you can
 predict, and defeat him. Also,
 there is a small tip that you
 can use - return the first two
 shots normally, and when the
 third one is approaching your
 character be sure to use her
 special attack. If done
 correctly, this will return the
 opponent's special shot with
 one of your own, which is
 perhaps easier to do than
 simply use yet another normal
 return.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Shooting

OBJECTIVE - "Shoot down only the
balloons marked with Daisy's
flower
   symbol!"

TIPS - You just need to be
specially careful with "Tails"'
ballons, since
 those have the same colour as
 "Daisy"'s - yellow - and you
 should always look for the
 flower on the baloon before
 shooting. The first part of the
 level is indeed easy, but the
 second one requires you to shot
 down 12 baloons with 10 bullets
 - a hard task, which becomes a
 lot easier if, by the time you
 have a few bullets left and
 there are no balloons crossing
 the screen, you quickly release
 the content of your weapon and
 reload it - unless you do that,
 you will lose this level, since
 you won't have enough bullets
 for the balloons that will
 later be seen in your screen.


FINAL MISSION - 100m Freestyle

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Blaze when
she's in top condition!"

TIPS - Simply do what you'd
normally do and, provided you
move the stylus
 as quickly as you can and
 restore your stamina when
 required, you will easily win.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HER? For
circuits that require limited
power.

CHARACTER TYPE - Speed Type

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Sonic
Adventure 2", 2001


MISSION EVENT - 100m

OBJECTIVE - "Don't let Sonic
pass you!"

TIPS - The only way to achieve
this objective is by performing
a good
 starting dash, which will allow
 you to quickly be in front of
 "Sonic". If you fail that part
 of the event, your opponent
 will quickly end up in front of
 you and you'll lose. Next, you
 just have to dash as quickly as
 you can - if done correctly,
 and since these two have the
 same speed, you will win.


MISSION EVENT - Javelin Throw

OBJECTIVE - "Throw 3 times in a
row for a total of at least
220m!"

TIPS - Not very difficult, just
perform the quickest dash you
can and try
 to throw the javelin in an
 angle of around 45º.


MISSION EVENT - Cycling

OBJECTIVE - "Collect all of the
stamina!"

TIPS - You face this event
alone, which makes it a lot
easier. Instead of
 rushing across the stage,
 simply take your time, and try
 to get the stamina as quickly
 as possible. It's not
 impossible to collect all
 pieces of stamina in a single
 lap, but it's easier if you do
 it in two laps, with the second
 one serving for the items that
 you may have missed in your
 first one.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Fencing

OBJECTIVE - "Win with a special
attack as your final move!"

TIPS - Attack as usual, but be
sure to store at least one
special attack
 for the end. When you see that
 your opponent is actually weak
 enough, i.e. when one or two
 extra jabs would defeat it,
 simple get close to him/her and
 launch your special attack, an
 action that will probably end
 this stage.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Race

OBJECTIVE - "Use items on all of
your opponents."

TIPS - Instead of rushing across
the stage, focus on getting new
items to
 throw at your opponents. Red
 and green shells, for example,
 are specially good to throw the
 opponents in front of you. If,
 later on, the only opponents
 left are behind you, reduce
 your speed (you can do so by
 hitting the green walls or the
 limits of the stage) and wait
 until they are in front of you
 to throw them some item.


FINAL MISSION - Dream Shooting

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Luigi when
he's in top condition!"

TIPS - Perform this event as
you'd normally do, but be aware
that "Luigi"
 is slightly faster than he
 would normally be.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? Just
like a certain friend of his,
this is a
      character that you should
      use in events (or
      circuits) that only
      require a lot of speed.

MISSION EVENT - 10m Platform

OBJECTIVE - "Enter the water
feet-first! Aim for an entry
angle of around
   170 to 180 degrees."

TIPS - You can neglect the other
parts of this events, but after
the
 command input you should simply
 wait until your character is
 looking up and then quickly
 press "A". It's all a matter of
 timing.


MISSION EVENT - Table Tennis

OBJECTIVE - "Win without giving
away more than three points to
your
   opponent!"

TIPS - Play this event as you
would normally do, but don't let
your
 opponent get more than three
 points, just like the objective
 tells you. This is easier to do
 if you're facing characters
 weaker at this event, such as
 "Bowser".


MISSION EVENT - Trampoline

OBJECTIVE - "Enter 32 or more
performance commands!"

TIPS - While in the air, try to
correctly follow as many
performance
 commands as possible. There's
 no tip I can give you, simply
 try to do them all as quickly
 as possible.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Basketball

OBJECTIVE - "Make five
consecutive successful shots!"

TIPS - Not very hard, be ONLY
throw the ball when you are 100%
sure that
 you will be hitting a basket.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Canoe

OBJECTIVE - "Gather 20 coins
within 60 seconds!"

TIPS - The basic idea here is
trying to get as many coins as
possible,
 while collecting items that
 will help take coins away from
 your opponents. Keep on heading
 to item points, getting new
 coins on your way there, and as
 soon as you get red shells use
 them, since they will stalk
 your opponents and give you
 important coins quickly. It's a
 matter of luck and timing, try
 it a couple times and, sooner
 or later, you'll be able to do
 it.


FINAL MISSION - 400m Hurdles

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Tails when
he's in top condition!"

TIPS - There's not much I can
advise you here, just try to do
a good
 starting dash and maximize the
 points at which you travel at
 high speed, lifting the stylus
 for a bit before attempting to
 jump each hurdle. Since your
 opponent isn't normally that
 quick, the difference victory
 and a loss relies only on your
 starting dash, which may easily
 put you in front of him.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? Mostly
for the 400m hurdles event, or
circuits
      which rely heavily on
      running events.

CHARACTER TYPE - Skill Type

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Super Mario

MISSION EVENT - Vault

OBJECTIVE - "Nail a perfect
landing!"

TIPS - It doesn't need to be
"perfect", but your character
must be left
 standing at the end of the
 jump. Try to tap the place
 where her feet will be standing
 and it will go fine.


MISSION EVENT - Long Jump

OBJECTIVE - "Jump between 6m and
7m!"

TIPS - It's more a matter of
luck that anything else... a
good idea ends
 up being the one of giving it
 your all, and once your speed
 is locked you should some
 meters before the actual line -
 it may require some practise,
 but if done correctly you'll
 have an easier
time getting the required mark.


MISSION EVENT - 10m Platform

OBJECTIVE - "Achieve a 10 combo
chain or better!"

TIPS - Start with a jump as
powerful as possible (as usual,
hold the "A"
 button until the bar is filled)
 and then input the sequence
 that will appear. If you input
 the 10 keys shown in there,
 you'll win.


MISSION EVENT - Fencing

OBJECTIVE - "Win without giving
up a point to your opponent!"

TIPS - You may want to get an
easy opponent for this one, such
as "Bowser"
 or "Dr. Eggman". Next, attack
 as much as you can and,
 hopefully, the opponent will
 never manage to hit you - for
 some reason, they seem weaker
 when you're facing this
 mission.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Shooting

OBJECTIVE - "Achieve 10
consecutive hits!"

TIPS - While facing this event,
be sure to shot ONLY when you're
 absolutely sure that you'll hit
 something (no, shields won't
 count, and they'll even reset
 the counter). Your score isn't
 important at all, you just have
 to shot ONLY when you are going
 to hit something, and if you
 actually follow that advice you
 will win this stage rather
 easily.


FINAL MISSION - Dream Table
Tennis

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Amy when she's
in top condition!"

TIPS - Even at "top condition",
your opponent isn't much a
threat. Simply
 demolish her as you'd normally
 do, using "Peach"'s own special
 attack to counter the one of
 her opponent, and everything
 will go fine.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HER?
Swimming events, or circuits
which require close
          to no power.

CHARACTER TYPE - Skill Type

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Sonic the

MISSION EVENT - Shooting

OBJECTIVE - "Don't miss even
once!"

TIPS - "Practice makes
perfection", that's a phrase
which fully applies
 here. You just have to hit all
 the moving targets, which
 you'll be able to easily do
 after training a bit.


MISSION EVENT - Vault

OBJECTIVE - "Don't make any
mistakes on your four
performance command
   inputs!"

TIPS - Be sure to press the
jumper, an action which gives
you more time to
 do the performance commands.
 Then, just don't do any
 mistakes, will you? It's not
 that hard to accomplish.


MISSION EVENT - Trampoline

OBJECTIVE - "Earn GOOD ratings 8
times in your performance!"

TIPS - Fully input all the keys
you're asked to and you'll
accomplish this
 easy goal.


MISSION EVENT - Archery

OBJECTIVE - "Hit the center of
the target to earn 10 points
under strong
   wind conditions!"

TIPS - Practice this event
before attempting to do this,
and always keep
 track of the wind before
 unleashing your arrow - failure
 to do so
will lead to your harsh defeat.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Race

OBJECTIVE - "Reach the goal
without taking damage even
once!"

TIPS - This ends up being way
harder than it sounds. Since you
don't have
 to win the race, simply wait
 until all your opponents have
 reached a significant part of
 the race before actually
 attempting to reach your goal.
 Try to jump while running, but
 be aware that sometimes your
 opponents will throw items at
 you, which actually count as
 damage and will make you lose
 the event. Also, if you ever
 get the green shield item, use
 it as quickly as possible,
 since that one actually
 protects you against damage,
 i.e. you may be damaged twice
 before losing.


FINAL MISSION - Dream Canoe

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Yoshi when
he's in top condition!"

TIPS - Even though you have
three opponents while facing
this event, be
 sure to remember that you just
 have to defeat "Yoshi", and
 none of the others. Get as many
 items as possible, and use them
 to receive coins that your
 other opponents may have
 captured, specially the green
 dinosaur, since he is the one
 that matters the most. Also,
 try to dodge all the items
 thrown at you, since they are
 also an important threat here.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? For
table tennis, jumping events, or
circuits
      which rely mostly on skill
      and stamina.

CHARACTER TYPE - Skill Type

FIRST APPEARANCE - "Mario
Tennis", 2000


MISSION EVENT - 400m Hurdles

OBJECTIVE - "Overcome a 3-second
handicap to win!"

TIPS - Once more, it all comes
up to characters that you are
facing. Ones
 such as "Tails" are hard to
 defeat, but remember that you
 can get different opponents by
 exiting this mode and later re-
 entering it, which is actually
 worth a shot here.


MISSION EVENT - Shooting

OBJECTIVE - "Shoot all the blue
targets only!"

TIPS - Out of five targets,
three of them are blue, and
therefore this
 event depends only on your own
 skills.


MISSION EVENT - Vault

OBJECTIVE - "Earn a 10.000!"

TIPS - Asking for a perfect
score, hum? Yes, this is as hard
as it sounds,
 and it may take you quite a
 while to successfully
 accomplish what you are asked
 for in here. You need to have a
 full dash before jumping, a
 time during which you should
 press the jumper. In the air,
 try to do all the motions
 you're asked for (they are
 random, and you may want to try
 several times to see all the
 motions available and how hard
 to complete they actually are)
 and land without falling. If
 you follow all these
 guidelines, you'll be closer to
 that perfect score, but
 ultimately it also depends on
 your own personal skills.


MISSION EVENT - Triple Jump

OBJECTIVE - "Jump 3 times in a
row for a total of at least
48m!"

TIPS - Aim at the best
inspiration possible, do the
best dash you can and
 try to get angles around 45º in
 all three jumps. You may have
 to practise for a while before
 you manage to do this entire
 task, but it isn't as hard as
 some of the Triple Jump events
 that other characters are asked
 for.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Canoe

OBJECTIVE - "Avoid your
opponents' attacks for 30
seconds!"

TIPS - Move around for a bit,
and try to conceal your position
to the back
 of one of the big mountains.
 Before you notice it, the time
 will be over without much
 effort - don't bother with
 either coins or items, since
 they aren't helpful for the
 task you're trying to achieve.


FINAL MISSION - Dream Fencing

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Dr. Eggman
when he's in top condition!"

TIPS - Really easy, just strike
as much as you can, use your
special move
 as soon as you attain one (this
 one throws a tetris-like block
 at your opponent, and is
 effective even at long range)
 and sooner than later you'll
 win.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? For
events which require jumping,
table tennis or
      circuits which require
      high skill and a lot of
            stamina.

MISSION EVENT - Long Jump

OBJECTIVE - "Jump at least 6m
with a jump angle of at least 50
degrees!"

TIPS - It may take you a while
to master this one, but at least
it is
 easier than doing triple jumps.
 After full inspiration and a
 good dash, try to aim at an
 angle between 50º and 60º,
 which will make it possible for
 you to easily reach this goal.


MISSION EVENT - 400m

OBJECTIVE - "Keep your stamina
full up to the goal, and finish
in 1st
   place!"

TIPS - This ends up being easier
than it sounds, but it may also
depend on
 who you're facing. Instead of
 looking at your opponents,
 constantly look at your stamina
 bar and focus only on keeping
 it from ever being used, since
 that would lead to your defeat.
 Instead of rubbing the lower
 screen, as you'd normally do,
 it is better if you do some
 slow rubs, as they make it
 easier to keep track on the
 speed bar, and easily allow you
 to focus on the stamina issue.


MISSION EVENT - Hammer Throw

OBJECTIVE - "Perform a
successfull yell 3 throws in a
row! (Make noise
   towards the microphone when
   you see the "!" indicator.)"

TIPS - How well you throw your
hammer isn't important here.
Instead,
 exactly after you throw it,
 you'll see a small "!" sign
 appearing next to your
 character - when that happens,
 quickly produce some sort of
 noise, either yelling or
 tapping the console's
 microphone will do.


MISSION EVENT - Javelin Throw

OBJECTIVE - "Perform a GREAT
throw!"

TIPS - In order to achieve that
objective, you need to perform
the best
 initial dash possible, along
 with a throw angle of around
 45º, and you should only throw
 the Javelin when your character
 is as close to the line as
 possible. It may take you a
 while to master all these
 sections, but it's not that
 hard to do.


MISSION EVENT - Dream Basketball

OBJECTIVE - "Score a basket!"

TIPS - This one is also a very
easy mission - you just have to
score a
 single point, by throwing the
 ball into one of the baskets.
 The only problem is that they
 are moving faster than usual,
 and that will be it - score
 once, even if it ends up being
 with a lucky strike, and you'll
 win.


FINAL MISSION - Cycling

OBJECTIVE - "Beat Waluigi when
he's in top condition!"

TIPS - The trick here is using
"Waluigi"'s position to move
faster without
 spending any of your own
 stamina, and then surpass him
 when you reach the final lap,
 an action which you should
 follow with a quick dash. If
 done correctly, you'll be able
 to defeat him without much
 effort.


WHEN SHOULD YOU USE HIM? For
events which require jumping, or
for swimming
      ones.



4~. Events

Next, you'll be able to read
some information on the many
events that this game has to
offer. Sure, you may read in-
game descriptions of the
controls before actually facing
each event, but those
descriptions aren't always that
good, and I'll also be including
some tips, which are obviously
worth your time. If you're
having trouble with any kind of
event, read its own section and
you'll probably learn all there
is to know about them. All
events are described with easy-
to-understand guidelines,
telling you exactly the steps
that you have to follow in each
event, but be aware that you can
also press "Set Rules", before
facing each event, to change
some of its options - usually,
only the skill level of the COM
opponents is possible to be
changed, but particular events
offer other choices.



4.1~. Athletics

These seven events are, usually,
considered to be some of the
most important ones that the
Olympic Games have to offer.
They've been around for
centuries, and they obviously
play an important role in this
game.



4.1.1~. 100m

The main objective of this event
is being the first one to cross
the finish line, and they're one
of the easiest (and simplest)
events this game has to offer.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When you see the word
   "Ready?" on the upper screen,
   press the lower screen with
   your stylus. A few seconds
   later, when "Go!" is seen in
   that very same place, quickly
   drag your stylus to the left
   - doing so will perform a
   good starting dash.

3. Quickly drag your stylus from
   the left to the right side
   (and vice-versa) of the
   screen. The faster you drag
   it, the quicker your
   character will run.

4. When you're reaching the
   finish line, you'll see a "!"
   symbol next to your
   character. If, by then, you
   quickly drag your stylus to
   the right side of the screen,
   he will move slightly faster
   for a very short amount of
   time.

As you can now understand, this
is probably one of the simplest
mini-games this product has to
offer. If you get to choose a
character for this event, I
suggest you go for either
"Sonic" or "Shadow", since speed
is all that matters here.



4.1.2~. 400m

One could think that this event
follows the very same controls
as the previous one, but that
just isn't true. Instead,
stamina now applies, meaning
that your characters will run
tired after a while, they can't
just go and dash as much as they
want. However, the basic goal is
still the same, being the first
to cross the finish line.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When you see the word
   "Ready?" on the upper screen,
   press the lower screen with
   your stylus. A few seconds
   later, when "Go!" is seen in
   that very same place, quickly
   drag your stylus to the left
   - doing so will perform a
   good starting dash.

3. After the previous step,
   quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and back. The
   faster you drag it, the
   quicker your character will
   run, but your stamina will
   also deplete faster.

4. During the race, you should
   be specially careful with the
   bar seen in the upper left
   corner of the upper screen,
   which shows your current
   speed. If it is shown as
   between the yellow line and
   the end of the bar, it will
   mean that you're losing
   stamina, which you can check
   in the small heart seen next
   to your character - in order
   to regenerate it, simply drag
   your stylus slower, to keep
   your speed left of the yellow
   line.

5. When you're reaching the
   finish line, you'll see a "!"
   symbol next to your
   character. If, by then, you
   quickly drag your stylus to
   the right side of the screen,
   he will move slightly faster
   for a very short amount of
   time.

Optimal characters for this
event would be either "Amy" or
"Knuckles", who have good speed
and fair stamina, but going for
"Sonic" or "Shadow" also seems
to work just fine.



4.1.3~. 400m Hurdles

This one follows the general
lines of the "400m" event, but
adds hurdles to the field.
Unlike what happens in other
games of this genre, knocking
these elements down doesn't
increase your finish time, or
significantly slows down your
characters. However, just for
fun (or realism), you may want
to jump above the hurdles, as
you attempt to reach the final
goal of being the first one to
reach the finish line.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When you see the word
   "Ready?" on the upper screen,
   press the lower screen with
   your stylus. A few seconds
   later, when "Go!" is seen in
   that very same place, quickly
   drag your stylus to the left
   - doing so will perform a
   good starting dash.

3. After the previous step,
   quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and back. The
   faster you drag it, the
   quicker your character will
   run, but your stamina will
   also deplete faster.

4. During the race, you should
   be specially careful with the
   bar seen in the upper left
   corner of the upper screen,
   which shows your current
   speed. If it is shown as
   between the yellow line and
   the end of the bar, it will
   mean that you're losing
   stamina, which you can check
   in the small heart seen to
   your character - in order to
   regenerate it, simply drag
   your stylus slower, to keep
   your speed left of the yellow
   line.

5. When a hurdle is seen next to
   your character, tap stop
   dragging the stylus and give
   a quick tap to the lower
   screen. Doing so will make
   your character jump over the
   hurdle.

6. When you're reaching the
   finish line, you'll see a "!"
   symbol next to your
   character. If, by then, you
   quickly drag your stylus to
   the right side of the screen,
   he will move slightly faster
   for a very short amount of
   time.

You can actually manage to beat
this event with characters such
as "Knuckles", who has good
speed and fair stamina, but
"Tails", "Daisy" and "Sonic" are
also good options.



4.1.4~. Long Jump

This one is a classic, an event
which all track and field games
appear to have. Your goal is the
one of jumping farther than all
your opponents, and you have
three attempts to do so.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. Before the actual event, you
   can clap your hands (or give
   small touches in the
   microphone, if you're playing
   in a public place) to inspire
   your character. I'm not sure
   if it really works or it's
   just psychology working, but
   you might as well do it. You
   can skip it by pressing "B".

3. Quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and back, until
   you see a "Speed Locked"
   message. Shortly after, a big
   arrow will show up - quickly
   move your stylus in that
   direction to settle the angle
   for your jump, counting from
   an horizontal line - 45º is
   probably the best possible
   angle.

4. You may want to time your
   jump, so that you leave the
   floor as close to the line as
   possible, but be careful not
   to surpass it, or you'll be
   disqualified. Other factors
   that influenciate your final
   result are the speed of your
   initial dash and the actual
   angle of your jump.

You may want to try both "Amy"
or "Dr. Eggman" for this event,
since they appear to be slightly
better at the overall task than
all others.



4.1.5~. Triple Jump

The previous one sounded simple,
right? Well, the Trimple Jump is
almost like performing three of
those smallers jumps in a row,
and they are a lot harder to
time and successfully complete.
As before, your goal is jumping
farther than all your opponents,
and you have three attempts to
do so.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. Before the actual event, you
   can clap your hands (or give
   small touches in the
   microphone, if you're playing
   in a public place) to inspire
   your character. I'm not sure
   if it really works or it's
   just psychology working, but
   you might as well do it. You
   can skip it by pressing "B".

3. Quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and back, until
   you see a "Speed Locked"
   message.

4. A few seconds later, you'll
   see a big arrow. When you're
   next to the line, quickly
   move your stylus in that
   direction to settle the angle
   for your first jump. Once
   more, 45º is probably the
   best possible angle for all
   the jumps.

5. Whenever your character
   touches the ground, quickly
   move your stylus, in order to
   perform two other jumps. The
   angles are calculated in the
   same way as before.

6. You may want to time your
   jumps, so that you first
   leave the floor as close to
   the line as possible, but be
   careful not to surpass it, or
   you'll be disqualified. Other
   factors that influenciate
   your final result are the
   speed of your initial dash
   and the angles of all your
   three jumps.

"Sonic" and "Dr. Eggman" are
some of the best characters for
this particular event, for some
strange reasons.



4.1.6~. Javelin Throw

People sure love to throw stuff
at each other, don't they? Well,
here you will be throwing a
javelin, with your goal being
the one of having this item
achieve the longest possible
distance, outdoing the marks of
your opponents. You have three
attempts to do so.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. Quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and back, until
   you see a "Speed Locked"
   message.

3. A few seconds later, you'll
   see a big arrow pointing to
   the lower left corner.
   Quickly move your stylus in
   that direction and hold it.
   Almost instantly, another
   arrow will appear - when
   you're nearer the the line,
   move it in that direction to
   settle the angle of your
   throw, with 45º being the
   optimal value.

4. Both the speed of your dash,
   the angle of the throw and
   the power of your character
   influenciate the result.

For this event, you may want to
try characters who have a lot of
power, such as "Bowser" or
"Knuckles".



4.1.7~. Hammer Throw

If throwing a javelin just isn't
for you, you can also throw a
strange hammer at the field.
Your goal, as before, is the one
of having this item achieve the
longest possible distance,
outdoing the marks of your other
opponents. As usual, you have
three attempts to do so.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. Draw circles with your
   stylus, as seen with the
   shiny circle, until a
   countdown from three up to
   one appears. That countdown
   reaches one, let your
   character give yet another
   spin, and then lift the
   stylus, which will throw the
   hammer.

3. When the hammer is in the
   air, a small "!" will be seen
   next to your character. You
   can either scream or give
   gentle taps to the console's
   microphone, as doing so
   appears to increase the power
   with which the hammer is
   thrown.

Here, you may want to pick a
powerful character, such as
"Bowser" or "Knuckles".



4.2~. Aquatics

Aquatic sports are fairly new,
and that's easy to understand
when you see the number of
representative they have in this
game - only two modalities,
something which is indeed
limited.



4.2.1~. 100m Freestyle

At first, it may look like
there's not much "freestyle" in
this mini-game, but such feature
was implemented in an
interesting way. Regardless of
this mention, your goal is
simply being the first one to
complete a trip to the other
side of the swimming pool and
back, which is harder than it
sounds.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When all the five characters
   are in the podium, and you
   see the word "Ready?" on the
   upper screen, press the lower
   screen with your stylus. A
   few seconds later, when "Go!"
   is seen in that very same
   place, be sure to quickly
   drag your stylus to the left
   - doing so will perform a
   good starting dash.

3. When in the water, trace the
   shape seen in the lower
   screen. That shape changes
   depending on the character
   you're controlling
   ("freestyle", you get it?),
   and doing so will make your
   character move faster, but he
   will also lose his stamina
   quicker.

4. If your character is running
   out of stamina (which you can
   monitor by looking at the
   heart placed next to your
   character), quickly press "L"
   or "R". The less stamina you
   have, the more this command
   will restore.

5. When you reach the other side
   of the pool, a small "!" will
   be seen next to your
   character. When that happens,
   quickly tap the lower screen
   in order to perform a quick
   dash on your way back.

6. When you're going back to the
   right side of the swimming
   pool, keep on repeating the
   very same shape from before.

Characters such as "Dr. Eggman"
and "Peach" are your best option
here, since they tend to swim
fairly quick and the shape you
must follow for them is really
easy (a circle and a straight
line).



4.2.2~. 10m Platform

Jumping out of a platform held
10 meters above the ground isn't
for everyone, but this game
actually makes it fun. Your
objective is to get more points
than your opponents, in the
three different jumps you have
to perform, with your final
score being the sum of points
that you've achieved in the
total of the three jumps.

1. This event is played by using
   the buttons on the right side
   of the console (A, B, X and
   Y).

2. When your character is on top
   of the platform, hold "A" to
   see a small bar reacting. Try
   to have that bar as filled as
   possible before releasing the
   button.

3. A few seconds later, when
   your character is in the air,
   you will see the appearance
   of a certain combination of
   buttons. Input it as quickly
   as possible, but try not to
   miss any keys at all.

4. Shortly after, you'll see a
   small cutscene, which
   generally depicts your
   current character screaming,
   or something among those
   lines. Once that happens,
   he/she will start spinning
   around, and you'll be offered
   the chance to press "A". Do
   so ONLY when your character
   is looking down, directly
   over the vertical axis, for
   best results.

5. The last part is specially
   important, since a bad angle
   will heavily hurt your score,
   but all parts of this event
   give you a certain number of
   points, depending on how good
   you performed them.

When it comes to picking someone
to face this event, "Tails" and
"Waluigi" are probably your best
choices.



4.3~. Gymnastics

These are events hard to mimic
in a computer game, and so it
ends up being interesting to see
the way they used to transpose
them to a virtual enviroment.
They don't do much justice to
the actual sports, but at least
they're amusing and easy to
perform.



4.3.1~. Trampoline

Jumping on top of a trampoline,
you have to perform as many
combinations as possible. The
ultimate target is getting
enough points to beat all your
opponents, ranging in a scale
between 0 and 10.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When your character starts
   the event, give him some
   quick upward drags whenever
   he touches the trampoline.
   When he reaches a certain
   height, the level will
   proceed.

3. Each time your character is
   in the air, try to use your
   stylus to quickly mime the
   forms shown in the screen.
   Whenever he goes back down to
   the trampoline, give him
   another upward drag.

4. It is possible to perform up
   to 30 jumps, but you should
   be aware that the sequences
   you must input become harder
   as you increase your number
   of jumps, and even if that
   doesn't penalize your final
   score, it may make it harder
   to achieve certain scores.

Strangely, the character you
pick for this event doesn't seem
to be important at all. I've
tried "Tails", "Bowser" and some
others, always with very similar
results.



4.3.2~. Vault

This even is shorter, but yet
harder than its predecessor.
Your goal is simply getting more
points (in a scale from 0 up to
10) than all your opponents, and
you have two attempts to do so,
with the final score being the
average of points which you got
in those two attempts.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. Start by quickly (as quickly
   as possible!) dragging the
   stylus from the left to the
   right side of the screen,
   until the speed bar is
   filled. Very, very soon you
   will see the vault (your
   character will display a
   rapid "!" sign when he reches
   it), and you MUST quickly tap
   it to perform a good jump,
   which makes it possible to
   effectively play the next
   part.

3. When you're in the air,
   you'll see some shapes, with
   a number in each of their
   vertices. What you have to do
   is quickly tap those
   vertices, in an increasing
   order (from one up to the
   highest number), be aware
   that you must do it as
   quickly as possible, and You
   will gain points by each
   tapped vertice.

4. After you've done four
   different shapes, you'll
   start falling to the ground.
   When you see your character
   almost reaching the floor,
   tap his feet, to make a
   perfect landing. Be aware
   that you may also quickly tap
   the middle area of the bar
   that will appear to get a
   similar effect, but then
   you'll receive less points.

Once more, the character you
pick for this event doesn't
appear to be important at all. I
tried "Tails", "Vector", "Mario"
and "Bowser" and always managed
to get very similar results.



4.4~. Archery

Archery has been around for
centuries, and just like in real
life you may have to practice a
lot in this game before managing
to get the best results out of
any character. Just like they do
in all those classical "Robin
Hood" films, you can hit the
center of bullseye to get 10
points,
 with the other bigger circles
 awarding you less points. In
 the end, the
goal is getting more points than
all your opponents, during the
12 shooting attempts that you
are allowed to make.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When you start playing, drag
   the stylus down once, to pull
   the string of your bow. Next,
   aim at the center of the
   bullseye and lift your stylus
   to actually send your arrow
   flying towards its target.

3. At first, this sounds simple,
   but as you advance further
   the environment will become
   *magically* more windy, and
   it will be harder to aim at
   the proper location. This is
   where practice starts
   mattering, since it will make
   it easier for you to
   understand where you should
   be pointing your arrow at, in
   order to hit the center of
   the bullseye.

Characters with high skill, such
as "Tails" and ones with a lot
of power (as "Bowser") appear to
be good choices for this event.



4.5~. Dream Events

Unlike the other events
available in this game, these
are based on actual Olympic
modalities, or other sports, but
they come with a twist, such as
collectable coins, special
powers, items that damage your
opponents or miraculous jumps.
They're fun, even though they
don't really belong on the real
Olympic Games, and you'll
probably enjoy them.



4.5.1~. Dream Race

Unlike what happens in the
normal races available in this
game, where you just need to
control the speed of your
characters, this one is slightly
different, since you also have
to control their direction and
avoid some obstacles. You and
your opponents can gather
mystery boxes, which contain
important usable items, and your
goal is simply being the first
one to cross the finish line,
after three laps across the
field.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and other buttons.

2. When you see the word
   "Ready?" on the upper screen,
   press the lower screen with
   your stylus. A few seconds
   later, when "Go!" is seen in
   that very same place, quickly
   drag your stylus to the front
   of the screen - doing so will
   perform a good starting dash.

3. Quickly drag your stylus from
   the left to the right side
   (and vice-versa) of the
   screen. The faster you drag
   it, the quicker the speed of
   your character will increase,
   but if you stop dragging the
   stylus your speed will be
   maintained until you're hit
   by an item, obstacle or wall.
   If that happens, simply
   increase your speed once
   again, by repeating this
   action.

4. To move your character in the
   field, you can either press
   left and right (or "A" and
   "Y"), and you can jump over
   obstacles by quickly tapping
   the lower screen. Failure to
   do so will slightly lower the
   current speed of your
   character.

5. Eventually, you will see some
   boxes in the field - touching
   one of those awards you a
   single item. In the lower
   screen, you'll see the item
   box spinning, and after a
   while it will stop, showing
   you what item you just
   acquired: there's a mushroom
   (increases your speed for a
   limited amount of time), a
   green shell (flies forward,
   hitting someone who is in
   front of it), a red shell
   (homes an opponent), a bomb
   (thrown in front of you, it
   explodes and damages those
   who are next to it), a shield
   (protects you from damage
   once) and a block (which
   drops blocks in front of all
   your other opponents). All
   effects can be sent to the
   back of your character by
   holding the "down" key. To
   use these items, simply tap
   the item box or press "L" (or
   "R"), and be aware the
   opponent character affected
   by them will see his/her
   speed heavily decreased.

For this one, you may want to
take the fastest possible
character, such as "Sonic" or
"Shadow".



4.5.2~. Dream Canoe

Unlike the Canoeing available in
the actual Olympic Games, this
one is very different from a
simple race. Instead of having
to reach a particular goal in
first place, you have to collect
more coins that all your
opponents, which is easier said
than done.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and other buttons.

2. Quickly drag your stylus up
   and down to increase the
   speed of your own canoe, and
   control your direction by
   using left and right (or "A"
   and "Y"). Tapping the lower
   screen makes your character
   jump, which is useful to
   avoid items thrown at you.

3. Since the final goal is
   getting as many coins as
   possible, you should try to
   locate them in the map (they
   show up as huge golden orbs)
   and quickly head to those
   locations.

4. Eventually, you will see some
   boxes in the sea - touching
   one of those awards you a few
   items. In the lower screen,
   you'll see the item box
   spinning, and after a while
   it will stop, showing you
   what items you just acquired:
   there are green shell (flies
   forward, hitting anyone who
   is in front of it), a red
   shell (homes opponents), a
   blue winged shell (magically
   hits an opponent, no matter
   when they are), a star (makes
   you invencible for a limited
   amount of time) and a bomb
   (thrown in front of you, it
   explodes and damages those
   who are next to it). All
   effects can be sent to the
   back of your character by
   holding the "down" key. To
   use an item, simply tap the
   item box or press "L" (or
   "R"), and be aware the
   opponent character affected
   by them will lose some of
   their coins, but the same
   happens to you, if you're hit
   with an item.

Since this is an unusual event,
I would suggest you use some
sort of all-around character,
such as "Mario" or "Luigi", to
face it.



4.5.3~. Dream Boxing

I never knew Boxing was actually
played at the Olympic games, but
this game makes it fun. Here,
your goal is hitting your
opponent as hard as you can,
putting him on the floor either
by Knock Out ("KO") or Technical
Knock Out ("TKO"), and to do so
you have to enter a small
tournament where you get to face
two different characters.

1. This event is played by using
   buttons ONLY.

2. Press "A" to give a straight
   punch with your right fist,
   "Y" to give a couple quick
   punches with your left fist,
   and be aware that you can
   increase the power of those
   attacks by pressing up (or
   down) as you strike your
   opponent, with each
   combination resulting in a
   different kind of attack.

3. You can also hold "L" (or
   "R") to protect from physical
   attacks, and dodge opponent's
   punches by pressing left and
   right in time with his own
   strikes.

4. Eventually, these actions
   will increase your special
   meter, and once it displays
   (at least) one small golden
   ball, you can press "X" to
   launch your special punch. If
   your opponent throws this
   kind of technique at you, you
   can quickly hold "L" (or "R")
   to defend it, suffering less
   damage. Also, be aware that
   this move can countered, if
   you (or your opponent) have
   at least one special punch
   left, which is easy to notice
   by looking at their gloves -
   if they're sparkling, they
   have at least one special
   left. To counter it, simply
   press "X" when a prompt
   appears on the screen, which
   leads to a small mini-game
   where you have to tap "A" as
   quickly as possible - the
   winner damages his opponent
   and suffers no damage.

5. Each time somebody's health
   drops down to zero, that
   character will fall to the
   ground, and his opponent will
   have his health increased for
   a little bit. If your
   character is in the ground,
   you'll have to

   quickly tap "A" to get him
   up. The character who fails
   to get up will lose by KO,
   but if someone falls to the
   ground three times that
   player will lose by TKO.

This is the kind of event you
should take a powerful character
to, someone like "Bowser" or
"Vector".



4.5.4~. Dream Long Jump

Unlike the other events which
require you to jump, this one
puts you to perform a miraculous
jump, followed by a glide in the
middle of the air and landing in
one of the small islands. The
ultimate goal is the one of
landing in an island more
distant than the one of all your
opponents, and even if you have
three attempts to do so, be
aware that landing on the water
(or failing to jump out of the
platform) instantly leads you to
a foul.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and some buttons.

2. Quickly drag the stylus from
   the left to the right side of
   the screen, and back, until
   you see a "Speed Locked"
   message. Shortly after, a big
   arrow will show up - when you
   are reaching the end of the
   platform, quickly move your
   stylus in that direction to
   settle the angle for your
   jump, counting from an
   horizontal line - 45º is
   generally the best.

3. Depending on your speed and
   jump angle, you'll fly higher
   or lower in the sky. From
   there on, use the control pad
   (or the buttons on the right
   side, such as "A", "B", "X"
   and "Y") to control the
   direction of your character's
   glide. While left and right
   control his movement
   direction, pressing up makes
   him climb (and lose speed),
   while pressing down increases
   his speed but makes your
   character approach the sea.

4. Eventually, you will see the
   direction of the wind
   changing, and that's
   something that you need to
   use for your advantage. If
   possible, try to move in the
   direction of the wind, as
   doing so will help you move.

5. It's easy to notice the
   presence of some rings in the
   field - just like what
   happened in a certain
   classical Sega game, passing
   through them increases your
   speed. You can also pick up
   items, by grabbing some of
   the boxes seen floating on
   the air, which you can later
   use by pressing "L" (or "R")
   or tapping the proper square.
   The items included in this
   event are a green shell
   (flies in straight in front
   of you), a red shell (which
   homes one opponent), a star
   (makes you invencible and
   increases your speed for a
   while), a shield (protects
   you from damage), an emerald
   (raises wind that affects all
   opponents) and a boot
   (increases your speed). All
   effects can be sent to the
   back of your character by
   holding the "down" key.

6. When you see that your
   character is getting too
   close to the ocean, you may
   want to land in one of the
   small islands. If you land
   too close to the ocean (which
   generally happens in small
   islands), you will have to
   quickly drag the stylus from
   left to the right side of the
   screen (and back) to prevent
   your character from falling
   in the water.

All-Around characters, such as
"Mario" or "Luigi", are probably
your best choices for this
particular event, but "Yoshi" is
also a good pick.



4.5.5~. Dream Table Tennis

Unlike the normal table tennis,
which is also represented in
this same product, this unusual
version comes with a different
scoring mechanic and allows
characters to unleash special
attacks. The winning condition
is easy to understand, the first
one to reach 50 points wins, and
you'll be playing the event as a
small tournament where you have
to defeat two different
characters to achieve the best
possible position.

1. This event is played by using
   buttons ONLY.

2. Start by tossing the ball,
   which you can do by pressing
   "A" (or either "B" and "Y").
   Next, you can move left and
   right by pressing those very
   same keys, and when you and
   your opponent are returning
   the ball to each other, each
   of the controls stated above
   perform a different kind of
   shot - "A" spins the ball
   right, "B" performs a
   straight hit (by correctly
   timing it, you'll do a fast
   smash shot) and "Y" spins the
   ball left. Also, you can
   change the direction of the
   ball by pressing left (or
   right) while you are
   returning it.

3. As you return the ball, and
   depending on the shots you
   perform, your special bar
   will increase, adding golden
   balls to your character. When
   you have at least one golden
   ball up, you can press "X" to
   unleash a special attack,
   with its effect depending on
   the character you're playing
   with.

4. You can easily see a counter
   increasing its value as you
   and your opponent return the
   ball - when one of you
   manages to make the ball
   surpass the opponent, he will
   gain the number of points
   mentioned on that counter. Be
   sure to notice that you can
   use your own special move to
   counter the effect of the
   opponent's one, if you
   properly time it.

"Tails" and "Waluigi", due to
their amazing special shot and
high skill, are probably the
best characters you can take for
this event. A special mention
should be given to "Bowser", who
is simply awful at this event.



4.5.6~. Dream Fencing

Fencing is a famous Olympic
sport, which is also represented
in this game, but this version
adds some special moves and a
health bar, instead of relying
on points to determine the
winner. Here, the winner is the
character who first reduces the
opponent's health to zero, and
you'll be playing the event as a
small tournament where you have
to defeat two different
characters to achieve the best
possible position.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and buttons.

2. Use left and right (or "Y"
   and "A") to move your
   character, and you can
   double-tap those keys in
   order to give a quick step.
   In order to attack, simply
   slide your stylus towards the
   opponent, but be aware that
   you can also slide your
   stylus up, which makes your
   character parry the attacks
   of your opponent, which
   shortly stuns him and leaves
   him open for a free attack.

3. When one of your special
   meters is filled, you can
   slide your stylus down in
   order to launch your special
   attack, with its effect
   depending on who you're
   playing with, and if you do
   that next to the opponent's
   corner he may get throw out
   of the field, causing extra
   damage. You can also delay
   the attack by not lifting the
   stylus, after dragging it
   down.

"Dr. Eggman" and "Waluigi", due
to their stats and amazing
special moves, which are even
effective at long range, are
probably your best choices for
this event.



4.5.7~. Dream Shooting

Shooting, yet another event
included in the Olympic Games,
has a slightly different version
here. Instead of statically
hitting targets, you have to
visit three different areas and
shoot everything that crosses
your path, but try to make them
intelligent shots, instead of
mindlessly shooting at
everything. The winner is the
player who has more points in
the end of the event.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and buttons.

2. Move your crosshair by
   dragging your stylus across
   the lower screen, and shoot
   by pressing "L" (or "R").
   Keep track of the bullets you
   have left, and even if they
   are restored each time the
   characters change their
   position, you may want to
   manage them so that you
   always have bullets in the
   most important times of the
   event. Once you run out of
   shells, you can quickly drag
   the stylus from the left to
   the right side of the center
   of screen, and back, to
   reload your weapon.

3. Unusual enemies are worth
   more points than the robots
   that constantly come to the
   screen, and you should use
   them to get more points
   quickly. Hitting balloons
   also give you extra points,
   and doing so even ables you
   to steal points from your
   opponents, if you hit
   balloons which are somebody
   else's. Another way of
   getting more points is
   performing combos, which is
   done by scoring consecutive
   hits without ever missing a
   single shot.

4. As you progress across the
   three parts of the event,
   you'll see the usual item
   boxes. They always benefict
   your characters, and you
   should look for mushrooms
   (increase the size of your
   crosshair), stars (give you
   limitless ammo for a short
   amount of time), bombs
   (explode, giving damage to
   everything in its
   surroundings) and balloons
   (double the power of your
   shots).

Characters with a lot of power,
such as "Bowser" or "Knuckles",
end up being good choices for
this event, but "Tails" also
appears to work just fine.



4.5.8~. Dream Basketball

The actual sport isn't included
in this game, and therefore fans
will have to keep themselves
busy with this smaller version.
Instead of running across the
field and all that, you simply
have throw balls onto baskets,
and the winner will be the
player who has more points when
time runs out, but only those
records achieved when you set
the time to 90 seconds (press
"Set Rules" before the event to
change that) will actually be
saved.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. When you see a ball coming in
   your direction, touch it with
   your stylus in order for your
   character to grab it. Next,
   slide the stylus upward (the
   lenght of your slide controls
   the strenght), in the
   direction you want to throw
   the ball in. If you manage to
   get a single ball inside
   multiple baskets, which you
   can do when they cross each
   other's paths, you'll get
   extra points.

3. Once in a while, you may see
   some balls that come with a
   sticker. Those are items, and
   grant you special effects -
   there's a mushroom (makes the
   baskets bigger for a while),
   a star (you'll receive more
   golden balls), an emerald
   (speeds opponent's baskets
   and summons a "Boo", which
   makes it impossible for an
   opponent to score in a
   particular basket) and a
   balloon (aligns all the
   baskets for a short amount of
   time). You may also see
   golden balls, which simply
   triple the number of points
   you get from them.

All characters seem to be good
at this sort of event, but
"Tails" and "Yoshi" are actually
better than the average, for
some unknown reason.



4.6~. Table Tennis

If special attacks just aren't
for you, this option allows you
to play the real Table Tennis.
You may have seen something that
resembles this game somewhere
else, but let's pretend you
didn't know that, shall we?
Usually, the winning condition
for this event is that the first
character to reach 5 points
wins, but if they are tied by
then, you'll need to achieve a
two-point difference to win.
Also, you'll be playing the
event as a small tournament,
where you have to defeat two
different characters in order to
achieve the best possible
position.

1. This event is played by using
   buttons ONLY.

2. Start by tossing the ball,
   which you can do by pressing
   "A" (or either "B" and "Y").
   Next, you can move left and
   right by pressing those very
   same keys, and when you and
   your opponent are returning
   the ball to each other, each
   of the controls stated above
   perform a different kind of
   shot - "A" spins the ball
   right, "B" performs a
   straight hit (by correctly
   timing it, you'll do a fast
   smash shot) and "Y" spins the
   ball left. Also, you can
   change the direction of the
   ball by pressing left (or
   right) while you are
   returning it.

"Tails" and "Waluigi", due to
their high skill, are probably
the best characters you can take
for this event.



4.7~. Fencing

Fans of the classical Fencing
will probably prefer to play
this version of the event, since
it doesn't have any special
moves. Also, it follows the
classical, point-based, idea of
the modality, which requires a
lot more strategy than its
"Dream" version. The first
character to score 10 points is
the winner, and you'll be
playing the event as a small
tournament, where you have to
defeat two different characters
to achieve the best possible
position.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus and buttons.

2. Use left and right (or "Y"
   and "A") to move your
   character, and you can
   double-tap those keys in
   order to give a quick step.
   In order to attack, simply
   slide your stylus towards the
   opponent, but be aware that
   you can also slide your
   stylus up, which makes your
   character parry the attacks
   of your opponent, which
   shortly stuns him and leaves
   him open for a free attack.

"Luigi" and "Peach", with a lot
of skill and fair speed, are
probably the best choices for
this event.



4.8~. Shooting

More truthful to the actual
sport than its "Dream" version,
here you just have to try
hitting as many of the flying
targets as possible, and you win
one point for each hit. You
can't reload your weapon, so
you'll have to try hitting each
target with a single bullet. In
the end, the character who has
the most points wins.

1. This event is played by using
   the stylus ONLY.

2. As soon as the event starts,
   call for targets by pressing
   "A", tapping the lower screen
   or simply yelling to the
   console. This is usually
   unnecessary, but in case you
   tie with another character
   the time you took to do this
   is actually the tie-breaker.

3. Move your crosshair by
   dragging your stylus across
   the lower screen, and shoot
   by pressing "L" (or "R"), but
   be aware you can only spend a
   single bullet on each target,
   since you can't reload your
   weapon.

4. When your crosshair is on top
   of a target, it will turn
   yellow. When you see that,
   quickly shoot and you'll
   destroy the target. Repeat
   for every target across the
   eight different stations.

All-around characters, such as
"Mario" or "Luigi", seem just
fine for this event, but
"Shadow" also works fine.



4.9~. Cycling

Cycling mostly works as a race,
but with a fine twist. The
winning condition is obviously
being the first to cross the
finish line, and you will be
playing the event as a small
tournament, where you have to
defeat two different characters
to achieve the best possible
position.

1. This event is played by using
   buttons ONLY.

2. When you see the word
   "Ready?" on the upper screen,
   hold "L" and "R" to build up
   some power. A few seconds
   later, when "Go!" is seen in
   that very same place, quickly
   release those two buttons to
   have a quick take off.

3. Alternate between "L" and "R"
   to pedal, just like you would
   do on a real bike. While
   doing so, you can press left
   and right on the control pad
   to change your course. Be
   aware that the faster you
   pedal the quicker you will
   run out of stamina, and
   therefore you should be
   specially careful with the
   bar seen in the upper left
   corner of the upper screen,
   which shows your current
   speed. If it is shown as
   between the yellow line and
   the end of the bar, it will
   mean that you're losing
   stamina, which you can check
   in the small heart seen next
   to your character - in order
   to regenerate it, simply
   pedal slower or collect the
   heart-shaped items placed
   along the track.

4. If you're running below your
   opponent, be aware that you
   can move behind his current
   position to win some extra
   speed and stop you from
   spending any stamina.

Picking the best character for
this event depends on how you
decide to take it. You can
either go for a fast character
("Sonic", for example), one who
has plenty of stamina, such as
"Wario", or one who has both
those areas balanced, such as
"Knuckles" - it is really up to
you.



FAQ. Frequently Asked Questions

Some of the questions you,
readers, may have.

Q: How can Mario run as fast as
Sonic?

A: I haven't go a clue on that
one, sorry.


Q: Is there any way to play
online, against other people who
have this
   game?

A: No, there isn't. The closest
thing that this game has to
offer is the
   "Nintendo WFC Rankings"
   option, which allows you to
   compare your own records with
   those of other players from
   all over the world.


Q: You're mentioning an event
which I don't have. How do I
unlock [insert
   event here]?

A: Simply play across the entire
"Circuit" mode, and sooner or
later you
   will unlock all the events
   this game has to offer.


Q: This mission is way too hard,
can't you help me?

A: Apart from the tips mentioned
above, there's not much else I
can tell
   you, sorry. Also, be aware
   that some missions are
   frustratingly hard, and even
   I have some trouble facing
   them.


Q: What is the difference
between normal medals and those
acquired from
   "Dream" events?

A: While normal medals respect
the rules of the Olympic Games,
and come as
   gold, silver and bronze, the
   ones you get from "Dream"
   events have rankings instead,
   1st, 2nd and 3rd.


That's all for now...
