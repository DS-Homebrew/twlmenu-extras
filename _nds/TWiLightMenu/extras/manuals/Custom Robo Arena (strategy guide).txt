Custom Robo is one of the most
popular games in the world.
Although the premise at first is
simple, strategies and gameplay
have much more underlying
difficulty than first meets the
eye. This guide will assist you
in your goal to become one of
the Custom Robo Arena Champions.

This guide is spilt into 4
sections:

..Combos..

All right, the problem here is
that the whole "combo" thing is
somewhat confusing to
understand.

All you have to do is hit them
before the "HIT" message on
their status bar disappears.
This means that you can actually
afford some time to set up
attack chains before you
actually start downing them.

The combo damage itself lasts
from when you first damage them
(HIT message) until they re-
birth after being downed.

You need to use at least 3
different weapons, but not
necessarily limited to using
them one time each.

Aerial and ground gun shots
count separately toward the 3
weapons, but I am not sure
whether aerial bomb/pod fire is
different.

You have 3 hits of regular
damage before they are knocked
down, and after that, their
damage taken is greatly reduced.
(60-70 percent) Therefore, you
want to do them the majority of
the damage all at once and not
have to rely on your gun hitting
them while they are downed. You
want to hit them the hardest at
the start before they get
downed, then hit them quickly
before they rebirth.

-A quick example of this would
 be with the Needle Gun, Burrow
 Bomb P and the
Umbrella pod. This combo
probably won't get over 380, but
it will give you an idea of how
to set combos up.

1]Hit them with the Needle gun,
stopping their movement and
drawing them in toward you.
2]Launch a Bomb into the ground
in front of them and then hit
them with the Needle again,
downing them and blasting them
into the air with the Pillar
type blast. 3]Launch the
Umbrella pod while they are in
the air 4]Use the charge attack
to tack on some extra damage.

As you can see, it's all about
moving them into your traps,
then piling on the damage.

..Weapon Limits..

There is a set limit to how many
of a weapon you can have in the
field at once; once this limit
is met, you will have to wait
until there is sufficient spaces
for you to use new ones.

Gun- 10 individual rounds Bomb-
4 bombs (unknown if Dual bombs
count for 2) Pod- 3 individual
pods

Once there are enough places,
you are able to re-fire the
parts even though not all of
them have disappeared. You can
observe these limits with the
Volcanic bomb or Divide pod.
Both use more than one unit at a
time and use one less than the
limit. However, if one of the
units explodes, you are able to
fire once again. Thus you can
have 4 volcanic bombs and 3
Divide pod units on the field at
once.


..Critical hits: The optimal
range..

Some guns have a "sweet spot" or
range where they do the most
damage at. At this range, the
majority of the shots hit the
other robo and rack up the most
damage. Experimentation is
needed to find out what the
optimal range is.

The critical hit ranges for all
the guns can be seen in the
Parts list/Damage chart below.

*All damages were calculated
 with the Ray Mk III against the
 training robo/Ray
Mk III in the Free Play mode;
presumably they are the same
robo. Keep in mind that these
figures are just guidelines for
approximating damage. Multi-hit
guns are espcially difficult to
calculate max damages for
because of the multiple rounds
that often deal more damage at a
certain distance. Ie: not at
point blank


..Part Letters and their
effects..

You'll notice that some parts
have letters placed after their
names. ie: Burrow P/Satellite H

These letters denote the effect
of the blast. It is much easier
to find a bomb/pod that has the
right blast type for your set-
ups if you know the meanings of
all the letter types.

Letter Names and their effects:

Normal (no letter)-diagonally
upward (orange/red blast) Gazer-
upward (small weak blast)
Horizon-slowly to the side
(large white blast) Burst-blasts
sideways (medium pink blast)
Destroy-diagonally upward (skull
blast) Stun-paralyzes foe (small
green blast) Pillar-upward;
leaves a blast zone (tall orange
blast) Flipper-knocks foe to the
side (light blue pillar)
Cyclone- slowly upward (large
blue blast) Traction- toward
robo that fired the bomb/pod
(small yellow blast) Knockdown-
Knocks opponent down (medium
size brown blast) X (Explosion)-
Diagonally upward high into the
air (small brown white blast)


..Robo Special Abilitiies..

As alluded to in the notes
section, some/all robos have a
secret ability that is not
mentioned in the
manual/customization screen. The
game itself only mentions three
of them; the rest are apparently
for players to discover on their
own.

Shining Fighter "Better
intergration" with lag parts
gives them better mobility than
other robos with similar parts.
Has a descending air dash which
reduces lag.

Metal Grappler Less DOWN time
than other robos and better
reload rate.

Little Raiders Traction is
similar to the effect from
formula legs. Incredibly low
endurance makes them down from
most attacks.


Little Sprinters Traction is
similar to the effect from
Stabilizer legs. Incredibly low
endurance makes them down from
most attacks.

Javelin Unlimited quick charges
at the expense of invincibility

Jameson Cannot be downed by any
weapon or charge, as well is
invulnerable to blast effects
from weapons or charges.

Lightning Sky Has a unique long
range single air-dash; also has
a descending air dash which
reduces lag-time.

Ray Sky Shining Fighter mobility
and less down time. Also has
somewhat less vulnerability
after a dash.

---
For robo special abilities, wild
soldiers DON'T recover faster
after shooting. Creators made a
mistake.

Big Boys recover faster from
shots.

Strike vanishers have shorter
down time.

Burning beast have instant
recovery when landing

The rest of the abilities are
unknown at this point; as soon
as more information becomes
available it will be added, with
due credit.



2} ________-Techniques-
___________ A compilation of all
current accepted Custom Robo
Techniques

-Movement Techs-

.Short Hop- Pretty much a given,
but when you have Ground,
Feather or Quick Jumps on (or
Burning Beasts) you can
repeatedly jump back and forth
low to the ground to get a quick
burst of speed similar to an air
dash. Big Boys can demonstrate
this technique the best.

.Jump cancelling- When you jump
and fire a weapon from the air,
all movement stops and you can
take advantage of the gun/bomb's
aerial effects without having to
jump as high. You also cancel
the slide shot effect, making it
easier for you to avoid guns
like the V-Laser.

.Air-dash- The air dash is
mainly used to traverse long
distances quickly without the
danger of being exposed to enemy
fire. It can also be used to
approach quickly. By tapping A
twice near to the ground, you
can dash lower to the ground,
therefore reducing your
vulnerability upon landing. [See
Stealthdash]

.Continuous jump- The
counterpart to the air-dash.
Although less useful for moving
quickly, it is better for
dodging fire because you are not
left on the ground after using
it. Time your jumps so that you
jump right before the rounds are
about to hit you.

.Wall dash- If you jump while
moving alongside a wall, your
airspeed will be significantly
higher than if you had just been
moving in mid-air and you will
land farther away. You can
really see this the best with
Little Sprinters and Sassy
Stunners with the Wide Jump
legs. In most arenas you can
jump across an entire wall
without having to use a mid-air
jump.

.Stealth dash- Strike Vanishers
and Burning beasts have this
special kind of air-dash which
allows them to disappear while
they are dashing.

.Prep Spin- You can keep
yourself ready to run in any
direction (especially
stabilizer) by running in a
circle. That way, you will be at
top speed and ready to go in any
direction while you wait for
your opponent to rebirth.

-Gun Techs-

.Overloading- When you and
another robo fire your gun at
the same time, if one robo is
downed, the other robo's rounds
disappear. Try to overload robos
whose gun take a long time to
reach their opponent or stall in
the air.
*NOTE: Only Gun shots overload.
 Bomb and pod explosions do not.

.Slide shot- When running, you
can fire your gun and slide in
the direction you were running.
Use this technique to fire into
an open area and then come to a
stop behind a wall.

.Critical hit- Many guns have a
range at which they will do the
maximum damage. For example, the
Halo gun's aerial shot actually
does the most damage when used
point blank. (150 dmg) .Switch
Firing- Some guns/bombs shoot
differently from the air than on
the ground. Fire during a Jump
cancel with a gun or bomb to
switch the round type. Bombs
usually fire straight when fired
from the air, allowing them to
be used akin to a gun (doing
damage by hitting the robo
instead of the robo being caught
in the blast)

Switch firing also can be used
at the end of some charges
because of the slight vertical
distance gained during the
charge. An example of this is
Swift or Pike; both use their
aerial shots after a charge.


-Bomb Techs-

.Switch Firing- See Switch
firing in the gun section above

.Soft landing: You know how when
you dash twice (or more) in the
air and you have that lag when
you land if you're not wearing
reduced vulnerability legs? You
can cut that out with this.
After your dashes (or whenever,
really, if you're expecting lag
when landing) Prepare to fire
your bomb and hold it out until
your robo lands. Then, fire, and
your robo will be ready to go a
lot quicker than if you hadn't
done that. Tips to streamline
the process is to practice
starting the trick just before
you land, so you're not in one
spot for too long.

.Drifting: When you prepare to
fire a bomb from the air, you
drift slowly downward. You know
this already, but maybe not how
to apply it. You can dodge your
enemy's gun if it has low homing
and get a nice counterattack by
manipulating your drift and
letting go to dodge it.

.Stop on a Dime: You will stop
immediately on the ground (and
in the air if you're not a
dashing LS) when you're firing a
bomb. Use that if you've got
poor turning/braking and don't
have enough time to take a
detour away from running into an
explosion.

.Keep moving! : If you want to
launch your bombs from the air
and still be on the move, but
you don't wanna give in and use
a Lightning Sky? Try practicing
this: Since bombs have no lag
after they're fired, dash
immediately afterwards. This is
pretty brainless, but sometimes
it needs to be said.

-Pod techs-

.Neutral Pod- When no button is
pressed, pods go directly at
your opponent, giving you more
precise aim for cornering pods.



-Special Techs-

.Charge attack- All robos have a
charge attack, which is a close
range dash designed to allow you
to simultaneously negate damage
and cause damage. Using a charge
attack always downs the
opponent. Robos also have
different types of charges with
differing effects as well. Its
effect is shown next to its
section on the customization
screen.

Attack- usually moves in a
straight line and hits opponent
either slightly ahead of you or
into the air, away from your
position. Movement- used for
moving closer to the opponent
without taking damage. Effect on
opponent varies, Evasion- used
for avoiding damage while
remaining able to damage enemies
up close. Knocks enemies away.
Flak- used to hit mid-air
enemies. Hits opponents up
higher into the air. Also able
to be used to jump into the air
or over obstacles safely.


.Combos- Combos refer to an
unavoidable attack sequence that
happens in a short amount of
time. Refer to the "combo" guide
in the information section for
more info.

.Rebirth invincibility- after
being downed, there is a short
period of time called the
"rebirth" where your robo is
invulnerable to damage. The
Acrobat bomb/pods exploit this
feature and the Little
Raider/Sprinter's low endurance
stat to give them temporary
invicibility. By downing
themselves behind walls, they
are able to attack without fear
of being damaged.

.Charge shielding- Even if you
launch a bomb right next to an
opponent, there is still a
nanosecond where you can still
move. To add on some damage
really quick at close range,
bomb and then charge right
after. Often, just a simple
combo like this will net 150+
damage because single bombs
don't usually down robos.

.Prep Spin- You can keep
yourself ready to run in any
direction (especially formula)
by running in a circle. That
way, you will be at top speed
and ready to go in any direction
while you wait for your opponent
to rebirth.

.Reload Tech- When you are hit
by an attack, your gun will stop
firing and you will regain
movement. This effect is often
ignored because of wifi's lag,
but you can still you this to
your advantage. The acrobat bomb
counts as a hit since it takes
away some of your endurance. If
you launch a bomb ahead of your
path and then hit it while
firing your gun, you will fire
the shot while having your
reload vulnerability reduced. To
use this in the air, jump, fire
a bomb and then fire your gun so
that you drift onto the
explosion. On the ground, fire
it ahead of you and use your
slide shot to drift onto the
explosion.

."Check"- keeping a constant
threat on your opponent is
extremely helpful when playing
competitively. Robo sets that
can use the bomb pod and gun as
well as the charge to threaten
and eventually trap the other
robo are the most successful.

.D'Glitch- When a bomb or pod
happens to hit a robo at the
exact same time that a charge
hits, the robo will not down;
instead the robo will
miraculously emerge undowned.
This can either be a blessing or
a curse; not downing means that
the robo does not gain the 70%
damage buffer, but it also may
be able to counter attack.

3} ________Online
Strategies________

.Picking your stage: You want to
make sure that the stage you
pick corresponds to the robo you
plan on using and what robo your
opponent is using. You can get a
hint of what they use most by
paying attention their title
when your opponent is announced.
Titles like "the sparkling"
indicate that their most used
robo is a Shining Fighter like
the Ray MkII , while the title
"Get off my Lawn" shows that
they favor Old-Timer robos such
as Codger or Gramps.

You can check Killbot's "Title
Research thread" to find the
current list of title
descriptions. However, there is
no real way to determine what
the titles truly represent or
what the conditions are for
obtaining them.

.Customizing your robo: Make
sure that your choices are
specialized for the stage that
you picked. Don't be afraid to
change up a few parts from your
saved sets to match what robos
you anticipate your foe using.
Also, try not to be predictable
with your choices. If you never
change your parts, you will
eventually find yourself unable
to counter anything once your
opponent figures out how to beat
you.

.The robo cannon- the virtual
starting block: Unless you have
a strong, close- range gun, try
to fire away from the action,
behind a wall or some barrier.
This gives you less of a chance
of starting the game off already
behind in points. Try not to
have your cube bounce around too
much; it delays your unfolding.
You will notice that some places
will guarantee opening quicker
in most situations/robo sizes.
Try to remember where these are,
because it will often mean
losing 200+ hp because your
opponent has the opportunity to
use a perfect combo on you.

.Opening moves: What you should
do first depends on each
individual set, but there are a
couple guidelines. You should
always have an opening combo
worked out, even it just
involves your gun and your
charge. Don't lose the
opportunity to deal 150 damage
but waste it fumbling around.
Experiment in the training arena
to figure out a quick sequence.

If you are far away, you may opt
to just down them quickly with a
bomb and prepare your attack
while they are downed.

[[Countering strategies]]
Although there are seemingly
endless customizations of robos,
they eventually fall into a
generic strategy type.

.Melee/ Gun Spammer- The most
common type of strategy used to
by newer players, this strategy
focus almost completely on the
gun's high damage and homing to
KO opponents and the charge to
repeatedly hit opponents.

How to counter: Jump often while
dropping pods behind you and
using your slide shot to dash
away from them. As long as you
are in the air, you are for the
most part invulnerable to damage
except by their gun. Circle
around them as you approach to
negate their round's homing.
Also make use of your
surroundings to shield yourself.
Once you are close enough or
they are hit, quickly down them
and run away again.

.Long-Range Flyers

The second most common strategy
used on wi-fi is essentially the
same as the melee gunner's, but
they use their ability to fly
over obstacles and fire without
becoming vulnerable to distance
themselves from you.

How to counter: This is one of
the easiest traps to fall for.
Since they are able to fire high
power rounds that will down you
easily, you will be hard pressed
to win if you do not include at
least one anti-air weapon in
your customization. One of the
best ways to fit this in is a
gun that fires differently in
the air. By mixing your air and
ground shots, and you can keep
them stranded on the ground
where they are very slow. Also
try to go for an overload by
downing them quickly so that
their high powered shots will
disappear. Once they land, they
will be an easy target for you,
so keep on the move, firing only
behind walls and after they have
just fired until they land.
Using a Flak-type charge that
jumps into the air is also a
good foil as they will be
instantly downed and unable to
get away.

.Close Range Runners

This strategy uses either the
Little Raider/Sprinter models or
Shining Fighters to dodge fire
with their high speed. They then
attempt to trap you or stun you
before unleashing their gun on
you.

How to counter: Because their
speed is so high, the only time
when you will be able to use a
straight-firing gun is when they
are sliding or when they are
downed. The key to defeating
these robos is a customization
that emphasizes blocking tactics
to trap them in a corner or keep
them running around trying to
dodge your blasts. Pods are the
easiest way to block off paths
due to their unique ability to
fire in any direction and
without slowing down to fire.
Another good weapon to use is
the V-Laser; it's long range
blast shoots to the side and
forces them to jump into the air
to avoid your fire. Take
advantage of the Runner's
typically low endurance rating
and use weapons that can cause
many explosions all at once to
trap them and negate their gun
rounds.

.Chipper

These robos try to damage you
from afar using long range
weapons and chip away at your
health while you are unable to
approach them up close.
Sometimes one of the most
frustrating opponents because
they sometimes can simply stall
the match with time running out.

How to counter: This strategy is
a type favored by Aerial
Beatuies, Big Boys and Old-
Timers. Knowing this, the most
efficient way to win them is by
keeping them on the ground and
behind a wall where they are
slow, trapped and unable to
damage you. Flying pods do the
job best in these situations
because they do not overload.
Try to limit their range by
placing Satellites or Beast pods
in the corners or in a line
diagonally across the stage for
them to run into. Lastly, these
robos's gun rounds are usually
very easy to overload because of
their slower speed and reload
time. Since they are mainly
trying to trap you in a corner
and pummel you, stay in the open
and weave behind walls, forcing
them to avoid you instead of
firing their gun. Once they
land, they are an easier target.
A direct charge is a good choice
to down them; lag can make gun
rounds not disappear.

.Heavy Hitters

These robos try to outlast your
attacks with their high
endurance, then slam you with
massive amounts of damage before
retreating away.

How to counter: your main
objective is to keep them away
from you and unable to approach.
Once they are within range of a
charge attack, you are
defenseless and they can rack up
huge combos with little effort.
Instead of trying to challenge
them head on, try to pin them in
one place and do your damage all
at once so that the combined
effect of your weapons will be
enough to down them. Take
advantage of their high
endurance and juggle them
between blasts. On the whole,
their mobility is severely
limited if they cannot jump due
to their single air-dash. Keep
them from jumping, at a distance
and combo them once they are
trapped.

.Combo Robos These robos have a
specific combo that they are
designed to do. Often, they
combine several elements of the
aforementioned strategies but
are designed to take advantage
of a specific combo. The key
thing to defeating this style is
to understand what weapon begins
the combo and focus on avoiding
it so that you don't get sucked
into the rest of the weapons.


[[Strategies]]

.First off, always keep a mental
tally of your surroundings. By
remembering where your opponent
launched bombs and pods earlier,
you can avoid most simple traps
and make simple stationary traps
much less useful. Also related
to this skill is keeping track
of your opponent. Count how many
air-dashes/jumps your opponent
has taken so that you can
calculate when to rush in for an
attack. Keep special note if you
see that your opponent has Plus-
One legs- they can surprise you
with a last jump to dodge your
attack and hit you when you are
most vulnerable.

.Predict where your opponent
will move to next and make
subtle changes to your attack so
that you will be ready for when
they try to bolt away. Likewise,
learn how to spot a trap coming
and move to another place to
keep from being cornered.

.Keep yourself protected. There
are no shields aside from
charges, so you will have to
rely on your jumps and on your
environment to prevent losing
health. If possible, end aerial
jumps/dashes behind walls and
end gun attacks by sliding
behind a wall.

.Find their pattern. Most sets
have a pattern of attacks.
Typically it progresses like
this:

POD BOMB GUN CHARGE

This is because each takes more
time to use than the ones before
it. By experience, you can
decipher the pattern of attacks
your opponent uses to trap you
and you will learn the steps you
need to take to evade the chain.
If you are realizing that your
opponent has learned how to
evade your attacks, it is time
to switch tactics. Stay in the
air/on the ground more. Use a
different gun mode. Launch your
bombs so that they are trapped
in the corners. Place bombs and
pods off-screen and run your
opponent into a blind trap. If
all else fails, focus on evading
their attacks so that you don't
take damage and let them make
mistakes. An expert commander
will be able to adapt to all
strategies with the set they
chose and formulate a counter…
and the sooner, the better.

.Keep your cool. This goes
without saying, but often in the
heat of battle, take a moment to
reflect on what technique they
are using successfully and
figure out how to get around it.

.Don't underestimate your
opponent. Often the sets you
have never seen before are the
ones you are most likely to make
big mistakes because you haven't
had much experience countering
it. In addition, make use of the
time that you are shown your
opponent's customization to make
a quick battle plan.

.Learn the timing of attacks,
reload times, bomb/pod blast
fading times and how long it
takes on average for your
opponent to get out of rebirth.
This will be incredibly helpful
for you because you can guess at
what is happening in the rest of
the stage without actually
seeing it happen. You can also
time attacks so that you are
attacking as long as possible
while your opponent is
vulnerable.

.Learn from experience. If your
opponent picked Seal Kid last
time you picked Nature Park, a
set made to counter it will most
likely succeed if you pick that
same stage again. Or, the
opposite could happen. You use a
set to counter their previous
set- and they pick a counter for
your counter! Over time, you can
try to predict what your
opponent will do in a given
situation. Also make an effort
to remember what sets they have
saved in their garage.
Commanders will rarely make a
totally new set on the spot
unless they are inexperienced
because they have more
experience with their regular
sets.

.When making sets, focus on how
all the parts work together, not
just a single combo or how well
the set takes over the field.
The key to success is a set that
combines damage potential,
evasiveness, control and
unpredictability into one single
set.

5-3-07: This concludes the end
of my research up to this point.
I hope that in addition to being
a reliable, credible source of
information, it will also be a
place where players can ask for
advice, give tips to others, and
serve as a showcase for worthy
guides. If you would like to
submit your guide for inclusion
in the useful links section,
kindly PM me the link and I will
be more than happy to feature
it.

6-26-07: I added a couple more
things to the Advanced
techniques and linked to one of
the Gamefaqs user's guides.

9-17-07 Version 2 includes a
totally new strategy section to
the wifi battles and has a
couple of newly discovered
techniques included as well. All
the previous NSider html has
been removed and two of the URLs
to my sources have unfortunately
both been broken since my last
revision of this, so I had to
remove them.

As always, I encourage readers
to point out mistakes,
inaccuracies or confusing
portions as well as discuss the
material and the evolving
strategy in Custom Robo's wifi
arena. I am a huge fan of this
game and hopefully by reading
this guide, some of the
enjoyment that I got out of
writing this guide will rub off
on you. ;)
