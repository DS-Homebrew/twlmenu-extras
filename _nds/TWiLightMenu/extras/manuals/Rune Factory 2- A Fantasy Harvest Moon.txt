********************************
1.1. Game Info                  
********************************

This game was released on
November 18th in the USA and it
is a sequel to the previous Rune
Factory - A Fantasy Harvest
Moon. The story of this game is
not directly connected to the
previous one, so even if you
didn't play the first you can
still enjoy this game the same
way.

For the ones who don't know
about this game, it's pretty
much the same as the previous
Harvest Moon series except that
now, besides taking care of a
farm you also need to explore
dungeons, fight monsters and
level up, that is, now some RPG
features were added to increase
the variety of tasks you can
perform.

Some improvements were made to
the previous controls, mainly
about the touch screen so it is
a bit more functional. A major
difference in this game to the
previous Rune Factory is that
now you're able to play with two
generations of characters
because, once you get married
and raise your baby, the main
focus of the game will be
transfered to your child, so
he'll have to take care of the
farm instead of his dad. It is
here that you can say the game
really shows everything it has,
since there are a lot of things
you couldn't do before and now
will be available.

If you think it is interesting
to take care of a farm and deal
with monsters and quests or if
you always liked Harvest Moon or
liked the previous Rune Factory,
you should really try this game.


********************************
1.2. About Authors [Authors]
********************************

Hello, we're Lerion and Winchu.
This is our first time writing a
FAQ, so if you see something
wrong or if you want to suggest
improvements, feel free to
contact us via email:
lerionfaqs@gmail.com

Even though the e-mail is on
Lerion's name, both of us can be
contacted by this account as
well as we both can also answer
the new mails.

We started writing this guide
for ourselves, since there was
none at the time and we needed
some data for later
consultation. But after start
writing it, we thought it would
be nice if we could share with
the others, so we started to
format it like a FAQ so we could
submit it later if possible.

We're not a native American or
anything so it's possible that
this guide contains some
misspelling / grammatical
mistakes, so we apologize. If
you see mistakes in this text
and want to help to correct them
you can also contact us to alert
about them.


********************************
1.3 Guide Info                  
********************************

The update has finally come, now
the guide covers both
generations and I can say it's
finished, except for some
possible mistakes there might be
or some improvements that can be
made later to enrich the guide
even more. I must say the second
part of the guide was mainly
(near totally) written by
Winchu, so all the credits for
this part must be given to him,
as all I did was to support him
a bit in the end and revise the
text before publishing.

The info displayed in this guide
was based in my, and my
collaborators, experience of the
game, so it's possible some
things will be missing, even
though we tried to cover
everything we found in the game.
If you see a hole or if
something said in this guide is
not correct you can also contact
me to alert me about it if you
want.

I wanted to make a guide easier
to read, visually speaking, so I
used different characters and
symbols for the header and the
tables, trying to make it easier
to identify each component. So,
just to make things clearer,
here's an explanation on the
notation and features of this
guide:

- Double reference: Both numbers
 each section, this way you can 
 the tag, what you think it's ea
 works better. By the way, when 
 make sure to include the bracke
- Symbols for headers: Each diff
 different symbol, so it's easie
 see the symbols surrounding the
 search different header level b
 even though the references shou
 identifiers for each header lev
- # for level 1 headers: for exa
 like this:
################################
X. Section Name [Section Tag]
################################

- * for level 2 headers: the sam
 by *
- = for level 3 headers: and fin
  and they're surrounded by =
- - for tables: tables are ident
 composed of -

Still speaking about the tables,
each even item has a line of .
(dots) connecting the columns.
That was made in order to try to
make easier to read, as I
usually get lost trying to
follow blank lines.

The ones who seek quick info
without details, can take a look
at the section "Quicklists"
where I created sections of some
things that can be interesting
to have a quick look sometimes
but are scattered in the middle
of a lot of text in the main
body of the guide.

Notice that tables that are
already "clean" in the main
sections are not in this
quicklist section, such as the
birthday, for example, because
that would be too redundant.

Well, that was based on my
thoughts so it might not be the
best at all, so if you think
something is wrong or could be
better, feel free to contact me
and make suggestions, they are
very welcome.

2. Game Basics [Basics]
################################

This section will cover the
basics of this game, hence the
title. Here I'll explain a bit
about the game commands, what
you can do and some of the main
changes I noticed from the first
game.


********************************
2.1. First Steps [Steps]
********************************

For the ones who not aware, this
game is basically a farm
simulator with some RPG-like
features, such as entering
dungeons, fighting and capturing
monsters.

Your main objectives in this
game will be to keep a good farm
and a good life. That is, you'll
have to keep an active farm,
growing crops, animals, etc.
while trying to be friends with
the villagers and eventually
getting married with one of the
girls available.

That said, I'll first explain a
bit about how you move around in
the game and do some tasks using
the controls. First I'll tell
about the basic controls and
then about how to use the touch
screen controls.


================================
2.1.1. Basic Controls [Controls]
================================

Here's what each button will do
once pressed and some
combination of buttons you need
to know. Notice that these
commands assume your using the
default button configuration of
the game. If you already changed
them in the Settings menu, just
invert the L and R buttons
explanation if you switched
them. The same applies to the
D-Pad and the ABXY buttons.

So here's the explanation:

- D-Pad: Move around

- Sort the browse menu: When you

================================
2.1.2. Touch Controls [Touch]
================================

Besides pressing the buttons,
you can also perform some tasks
by touching in the touch screen.
The functionalities were
improved over the first game, so
now you can do a lot of thing.
You can even play the game
completely by using only the
touch screen if you want, even
though I still prefer to use the
buttons in general.

Here's what you can do:

- Move around: Touch and hold an

********************************
2.2. Your House                 
********************************

In this section you'll know a
little more about your own
house. I'll try to give a brief
explanation about the furniture
you can interact with in your
place. You can interact with
them by getting close to one of
them and pressing the action
button or touching the screen.

I'll start from the one in the
upper left corner and proceed to
the right until the wall and
then I'll go back to the left
again and go down. So here's the
list:

First Floor
--------------------------------
Diary: Allows you to save the
game any time you want. Shelf:
You can store non-eatable items
you don't use frequently here.
Refrigerator: You can store food
and alike here. Chest: No use
for it yet. Only in the
beginning of the second
generation. The
    old tools from Kyle will be 
Fireplace: No use as well.
Bookshelf: Presents a tutorial
about fighting.


Second Floor
--------------------------------
Calendar: It's on the right
corner. Shows the calendar and
the festivals days.
    Also, every time someone tel
    here right away.
Mirror: It's on the vanity table
in the left bedroom. Allows you
to exchange
    items with other people eith
    (Wi-Fi Connection).
Double Bed: It's in the left
bedroom. Allows you to sleep and
call a day. This
    way you'll replenish your HP
    up on the next day.
Single Bed: It's on right
bedroom. Works the same way as
the Double Bed. Diary: Allows
you to save the game any time
you want.


********************************
2.3. Sleeping Time [Sleep]
********************************

The time you go to bed and sleep
affects your status the next
day. That is, only if you're an
extreme player. See below how
much of the total HP and RP you
restore and what else changes
depending on the time you sleep
(when I say "until time", I mean
not including that time, for
example, if I say "until AM
1:00", that means that'll happen
if you go to bed before AM 1:00
or until AM 12:59. If you go to
bed at AM 1:00 or AM 1:01 and so
on, it'll be the same as going
to bed until AM 2:00):

- Until AM 1:00: 100% HP & RP, d
- Until AM 2:00: 100% HP & RP, d
- Until AM 3:00: 80% HP & RP, do
- Until AM 4:00: 50% HP & RP, ge
- Until AM 5:00: 50% HP & RP, ge
- AM 5:00: The character automat
 wakes up at AM 10:00. If he's i

Ailments subsection in the
Fighting section.


********************************
2.4. Weather                    
********************************

It is important to know about
the weather when farming, as
these may affect your activities
of the day. Notice that even
though it doesn't seem so, the
dungeons are also affected by
weather changes. I'll present
some of the consequences of each
different weather below:

- Hurricane: You can't go out of
 destroys some of the crops you 
- Rainy: Changes the schedule of
 of the fields.
- Snow Storm:  The same as Hurri
- Snowy: The same as Rainy, but 
- Sunny: Usual weather, doesn't 

If you want to know about the
weather forecast for 1 day, you
can ask Alicia to tell you by
paying 10G. You can also ask her
to change the weather if, for
example, you know a hurricane
will come and you don't want it.
You can choose one of two
possible weathers: sunny (pay
100G in first generation and
200G in second) or rainy (1000G
in first and 2000G in second).


********************************
2.5. Lost and Found [Lost]
********************************

In the first floor of Byron's
(the mayor's) house you'll find
a box (in front of the entrance
door, in the wall) that will
hold any important item you
accidentally toss out. So, if
you ever throw away an
irreplaceable item, such as a
proposal item or anything like
that, you don't need to panic.
Just proceed to Byron's house
and check the box and most
likely the item will be there.
If not, that means you can
obtain it again by some other
way. Notice that if you lose a
quest item you don't need to
look for it in the Lost and
Found box, you can go to the
bulletin board, cancel the quest
and start it again.

3. Start Menu                   
################################

Here I'll explain a bit about
the info you can see in the
Start Menu (the one you can see
when you press the Start
button). There are six menus
listed in the top of the screen
as well as a close button at the
extreme right (the X icon). So
here's an explanation about each
of them:


********************************
3.1. Inventory/Status
     [Inventory]
********************************

The first menu you'll see when
you open the Start Menu. In this
one you can see the status of
your character in the upper
screen and his inventory in the
lower screen.

About the status: The left table
shows you from top to bottom:
the name of your character, his
level, the amount of experience
needed to level up again (this
bar fills up as you fight and
defeat monsters and, when it's
finally full you level up).
Below the "Next" bar there are
the HP and RP bars and your
money.

Concerning the HP bar: The HP
(Health Points) bar represents
your physical condition. This
bar will go down every time
you're hurt by a monster of when
you try to use a tool after you
have already depleted the RP
bar. If the HP bar empties
you'll faint and, if you're in
the village when that happens
you'll wake up on the clinic and
lose the day. On the other hand,
if that happens when you're in a
dungeon, there won't be anyone
around to rescue you when you
faint, so instead of being
carried over to the clinic
you'll actually die and you'll
have to load the game from where
you last saved it, so be
EXTREMELY careful about your HP
when you're inside a dungeon.
You can restore a bit of HP by
eating some grasses or crops, by
drinking a potion, by taking a
shower in the bathhouse of the
village, using spells or by
activating some special slabs in
the dungeons.

Concerning the RP bar: RP stands
to Rune Points. This bar
represents both your stamina and
your magical energy. Every time
you use a tool, swing a weapon
or use a Rune Ability this bar
will go down a bit. If you
deplete your RP you won't be
able to use Rune Abilities
anymore, but you'll still be
able to use tools and weapons
consuming the HP bar instead of
the RP one every time. To
restore RP, you need to collect
the runes generated by grown
crops (recover 50 RP) or the
flowers (recover 12 RP) and
crystals (recover 24 RP) in the
dungeons, eat some specific
foods or take a shower (recover
100 RP) in the bathhouse of the
village.

Well, let's go back to the upper
status screen, now I'll tell
about the right table: This
table shows the attribute values
of your character. These values
go up as you level up and they
affect mainly your fighting
(notice your total HP also grows
up as you level up, but the RP
is always the same).

The last thing about the upper
screen is a bar that I'll call
"Time Bar". This bar is the one
that is shown in this same place
when you're out of the Start
Menu. The Time Bar shows you
from left to right: The
currently year, season, day of
the month and of the week, the
time and lastly the weather.

Now let's turn our attention to
the lower screen, the inventory:
Again there are two tables. The
left one shows your equipped
stuff, that is, what you're
currently wearing or holding.
One item can be placed on each
of the boxes, but you cannot
place anything anywhere, each of
them only accepts proper items
for that place. So here's an
explanation about them:

The top square, the Held box,
holds the item you're currently
holding in your hands. So if you
just picked something up you
should see it in this box. The
same way, if you want to put
something in your hands, you can
just put it in this box.

Next comes the R. Hand (Right
Hand) box. This one will have
the current tool or weapon
you're holding, the one you can
use by pressing the tools
button.

The L. Hand (Left Hand) box is
where you'll be able to equip
shields to increase your defense
in battle. This is a passive
slot, you can't actually use it
for anything. All you need to do
is to equip it here and receive
the benefits it gives (shield
defense only applies when you're
equipped with a shortsword or a
rod).

The Rune Abl. (Rune Abilities)
has two boxes, meaning you can
equip up to two different Rune
Abilities at the same time. The
one placed in the left box can
be activated by pressing the
first Rune Ability button (Y
button or Left in the D-Pad if
you changed controls) and the in
the right box is activated by
pressing the second Rune Ability
button (X button or Up in the
D-Pad).

The last two boxes are the
accessories you can equip to
receive some bonuses. You can
equip up to two of them and the
bonus given by each accessory
may vary a lot, it can be, for
example: increase defense,
increase resistance to an
attribute, increase status, etc.

Finally, the right table of the
lower (touch) screen shows your
backpack. There are 45 slots
available and each of them can
hold up to 9 units of the same
(notice that they must be of the
same level as well, if you have,
for example, a level 1 Onion and
a level 2 one you can't place
both of them in the same slot).


********************************
3.2. Skill                      
********************************

This menu shows the skill levels
of your character, that is, his
ability level at some specifics
tasks. You can increase your
skill levels by actually
performing the action that
benefits from that skill level,
for example, the Weapons Skill
affects the RP consumption when
fighting, so, if you want to
increase the Weapons Skill level
you need to actually fight with
a weapon. Increasing the skill
levels allows you to receive
some benefits when doing
something that depends on that
skill. In general most of them
decreases the amount of RP you
need to perform an action that
depends on that skill. If that
is not the case, I'll tell in
the description of that skill
what it does instead. Here's a
list of what is affected by each
skill and additional effects
they can have on actions:

- Weapons: This skill is also af
 try to fight with a weapon whos
 you'll consume more RP than the
- Farming: Affects the using of 
- Mining: Affects the using of h
- Pharmacy: Affects the success 
 own. The best medicines require

- Accessories: The same as Pharm
- Camping: Affects the use of sl
- Magic: Affects the use of Rune
- Logging: Affects the use of ax
- Fishing: Affects the use of po
- Forging: The same as Pharmacy,
- Cooking: The same as Pharmacy,
- Communication: Affects the tam


********************************
3.3. Accompanying Monster
     [Accompany]
********************************

Here you'll be able to see the
status of the monster that's
accompanying you at the time, if
any. The lower screen will show
a 3D picture of the monster and
the upper one will shows its
status. Let's see a bit about
the status screen.

There are three windows in this
screen. The top one shows an
icon of the monster, its name on
the right and its current HP
below.

The middle window says the
species of the monster and
displays 10 balls that represent
your Friendship Level with that
monster. As you feed and brush
it everyday you'll increase the
Friendship Level and, by doing
so, you increase its fighting
status as well as its produces
qualities, if it's a Produce-
Type monster.

The last window shows a
description about the monster as
well as its Skill (kind of
attack when battles) and its
attribute (affects the damage
dealt / taken from other
attribute monsters).


********************************
3.4. Friendship [Friendship]
********************************

Display the villagers you know
and their Friendship Level
towards you (maximum 10). The
main list in the lower part
shows the name of the villager,
the Friendship Level of this
villager and the Love Level
(this one only appears for some
specific villagers that you can
engage). Besides the main list,
there are also 5 buttons just
above it that allows you to
change the list view. I'll tell
a bit about them:

From left to right, the first
button (a girl face) allows you
to see the Friendship Level of
the villagers. The second button
(a monster face) allows you to
see the Friendship Level of the
monsters you tamed.

The three button on the right,
instead of change the elements
of the list, allows you to sort
the list by some property.
Notice that when you click the
sorting button once, it'll sort
the name in ascending order (the
button will be pointing
upwards), but if you click this
button once again, the names
will be sorted in descending
order (pointing downwards).

About these three buttons: The
first one (Auto) sorts the names
in a way defined by the game (I
think it's by first meeting
order, but I'm not sure). The
second button (a smile face)
sorts the names by friendship
level. The last button (heart)
sorts the names by love level.


********************************
3.5. Plot Items                 
********************************

This menu shows you the plot
items you already got in the
game. There should be 32 of them
and you can get them by
advancing in the game, but
they'll only become available on
the second generation part of
the game. Those items are
important to proceed the main
plot of the game, but you don't
need to take much care of them
because they don't have any
effect on your character, just
check to know what is missing to
complete your objectives. This
is the list of them:

- Ancient Manuscript;
- Spring Orb;
- Summer Orb;
- Fall Orb;

as soon as you advance to the
second generation) and Omni-Gate
(check Magic Books section), all
other plots item can be gotten
after you complete some
requirements to the statues in
all dungeons or defeat a boss,
so check the Dungeons section
for further informations.


********************************
3.6. Settings [Settings]
********************************

Shows what you can configure in
the game, to make it fit you
better. There are only three
options:

If you want your changes to take
effect you need to hit the Save
button in the lower part of the
screen before going out of the
menu. If you make any changes
but didn't like the results,
just hit the Reset button and
the default configuration will
take place.


################################
4. Farming                      
################################

This is the main part of the
game. So first I'll present a
simple tutorial on what should
you do when you start farming.

First of all you need to clear a
small area in your farming field
outside your house. Notice there
are lines on the ground
delimiting 3x3 squares, so try
to clear one of them. If you
still don't have a hammer to
break the big rocks or an axe to
cut the tree stumps, simply pick
and toss the grasses, small
rocks and wooden branches, this
way they'll disappear then you
toss them out and you'll clean a
part of your field.

After doing this, select your
hoe and start tilling the land
you just cleaned, this way
you'll be preparing the field to
plant some seeds on it.

Now select some seeds from your
backpack (if you don't have any,
you can buy them at the general
store or try earn some as a
quest reward or anything), place
yourself in the middle of the
3x3 you tilled and spread the
seeds by pressing the tools
buttons again.

If done correctly, the 9 tilled
soils will have some dots on
them, showing the seeds are
planted. Finally, select your
watering can, refill it if
needed (in the watering pond
near your house) and start
watering all of the seeds on the
ground.

That's it. Now all you have to
do is to water them everyday
until they grow and you can
harvest them to earn some money
and start everything again.

Before someone asks me I'll say
this: even if you forget to
water the crops a day they won't
die, they'll just take a little
longer (1 day in this case) to
grow, so rest at ease.

You can sell your harvested
crops or any valuable item you
want to sell by tossing them in
your shipping box in your farm
(the box just below the water
pond next to your house). Mana
will at PM 3:00 to get the items
from the box and pay you for
them (you don't need to be
around to receive the money). If
you put anything in the box
after PM 3:00, Mana will only
pick and pay for them in the
next day.

After these basics about
farming, I'll tell a bit about
the role of the shipping box
(other than selling), the
farming tools available and
later about the crops you can
grow in the game.


********************************
4.1. The Shipping Box [Shipping]
********************************

Other than selling the items you
throw inside of it, the Shipping
Box also shows you how many of
the possible items you already
sold and how much you earned for
each of them, as well as some
general info about the farm. To
see this info, approach the box
and press the action button or
touch it.

A new menu will open when you do
this. In the lower screen you'll
see a list of the items you
already sold and how much you
earned by selling them until
now. In the upper part of this
screen there are six icons you
can select to change the kind of
items of the list. From left to
right the icons represent:

- Crop Records: Shows info about
 collect from farming soil (gras
- Medicine Records: Info about t
 pharmacies on you own in the se
- Accessory Records: Info about 
 you can only craft them on your
- Cooking Records: Info about th
 able to cook in the second gene
- Fish Records: Info about the f
- Other Records: Info about the 

You can sort the lists in the
same way as you could do in the
Friendship menu (see the Start
Menu section above for more
info).

In the upper screen you can see,
besides the usual description of
the selected item in the lower
part, two tables in the top. The
left table is always fixed, that
is, it doesn't change when you
select another list in the lower
screen. This table shows general
info about your farm: its name,
how much you earned until the
moment (not how much you have,
but the total amount collected
by selling goods without
considering the spendings), the
percentage of the total of
different kinds of items you
already sold at least once and
how much wood and monster feed
you have available.

The right table shows info about
the current list you're looking
at the lower screen. It
contains, the name of the list,
how much you earned until the
moment by selling this kind of
good, the percentage of the
total of that kind of good you
already sold at least once and
finally what item gave the
highest and the lowest income.


********************************
4.2. Farming Tools [Tools]
********************************

In this game, in the first
generation your tools will
already a bit improved, so
you'll be able to use until
level 2 charge from the
beginning.

For the ones who never played a
Harvest Moon game before or
don't know what charge means,
I'll explain about it.

Any tool can be used in
different levels of intensity so
it'll have a different level of
effect when activated. Each of
these levels is what we call a
charge. A level 0 charge is the
standard action you perform when
you simply press the tools
button. If you want to use a
level 1 charge, press and hold
the tools button for a while. If
you do this, you'll see a blue
sphere around the tool you're
using. If you release the button
at this time, the effect of the
tool will be amplified, but
notice you'll also lose more
Rune Point after the action. To
perform a level 2 charge, do the
same as the level 1 charge,
press and hold the tools button.
After a while, the blue sphere
will appear again, but if you do
not release the tools button
just yet and hold it for a
little longer, the sphere will
become purple. Now, if you
release the button during the
purple sphere stage you'll be
able to perform a level 2
charge, that's even more
powerful and also depletes more
of your RP. Notice that, when
using a tool on farming soil,
the area the tool will affect is
marked in red. Most of the time
it'll be a single square, but,
when you charge the hoe or the
watering can, the area will
increase, meaning that, when you
release the charge you'll till
or water, respectively, all of
that area.

Notice that in the first
generation part, the tools will
only be able to charge from
level 0 to level 2, but in the
second generation part of the
game you'll be able to obtain
tools that have even more
charging levels. To activate
them, do the same proceeding,
but hold the button for even
more time and the sphere should
change again, showing that
you'll perform a more powerful
charge.

Also don't forget that once you
enter the second generation part
of the game, all the farming
tools will be rusted. That means
that, besides only being able to
perform a level 0 charge, the
axe and hammer tools won't
cut/break stumps and big rocks
no matter how many times you try
to do destroy them. If you want
to improve your tools, you'll
need to upgrade them in the
Workshop (see Tools Upgrades in
the Forging section for
details).

Below you'll be able to see some
general info about the farming
tools and the effect of the
charge level for each item.

* Second generation only.

********************************
4.3. Crops                      
********************************

In this section you'll find out
about the crops you can plant
and sell to earn some money and
keep your farm. The crops are
organized by the season you can
plant them in. For each of the
crops (or seeds of these crops)
I'll list the seed price at the
general store, how much the seed
is worth for selling (only after
you get the seed maker in the
2nd generation), the crop value
for selling and its growth and
regrowth time.

Also some special seeds can be
only get in second generation
after you find the vegetable
with Inquisitive Waltz in
dungeons and use the Seed Maker
at Alvarna Academy - Workshop.
These seeds will be marked with
* and a small note about where
to find this item will be
available at the table's end.

Now this is something I wanted
to say, but I didn't know
exactly where to place it, so
I'll put it here. Pay attention
when you try to chop the grass
(if you planted it, that is),
because if you accidentally chop
it twice before it regrows,
you'll actually be killing it
and it'll never grow up again,
unless you plant new seeds.

5. Crafting                     
################################

In this section you'll know
about the items you can create
by yourself, either weapons,
tools improvements, cookings and
etc.

Before you start crafting, you
need first to upgrade the
school, asking the mayor to
build the workshop extension.
After it's built, it'll be only
an empty room and you won't be
able to do anything until you
buy from Yue (choose "I want a
bargain.") the proper tools to
start the work (The tools you
need are listed in each
section). Notice Yue doesn't
sell all the items everyday,
each day of the week she'll be
selling a different tool for
crafting, so make sure to go in
the correct date to obtain the
tool (The days of the week are
also mentioned in each section).

You won't be able to craft any
item you want so easily, unless
you have the necessary skill
level to do so. But notice that
even if your skill level is
lower than the minimum skill
level required, you can still
try to craft the item, but
you'll have a lower success rate
of getting a good result. Except
for the cookings, every time you
failure at crafting something
you'll only lose some RP (you
always lose RP when crafting,
even if you get a success) and
you won't obtain any item in the
process (you won't lose the
items you used to try to create
the new item). For cookings this
doesn't apply, as if you try to
cook anything and if it isn't a
success you'll get a "Failed
Dish" as a result and WILL lose
the items you used, so be
careful when cooking.

The success rate when crafting
follows this these rules:

- If your skill level is equal o
 recipe, 100% of success rate.
- If your skill level is under o
 Success Rate = 100 - 9 *(minimu
 level).
 For example, the minimum skill 
 skill level is 7. The formula i
 rate.
 Under 11 levels the success rat

To raise the skill level, when
you success create/upgrade an
item with more low success rate,
more your experience bar will
increase. So I suggest you to
try to create/upgrade those
items since you don't gain too
much exp with 100% success rate
items and you don't lose the
materials when you failure in
its creation. But remember, it's
up to you and it's only my
opinion, so you can raise your
level more slowly with 100%
success rate recipes (or near
it).

5.1. Accessory [Accessory]
********************************

Show that you can be a fashion
villager by making gorgeous
accessories to use or just to
give as gifts to anyone you
like. Also, accessories can be
used as specials equipments to
boost your status or give new
abilities to your character.

In order to start crafting
accessories, talk to Yue on
Monday and buy the Forge /
Workshop Station. To get shelves
to store materials, wait until
Wednesday and buy it from Yue.

To learn new recipes you can go
to Mana's and Barrett's class at
school, they will teach how to
prepare different accessories.
Another way is, if you already
know the recipe (like reading a
walkthrough), you can start
creating new accessories
immediately, if you have the
necessary materials. Also you
can try to mix some random
materials (if use some logic on
it), maybe you can get a result.
A learned recipe will be
registered in your book at
Accessories Table's options.

To save time of collecting
materials (or just to save them
for better creations), you can
concentrate in upgrading
accessories, since it doesn't
consume too many materials. The
max level of upgrade is 10, but
you can still keep upgrading to
raise your skills.

The recipes are ordered by
creation/upgrade, by their type
and finally by the skill level.
They'll follow the model shown
just below:

5.2. Forging                    
********************************

If you want something well done,
do it by yourself. To get the
best weapons, improve their
status and also increase the
charge from your farm's tools,
this skill is absolutely
necessary in your gameplay.

In order to start forging, talk
to Yue on Monday and buy the
Forge / Workshop. To get shelves
to store materials, wait until
Wednesday and buy it from Yue.

To learn new recipes you can go
to Barrett's class at school, he
will teach how to prepare
different forges. Another way is
if you already know the recipe
(like reading a walkthrough).
Also you can try to mix some
random materials (if use some
logic on it), maybe you can get
a result. A learned recipe will
be registered in your book at
Forging Anvil's options.

To save time of collecting
materials (or just to save them
for better creations), you can
concentrate in upgrading weapons
since it doesn't consume too
much materials. The max level of
upgrade is 10, but you can still
keep upgrading to raise your
skills.

The recipes are ordered by
creation/upgrade, by their type
and finally by the skill level.
They'll follow the model shown
just below:

5.3. Pharmacy [Pharmacy]
********************************

In order to start creating
medicine, talk to Yue on Monday
and buy the Pharmacy Station. To
get a refrigerator to store food
and alike, wait until Wednesday
and buy it from Yue.

In order to start creating
medicine, talk to Yue on Monday
and buy the Pharmacy Station. To
get a refrigerator to store the
ingredients, wait until
Wednesday to buy it from Yue.

To learn new recipes you can go
to Mana's and Barrett's classes
at school, they will teach how
to prepare different medicines.
When you kill the dungeon's
guardians and check the statue
closing a room entrance,
different recipes will be taught
to you as a reward for
completing the task. Another way
is if you already know the
recipe (like reading a
walkthrough). Also you can try
to mix some random ingredients
(if use some logic on it), maybe
you can get a result. A learned
recipe will be registered in
your book at Pharmacy Table's
options.

To raise Pharmacy there isn't a
best way to do it, so try to
create complementary ingredients
for cooking (Sour Drop, Heavy
Spice and Sweet Powder for
example), items that can help
you in farming or to explore
dungeons (like Greenifiers,
Formulas, Potions for example),
recipes that you can buy
ingredients from shop (Antidote,
Roundoff, Para-gone, etc), just
choose what is the best to you
in the moment.

The level of the item created
will be equal to the mean of all
the levels of the ingredients
used to make this item. For
example, if you mix a Red Grass
(level 7) and a Red Grass (level
2), using a simple Mean Formula:
(7 + 2) / 2 = 4.5, so you will
create a Heavy Spice level 4
(result rounded down).

The recipes are ordered by the
skill level. They'll follow the

5.4. Cooking                    
********************************

After taking a good care of your
animals and collect their stuff,
growing up the vegetables and
fruits on your farm, you can
make a good use of them. Prepare
the favorites dishes of a
villager as a gift and give to
him/her, show to everyone your
cooking skills or simple do a
more expensive item to sell.

In order to start forging, talk
to Yue on Monday and buy the
Large Kitchen (the small one
only allows to use the Pot,
Frying Pan and Knife, while the
large one offers all this and
the oven, steamer and mixer). To
get a refrigerator to store food
and alike, wait until Wednesday
and buy it from Yue. You can buy
the utensils on Friday.

To learn new recipes you can go
to Mana's class at school, she
will teach how to prepare
different dishes and what
utensils you need. Another way
is if you already know the
recipe (like reading a
walkthrough). Also you can try
to mix some random ingredients
(if use some logic on it), maybe
you can get a result. A learned
recipe will be registered in
your book at utensils options.

Different from other items
creation, when you failed to
cook your ingredients will be
lost, creating an item called
"Failed Dish", so be careful
with it (you use save/load to
avoid this). To raise Cooking
there isn't a best way to do it,
so try to create complementary
ingredients for cooking (Bread,
Butter, Rice Ball for example),
recipes that have easy materials
to get, recipes near the minimum
level required, just choose what
is the best to you in the
moment.

The level of the item will be
equal to the mean of all the
levels of the ingredients used
to make this item. For example,
if you fry a Rice (level 1), a
Carrot (level 3), a Curry Powder
(level 1), a Green Pepper (level
2), an Onion (level 3) and an
Oil (level 1), using a simple
Mean Formula: (1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3
+ 1) / 6 = 1.8333, so you will
create a Dry Curry level 1
(result rounded down).

The recipes are ordered by the
utensil needed and the skill
level. They'll follow the model
shown just below:

5.5. Wi-Fi Evolution [Wifi]
********************************

In this game, besides leveling
up your weapons and accessories,
you can also evolve them by
trading specific high level
items with your friends via
Wireless or Nintendo Wi-Fi
Connection. To do so, all you
need to do is to have the
correct level 10 item with you
and start a wireless connection
by interacting with the mirror
in the bedroom of your house,
after that, find someone you
want to trade items with and
start trading. If you send (or
receive) a level 10 weapon or
accessory that can evolve, a
message will alert your friend
(or you) that the item has
changed. When that happens, a
new evolved and more powerful
item will be received on the
other side at level 1 (don't
worry, it's still more powerful
than before). Of course you can
also upgrade the new item up to
level 10 again and increase even
more its power.

Just in case you don't know, in
order to get higher level items,
follow the upgrade steps
described in the corresponding
section above.

The sections below explain which
item you need to trade and what
it'll evolve to once it reaches
the other player. The
accessories are ordered
alphabetically and the weapons
by attack power.

6. Fighting                     
################################

In Rune Factory series, fighting
is an important part of the
game, since you'll need to do
this a lot once you start
entering the dungeons available.
This section will present some
info concerning fighting, the
weapons and Rune Abilities of
the game.


********************************
6.1. Elemental Attributes
     [Attributes]
********************************

There are six Elemental
Attributes in this game and they
affect the damage taken /
inflicted when an elemental
equipment or monster faces
another elemental enemy.

There are three pairs of
opposing elemental:

- Fire and Water
- Wind and Earth
- Light and Darkness

The relationship of the
elementals in one pair is as
follows: the damage inflicted by
one of the elements on the other
one is increased so, if, for
example, a fire-type weapon hits
a water-type monster, the
damaged will be increased, since
they're opposing elementals. On
the other hand, if an elemental
attack of the same type as the
elemental defense is used, the
damage will be decreased, for
example, a wind-type attack
against a wind-type monster will
deal less damage than it should.


********************************
6.2. Status Ailments [Ailments]
********************************

Sometimes you'll be affected by
some Status Ailments during the
game, not only by fighting
monsters but also for not
sleeping well, stepping on
venom, etc.. If you're affected
by any status at the moment, a
status icon will appear just
below the HP and RP bar in the
upper left corner of the screen.
You can touch and hold it to see
the status name.

I'll list below the status that
can be inflicted upon you as you
play, what it does and how to
heal it.

All Status Ailments may be
healed, besides the way I tell
below in each of them, by asking
Natalie to heal you in the
clinic ("I'm not feeling very
well." option). She'll charge
you 100G.

 twice without healing). Can be

  healed by eating a Roundoff.

Also there is one beneficial
status, "Food", it'll appear
after you consume an item (Raw
crops, dishes, some medicines)
and will boost some specific
stats for a time. Each item
gives a different effect and
have different duration periods
(check the Pharmacy and Cooking
section to know those effects).


********************************
6.3. Accessories [Accessories]
********************************

Accessories provides a lot of
kinds of bonuses for the
character and you should have
some of them for each situation
you face. Bonuses may include
additional defense, attributes,
protection against elementals,
status ailments, etc.

In order to fight properly and
be able to face the monster the
best way possible, it's
important to know the equipment
you can choose so that it'll fit
your style.

That said, I'll show a list of
the weapons I've seen so far and
its status so that it can help
you in your decision. Notice the
items are considered to be level

* Second generation only


================================
6.4.1. Axe                      
================================

It has a nice attack power, only
lower than a hammer, and also
have a high critical rate ratio.
It works in a similar way as the
hammer, but do not knock out the
enemies. Choose this over the
hammer if you want to get more
critical hits. Even though this
is a great weapon to dealing a
lot of damage in one strike, its
attacks are very slow, making it
a bit difficult to fight with.
Notice that, by using the axe as
a weapon you won't increase the
Weapons skill level, but instead
the Logging one. You can also
chop wood with this weapon, the
same way as the farming axe.

6.4.2. Hammer                   
================================

It has the highest attack power
of all weapons. Its powerful
strikes allows you to knock out
foes and keep them away from
you. Even tough you inflict a
large damage and keep enemies
away, you need to be careful
when facing more than one foe at
once or when you're fighting
against a quick enemy, since
this is a very slow weapon and
require some ability to use it
effectively. Notice that, by
using the hammer as a weapon
you'll increase the Mining skill
level, instead of the Weapons
one. You can also mine and break
rocks with this weapon, the same
way as the farming hammer.

critical hit ratio and the swing
affects a large area, so you'll
be able to do a lot of damages

================================
6.4.4. Rod                      
================================

It's not a good weapon by
itself, due to its very low
attack power. However, it's a
nice pick for a conjurer,
because most, if not all, of
them increases your intelligence
attribute and hence your magic
power, allowing you to cast more
powerful Rune Abilities.
Additionally, this is one of the
weapons, besides the shortsword,
that allows you to equip a
shield and improve your defense.
Even tough it's very versatile,
since there are a good variety
of Rune Abilities that can
benefit from this bonus, you
need to be careful about your
RP, because, unlike the other
weapons, the Rune Abilities
cannot be casted after you
deplete all your RP by consuming
HP, so you should always have
another weapon at your disposal
just in case you need it in the
middle of a fight, as I really
don't recommend trying to fight
using the rod itself, since it's
very weak and can't chain
attacks. Notice as well there
aren't Skill Seals for rods so
it's a bit more limited.

6.4.5. Shortsword [Shortsword]
================================

Allows you to defeat your
enemies by unleashing a rapid
series of attacks. Even though
the attacks are quick they're
not so strong and be careful
about the last strike, since it
lets you very vulnerable. This
is one of the two weapons that
allows you to equip a shield at
the same time, the other being
the rod, improving your defense
and hence, decreasing the damage
taken. Nice pick for beginners,
but also good for some veterans.

Shields are only useful if
you're fighting with a
shortsword or a rod, since no
other weapon allows you to equip
a shield at the same time (the
shield bonus will not be applied
if you equip another weapon).
So, if you like to use the
shortsword or cast magics to
fight, you really should take
advantage of this defense bonus
that, as you unlock new shields,
may affect significantly the
damage you take from monsters
you fight against.

This is where you and all of the
people you interact with live.
So it's important to know it
well and take advantage of

Here you can find out about the

7.1. Village Map                
********************************

Well, I'm really not good at
ASCII drawing, but I think this
map will help the players to
know where to go when needed.

Each of the 10 squares
correspond to an area of the
village. In the top of each
square is the name of that area
(the one that is shown in the
game) and in the middle of them
are some important spots you
should know.

To get access to Palermo Shrine,
please take a look at the
corresponding section in this
guide under Dungeons.

7.4. School                     
********************************

An important institution for any
town, where children go to learn
a lot of new things to help in
their education and become the
future of nation. The Alvarna
Academy is under the guidance of
good teachers (Mana and
Barrett), they'll teach many
important things in second
generation that you couldn't do
in the first one. This is only
available at second generation
and marks the end of the first
game arc. Mana's classes are
from AM 09:00 until AM 11:15.
Barret's start at PM 12:00

Kyle couldn't complete all
school's facilities, so it's up
to his descendants to finish
this task and give the kids more
options of learning (oh, how
cool you are, the children are
now really happy to have extra
lessons). Check out the
Buildings/Expansions section to
get more details.

The Alvarna Academy is divided
in four different sections, you
can access them at anytime you
want, I'm going to list and
explain them all in the
following subsections.


================================
7.4.1. Classroom [Classroom]
================================

Mana and Barrett give important
lessons about cooking, forging,
medicine creation and other
stuffs. You can only have two
classes per day (I mean you can
only check two different topics
in the blackboard per day) with
each teacher, except on holidays
when you don't have class. Also
note that each day of the week
have different sets of topics.
After you have learned a lesson
it will disappear from the
options (except the first
lessons and, on Friday,
Barrett's first lesson will
disappear but Hammer Basics
won't).

Mana can be found in Alvarna
Academy - Classroom in the
morning (AM 09:00 - AM 11:05).
She'll teach you about cooking,
pharmacy and accessories
production, she can also repair
magic books, but only if you
bring the book and the right
Missing Page in order (that
means Mana can't restore a more
advanced page if you don't have
the previous ones). Next I'll
list her lessons topics and what
do you learn from them:

of things you can use, so I'll
try to give a brief explanation
about the item and utensil you

them by getting close to one of
them and pressing the action
button or touching the screen.

7.6. Quests - First Generation
     [Quests1]
********************************

The header below is an example
of how the quests are disposed.
Each character's quest is in a
different section identified by
his/her name. Inside that
section you'll see one table for
each quest that character
requests you. The tables are
sorted by request order of that
character.

Each table contains: the title
of the quest, the description
you can see in the game, what
you need to fulfill before
taking that quest, the
friendship or love level in
which the character will request
that quest, what you can obtain
by completing it and at last, an
explanation of what you should
do to finish it.

Just a note, for some quest read
the section How to Complete
before you go to talk to the
person who gives the quest, so
you can take the asked item
first and save some time (only
recommended for such item like
monster's drops or commons
(grass, mining rocks,
fruits...)). For monsters
hunting quests, you can take a
tamed monster with you to help
and complete it more easily.

To start a new quest, go and
check the Bulletin Board at De
Sainte-coquille Park until 6 PM.
In festival days and after that
time you can't start a new quest
anymore, however if you already
have start a new one, you still
can complete it (in festivals
days too).

you'll actually LOSE money in
this quest. Even though she pays
100G for the quest, just after
the fortune telling thing she
charges 200G as a payment for
the same job, so you'll end up
losing 100G. Well, since this is
not really that much money it
doesn't really matter.

Crossroad for her fortune-
telling. As she told, go there
and walk to right and go up all
the way until you see it behind
the right Gate that summons the
second Orc Viking. Take it and
deliver to her, but if you
already have an Amethyst and
want to finish as quick as
possible this quest, just give
it to her, receiving your a
little tip and changing the way
that she sees you.

    of us?
Requirement: Have completed
Alicia's second quest: "I Want
This No Matter What" Love Level:
2 Reward: 200G

How to Complete: Alicia wants
you to talk with Cecilia because
when she read her love fortune,
she told a handsome man would

Friendship Level: 0
Reward: Toyherb Seed

How to Complete: Talk to Cammy.
She'll say if you go through her
training you'll become a Super-
Kyle (or the name you choose for
your character), wow! Seriously,
the game is not that difficult,
she'll say a sequence of four
punches (either left or right
each) and after that she'll ask
you to repeat them one at a time
at the same order she said.
There is no need to rush, just
pay attention to what she says,
take note if you think it'll be
necessary, and then just choose
the same directions she said.
This will be repeated four
times, and if you manage to do 3
out of the 4 correctly you'll
win and finish the quest. If you
couldn't, just talk to her again
and she'll restart the training.
By the way, you won't earn a
better reward if you do all the
sequences correctly, so don't
bother if you miss one of them.


Super Training Plan: Luck!
--------------------------------
Description: Improve your luck
with rock paper scissors!
Requirement: Have completed
Cammy's first quest: "Super
Training Plan:
    Strength!"
Friendship Level: Between 1 and
2 Reward: Tomato Seed

How to Complete: Talk to Cammy.
Your personal trainer prepared
the second part of your train to
become the Super-Kyle. And for
that it is essential to raise an
important attribute for any
superhero, your luck in Rock,
Paper, Scissors (RPS), since
this is a very dangerous battle
until death. Cammy won't take
easy and your battle consist in
10 matches and you need to
choose one command (rock, paper
or scissors) and win at least 6
of the matches (see below a
winning strategy). If you win,
you'll be one step closer from
your final form and a lot more
prepared to defeat any villain
with your RPS combat style.

Winning Strategy in RPS
(contributed by a.tran): Cammy's
choices actually follow a
pattern. And it is possible to
predict what she is going to
choose next.

The first round of RPS is pure
luck. However starting on the
second round you can begin
manipulating the game.

I will show you a few rounds of
RPS as an example, then explain
the pattern (Keep in mind the
first round is pure luck)

R1: Me: Rock (Random choice) R1:
Cammy: paper (Her random answer)
R2: Me: Scissors (Winning
choice) R2: Cammy: Paper (Her
pattern choice) R3: Me: Paper
(Winning choice) R3: Cammy: Rock
(Her pattern choice) R4: Me:
Rock (...) R4: Cammy: Scissors

This is kind of difficult to
explain, but once you catch on
it will all make sense.

For example, if you picked Rock
on the first round (a random
choice), you'll have no idea
what Cammy will choose in this
round. But you'll know what
she'll choose in the next one.
Alright, so you pick rock, and
say she picks paper. Cammy wins
Round one.

In the next round, Cammy will
choose paper because it beats
rock which is what you picked in
the previous round. Because you
know she'll choose paper, you'll
choose scissors (a winning
choice) so you can beat her. By
the same logic, you also know
that Cammy will choose rock on
the next round, because rock
beats scissors which is what you
chose in this round. Since you
know that Cammy will pick rock,
you must choose paper to beat
her.

In short: Cammy will choose
whichever element
(rock/paper/scissors) that is
superior to the element you
picked in the previous round.
Since you know that, you will
choose whichever element is
superior to her in the current
round because she is choosing
whichever is superior to you in
the last round.

This logic may be a bit
difficult to understand, so if
you didn't get it by the
explanation above, don't worry,
just proceed according to the
instructions below:

- First Round: Choose any elemen
- Starting from the second round
    - If you chose Rock in the p
    - If you chose Paper in the 
    - If you chose Scissors in t

Following the instructions above
you should be able to win at
least 9 of the 10 round and thus
win the challenge.

some names and you need to
memorize them in order. If you
get one answer wrong it will
start all over again.

Dorothy's sixth quest:
"Something about the
    Future..."
Love Level: 6
Reward: Glazed Yam

How to Complete: Talk to
Dorothy. She'll tell that there
is a lot of times she can't find
Cammy around the town, so maybe
Cammy is going into the forest,
a very dangerous place to her.
Since she won't listen Dorothy,
it's up to you try to talk with
Cammy. Find her and convince
about the dangers in there. Go

I Made Some Cookies

Love Level: 7 Reward: A cookie,
but you will eat it soon as you
get.

How to Complete: Meet Dorothy at
Alvarna - West End and talk to
her. While she was trying to
bake some chocolate cookies, she
burned about 8 batches of it (my
gosh). Try one and answer
whatever you want, but if you
want to say the cookies taste
good, choose "These are really
good!" (if you answer "These are
awful!" she will say some
ingredients of the recipe, how
yummy). After that Cammy will
come and say something about the
cookies depending of which
answer you gave. I suggest you

Requirement: Have completed
Dorothy's eighth quest: "I Made
Some Cookies" Love Level: 8
Reward: See how Dorothy is
changing.

How to Complete: Talk to
Dorothy. Fern won't talk to her.
You'll try to give some explain
about it and the fact that she
is becoming closer to her other
friends (and more psychologist
talking). Just a conversation
quest.


I...Have Something...to Say
--------------------------------
Description: There's, erm,
something I want to talk to you
about... Requirement: Have
completed Dorothy's ninth quest:
"It's about Fern..." Love Level:
9 Reward: Charm

How to Complete: Note: Take this
quest as the last one of the day
(needs 2 days to complete). Talk
to Dorothy. She wants you to
take her on another date (yeah,
she is changing), but she is
really nervous to do that now,
so she asks you to meet her
tomorrow at Alvarna - Port. Wait
until the next day and meet her
in the promised place (she'll be
there the entire day, so go when
you think it's good for you).
Start a conversation, you'll
have to choose some options to
proceed with this quest. You can
select any option, all them will
give you an information about
Dorothy, so I suggest to see all
them if you have time. In the
end get your reward.

How to Complete: Talk to Douglas
and he'll ask you to go to
Trieste Forest and bring him a
Bull Horn. Do as he says and
proceed to the forest. Once
there, you won't need to fight
any monster at all, just look
for a horn lying on the ground
in the upper left side of the
Trieste Forest - Spring Clearing
(I mean the area after the
savepoint, where some ball-
shaped red monsters spawn) and
get it. After that go back to
Douglas, give him the Bull Horn

Description: I can't bring
myself to give her this letter!
Requirement: Have completed
Douglas's first quest: "Get This
for Me" Friendship Level:
Between 1 and 2 Reward: 100

want to apologize, so he wrote a
letter to her but don't have
courage to deliver it. Take it
and prepare for the longest
travel in your life, walking
through dangerous places
infested by monsters and
complete your mission as a real
postman (just find Mana...). She
will ask you to tell to her
father that she isn't mad with
him anymore, so go back all the
way and tell the news to
Douglas.


Let's Talk about This Like Men

things like men. Requirement:
Have completed Douglas's second
quest: "I Got into a Fight with
    Mana..."
Friendship Level: Near 3
Reward: Empty Bottle

Douglas. Talking like a true
man, Douglas says that Mana
likes someone and asks if you
know who he is. Choose any
option and Douglas will say Mana
and him (Ray, Jake, Barrett or
Max) don't combine with her, but
to proceed you need to answer
all the alternatives. With all
this we can get only one
conclusion, for the Douglas's
anger. Finish the conversation
and take your prize.

you will NEVER marry my
daughter! Requirement: Have
completed Douglas's third quest:

How to Complete: Time to be a
real man. Talk to Douglas and
he'll tell you to meet him in
Trieste Forest - Wooded
Paradise. Go there and start
another conversation. Tell him
how you fell about Mana (maybe
it isn't true since you can't
really choose an answer) and
Douglas will challenge you. A
Giant Orc will come to
interfere, and it's up to you to
put an end in this and save
Douglas's butt. The battle is
stupid since the monster only
have size, but his attack and
life points are equal an
ordinary Orc. Finish it and talk
to Douglas at the east of the
map.

Friendship Level: 0
Reward: Clippers

How to Complete: Talk to Egan.
He'll tell he's trying to think
up some new recipes for the
customers and he wants someone
to try them out. He'll then give
a new fish dish he made and will
ask your opinion about it. I'm
not sure if this changes
anything, such as friendship,
but if you answer "Try making it
really spicy.", he'll say your
response is not very reasonable.
The same applies to the "Try
adding a lot of vinegar.".
Choosing these options slightly
change the final dialogue, but
you'll get the reward the same
way, no matter your answers.

So, if you want to be sure and
give the best answers, choose
"Try adding more salt." and "Try
adding a little wine.", this way
Egan will tell you really helped
to make something better for the
customers.

Cecilia something for me,

Friendship Level: Between 1 and

How to Complete: Talk to Egan.
He's running out of ingredients
and want you to ask Cecilia to
bring some Toyherbs. Go and look
for her, telling the message.
Return and report the news,
getting the prize. Sometimes we
wonder why they can't simply go
and do what they want instead of
posting the request (that's more
difficult than the task).


Going to the Forest?
--------------------------------
Description: I have something to
take care of in forest. If
anyone is headed

Cecilia. Go to Trieste Forest

from the apple tree just above
the Gate which spawn Orcs.
Notice this is the same tree
that produces apples regularly
each 3 days, and a new apple
won't be produced specifically
for this quest so, if you
already gathered them one or two
days ago, you won't find the
apples in the tree until you
wait the three days regrow time.
But, if the tree doesn't have
any apple and you don't want to
wait some days, there is still a
way. All you need to do is to go
the second area in this same
dungeon: Trieste Forest - Spring
Clearing and defeat some Pomme
Pomme (the red ball shaped
monster) in this area, as they
drop apples when defeated.
Remember the monster only spawns
during day, so if it's night
there's nothing you can do other
than waiting at least one day.
Finally, after getting the
apple, return it to Egan and get
your prize.


Lost-and-Found

Friendship Level: 0
Reward: 400G

How to Complete: Talk to Gordon.
He'll tell you he wants you to
bring an Amethyst that can be
found in Blessia Island and
he'll give you a hammer. This
time the item won't be just
lying on the ground, you'll need
to use the hammer you got to
break the rocks in the island
and mine the amethyst from them.
Well, go to the port and take
the boat to Blessia Island. Once
there, explore the island
looking for the mining stones,
if you find some, break them
with your hammer and, if you
find a purple stone (Amethyst)
when you do this, you'll have
found the item you seek so go
back to the village and give it
to Gordon to receive the reward.

Just to let you know, there are
two stones you can break in
Blessia Island - South Beach
(after save point) and 7 stones
in Blessia Island - Center. If
you broke them all and, for some
reason, were unlucky and
couldn't find the Amethyst,
you'll have to wait until the
next day in order to be able to
mine from these stones once
again.

time he'll request an Aquamarine
that can be found in Trieste
Forest. Break mining stones with
your hammer and, if you find a
blue stone (Aquamarine) go back
and give it to Gordon and
receive your reward. If you
already have an Aquamarine in
your possession, you can give it
to Gordon at once.

Just to let you know, there are
four stones you can break in
Trieste Forest - Aegis Falls. If
you broke them all and, for some
reason, were unlucky and
couldn't find the Aquamarine,
you'll have to wait until the
next day in order to be able to
mine from these stones once
again.


Please Get Me Some Sturdy String

For now he need a Strong String

priest he can't go and fight
with those poor creatures. So
wait until night and go to
Trieste Forest - Grassy Path (2
Gates) or Trieste Forest -
Wooded Paradise (1 Gate spawning
both 1 ant and 1 spider). I
suggest you go to the first
option and keep killing until it
drops the item, but if you're
getting in trouble against 2
monsters at the same time,
destroy one Gate to make things
easier. Go back to Gordon and
finish the quest. If you already
have a Strong String in your
possession, you can give it to
Gordon at once.

Looks like he really collects
ores, so now you have to find a
Diamond to him, but it can be a
little difficult since it's a
rare item. Go to Padova
Mountains and break mining
stones with your hammer and, if
you find a Diamond go back and
give it to Gordon and receive
your reward.

Just to let you know, there are
eight stones that you can break
in Padova Mountains - Flowing
River and six more in Padova
Mountains - Freezing Cave. If
you broke them all and, for some
reason, were unlucky and
couldn't find the Diamond,
you'll have to wait until the

How to Complete: Talk to Julia.
She was worried with people
around, as they could take a
little more care about how they
look, so she started to think
and concluded that maybe they
don't know the first thing about
beauty. Julia understood the
situation and decided to
enlighten they obscured vision,
bringing the true beauty for a
better world. As the chosen one,
Julia will need some help to put
her "Beauty Promotion Plan" in
action and guide her people. For
that she tells you to get into
the tub (and like Cecilia's
third quest, don't get any hope
or you will only hurt your
feelings) while she supervises
(?). Do as she say and start the
"Operation: Extended Bathtime".
As soon it begins Julia will get
bored and start to talk with you
again (to see how important is
this mission) about her. During

when Natalie was still in there,
getting her really mad. After

complain more about Julia. Just

one go to Messhina Valley -
Serene Garden. Try to pick it

Ore to Yue and she will
transform it a special ring for
10000G. Talk to her again and

you, but she'll give a lot of
excuses to say that she want to
go out but it isn't because she
is in love with you. Meet her in
Alvarna - Port at AM 6 in the
next day (in the truth she will
be there the entire day, so go
when you want). Start a
conversation, walk with her to

Love Level: 1 Reward: 200G and
100 piece of woods

How to Complete: Talk to Mana.
She'll request you to bring her
a 4-Leaf Clover from Blessia
Island so take the boat from the
docks and go there. Proceed to
the third area (Blessia Island -
Center). You'll find the clover
on the ground, next to the
farming soil in this area, just
pick it up and go give it to
Mana. But why did you need to
get this for her?

--------------------------------

for the store have vanished!
Requirement: Have completed
Mana's second quest: "I Want a
Four Leaf Clover" Love Level: 2
Reward: 200G

How to Complete: Talk to Mana.
She lost her Aquamarine in

it is so small, you will not see
it as the other quest items
laying on the floor. Ok, from
where Mana is, walk down the
right stairs and check the
wooden box exactly next to the
stairs in her direction (two
squares east to her). Give back
to her and finish the quest.
Easy task.

She suddenly had a craving to
eat Salmon. Time to prove your

Messhina Valley - Path to
Mountain. Mana will follow and
watch you fish, but as a man you
can't let a lady in a such
dangerous place, telling her to
go back (and making the fortune
failure (?)). Ok, try to fish a
Salmon. I suggest you to stay
near the bridge to the next map
(Messhina Valley - Serene Garden
and use your pole there. Maybe
you need to try several times as
it is a little difficult to fish
a Salmon in this map. After you
catch one, give it to Mana to
make her happy.

Port. Wait one day (you don't
need to wait until PM 6:00, Mana
will be there the entire day)
and walk in the direction of the
boat and talk to Mana. She'll
ask if you like someone, and you
will automatically answer that
you really don't have anyone
special for now and after that
she will accept this fact and
leave the place. If you forget

at you, but if that happens, you
only need to abandon and redo
the quest.

a date?), going to Blessia
Island - South Beach. Mana will

and completed "Please
    Deliver Something for Me" (M
Love Level: 0
Reward: 2000G

How to Complete: Talk to
Rosalind and she'll give you
some direction on how to find
the Lamp Grass in Trieste
Forest. You won't be able to
actually see and pick this grass
as you could do with some other
items, Instead, you'll have to
follow her directions and, once
you walk through the right place
on the forest you'll
automatically notice the flower
growing at your feet and you'll
be asked whether you want to to
take it or not (obviously take
it when you find it).

Ok, so here's how you can find
the Lamp Grass. Enter Trieste
Forest and go to Trieste Forest
- Spring Clearing. Once you
enter this area, just keep
walking over the grass on the
right side, near the wooden
fence and you'll quickly be be
asked to take the grass. After
taking it, go back to Rosalind
and give her the item to claim
your valuable prize!


Please Find Me an Apple

Description: I need a special
kind of apple from a specific
place. Could you

Rosalind's first quest: "Please

    Grass"
Love Level: 1
Reward: 4000G and Harvest Basket

How to Complete: Talk to
Rosalind. She'll ask you to get
an Apple from Trieste Forest
since this place is too
dangerous for a lady. So as a
true gentleman go to Trieste
Forest
- Grassy Path. When you arrive i
from the apple tree just above
the Gate which spawn Orcs.
Notice this is the same tree
that produces apples regularly
each 3 days, and a new apple
won't be produced specifically
for this quest so, if you
already gathered them one or two
days ago, you won't find the
apples in the tree until you
wait the three days regrow time.
But, if the tree doesn't have
any apple and you don't want to
wait some days, there is still a
way. All you need to do is to go
the second area in this same
dungeon: Trieste Forest - Spring
Clearing and defeat some Pomme
Pomme (the red ball shaped
monster) in this area, as they
drop apples when defeated. I
know Rosalind asked specifically
the apples from the tree, but
she'll accept these apples as
well, so don't worry. Remember
the monster only spawns during
day, so if it's night there's
nothing you can't other than
wait at least one day. Finally,
after getting the apple, return
to Rosalind and get your prize.


Please Deliver Something for Me

from previous quest). Take the
Secret Letter and show your

current situation and finish
your mission.

How to Complete: Expanding your
experience in different jobs,

you have a hard time taking
medicine (?). Since you seem
perfect for her purpose, she
developed a medicine and want
you as a guinea pig (or as she
say, a "Research Assistant") to
see how effective it is and help
advance her scientific
knowledge. For the sake of
science and humanity (ok, in the
truth you are a moron), Kyle
decides to test it. To do that,
the test subject must have what
is commonly know as a "cold"
(simple get sick by sleeping
after 3 am twice, also you can
caught a cold before start this
quest). Talk to Rosalind again
and she'll test her new
treatment on you, restoring your
healthy and giving your reward.

up this opportunity (and why
would refuse that?). So go to

Rosalind there (the theme will
change for you to see how
important this moment is). Enjoy
your picnic and have a nice
memory.

capture a monster for me? (See
me for details.) Requirement:
Have completed Rosalind's fifth
quest: "Private Message 1" Love

How to Complete: Talk to
Rosalind. She wants you to catch
a Wooly for her. In the truth
she wants you to get a Small
Fleece (item produced by a Wooly
at low friendship level). So if
you already have a Wolly at your
barn just pick the item and
deliver to her (note: Woolies
just produce Small Fleece 3 days
after you shaved it or just when
you caught one). If you don't
have a Wooly or just shaved some
days before, first you need to
build a barn if you don't have

7.1. Monster Taming for further
     details) and have go to

Reward: Prove her you're not a
coward

How to Complete: Talk to
Rosalind. She goes straight to
the point and tells she wants to
test a spell that will cause a
localized explosion (pretty
dangerous), for that you need to
see if the spells work properly.
Trust in her and go to Trieste
Forest Entrance. Start a
conversation and discover that
it was just a plan of her to see
if you would come to meet her
and do a crazy test, don't
bothering with anything.


Please Get Some Rare Ingredients
--------------------------------
Description: I would really
appreciate it if someone could
find these rare
    ingredients for me. (See me

Love Level: 7

anything about the Gold Cabbage.
She really wants one and will
pay a lot if you find it. Talk
to her a second time and she
will say to talk with her

room. Wait until he goes to his
room (see Schedule section to
know when he goes) and talk to
him. Max will say that he
already have one and will give

(the best monetary reward)

How to Complete: Talk to
Rosalind. As Yue, Rosalind is
having some problems with the
son of the head of the trading
firm that does business with her
father's company. Herman says he
is a very good candidate to her,
but she already likes another
man (who could he be?), so
Rosalind turned him down (good
thing to hear). But now the
problem appeared. Herman asked
with who she wanted to marry
(what do you think it was her
answer?) and also indirectly
said that he always wanted to
try a Royal Curry and if only
you could get one of these for
him, he probably would accept
Rosalind's choice. So it's time
to do your best and seize this
chance to prove her choice
wasn't wrong. Like the previous
quest, wait until Max go to his
room (see Schedule section to
know when he goes) and tell him
your problems. Again, as a
magic, he already have one and
give you for free (maybe he
listen all his sister problems
and wishes and as a good brother
try to help her as much he can).
Deliver it to Rosalind and you
both will be teleported to
Herman's room. Talk to Herman
(and discover how big is his
appetite) and he will say that
there isn't exist anyone more
perfect to her than you (he
sells her daughter for a dish, I
can see how much love he have
for her...)

at your earliest convenience.

Rosalind's ninth quest: "Private

Rosalind. She wants an official
date with you, now that her dad
approves your relationship with
her, at Blessia Island - Summer
Isle Port. It can be a little
dangerous to go there but since
you're with her, she doesn't
have anything to worry about. Go
there and meet her near the save
point. Rosalind says it'll be
just you the two of you (but
coincidently when I was doing
this quest it was Tuesday and
Yue was also there too) and will
start a poetic conversation. The
quest is over but after that
Kyle will mention that is good
to talk to Max in his room to
know what to do now.


================================
7.6.18. Roy                     
================================

I Need a Favor. Come Over?
--------------------------------
Description: Come talk to me...
I really messed something up...
Requirement: Have talked to Roy
at least once before and
completed "Please
    Deliver Something for Me" (M
Friendship Level: 0
Reward: Steamed Bread

How to Complete: Talk to Roy.
He'll ask you to bring him a
Cheap Cloth that can be obtained
by killing the orcs in Trieste
Forest. You'll want to have a
sword or some other weapon
before trying this quest. You
can also fight with your farming
tools, such as the hammer,
sickle, axe or even the hoe, but
the fight will be easier if you
have a real weapon, so it's your
choice. If you don't have one
but want to buy it, just take a
look at Tanya's shop (The
Sharper Edge Blacksmithing) and
you'll find them (the cheapest
is the spear, 1000G). If you
have the money pick the one you
think is the best for you.

Proceed to Trieste Forest.
You'll need to kill some club
orcs to find the Cheap Cloth.
They can be found on Trieste
Forest - Grassy Path or Trieste
Forest - Wooded Paradise during
day, that is, before PM 6:00. In
the Grassy Path, there are two
Gates that spawn the orc, so if
you think it's difficult to
fight against two of them at the
same time, try to destroy one of
the Gates, so that only one will
keep respawning orcs. In Wooded
Paradise, both monsters are
spawned by the same Gate, so
you'll have to deal with both at
the same time, just notice that
one of them is an Archer Orc and
it doesn't drop the item you
want when it's defeated.

After killing just a few orcs
you should be able to have one
of them to drop a chest. Open
the chest and you'll get the
Cheap Cloth. Go back to the
village and give it to Roy to
finish the job.


I Need Something Else
--------------------------------
Description: Something else
happened... Stop by for a
little? Requirement: Have
completed Roy's first quest: "I
Need a Favor. Come Over?"

Shoulder Piece (dropped by Orc
Viking) and you need to get
another one before his mother
notices. Go to Padova Mountains
- Crossroad or Padova Mountains
- Freezing Cave and kill the Orc
Viking until he drops the item
and then go back and deliver it
to Max and save another day. If
you already have the Shoulder
Piece with you, give it to Roy
at once.


I Could Use Your Help
--------------------------------
Description: I want to make
something and I could use your
help! Come see me! Requirement:
Have completed Roy's second
quest: "I Need Something Else"
Friendship Level: Between 2 and
3 Reward: Charm

How to complete: Talk to Roy. He
didn't break anything now, in
truth he just want to know if
you have some kind of good-luck
charm to carry around. As you
don't have one, Roy'll ask you
to look for an Emerald to make
one to you (it looks like you're
popular with children). As
always, Emeralds can be found in
Trieste Forest. Break mining
stones with your hammer and, if
you find a green stone go back
and give it to Roy and receive
your reward. If you already have
an Emerald with you, give it to
Roy at once.

Again, just to let you know,
there are four stones you can
break in Trieste Forest - Aegis
Falls. If you broke them all
and, for some reason, were
unlucky and couldn't find the
Emerald, you'll have to wait
until the next day in order to
be able to mine from these
stones once again.


There's Something I Really Want
--------------------------------
Description: I want a ruby no
matter what happens. Come talk
to me. Requirement: Have
completed Roy's third quest: "I
Could Use Your Help" Friendship
Level: Near 3 Reward: Yam Seed

How to complete: Talk to Roy. He
needs a Ruby (since Cammy's got
one he doesn't have peace). So
Proceed to Blessia Island. Once
there, explore the island
looking for the mining stones,
if you find some, break them
with your hammer and, if you
find a red stone (Ruby) when you
do this, you'll have found the
item you seek so go back to the
village and give it to Roy to
receive the reward. If you
already have a Ruby with you,
give it to Roy at once.

Just to let you know, there are
two stones you can break in
Blessia Island - South Beach
(after save point) and 7 stones
in Blessia Island - Center. If
you broke them all and, for some
reason, were unlucky and
couldn't find the Ruby, you'll
have to wait until the next day
in order to be able to mine from
these stones once again. (and
yes, I'm using cut + paste)

7.6.19. Tanya                   
================================

Battle Strategies: Orc
--------------------------------
Description: There's something
that I want to talk to you
about... Come by and
    see me, 'kay? Quest Can Be R
Requirement: Have talked to
Tanya at least once before and
completed "Please
    Deliver Something for Me" (M
Friendship Level: 0
Reward: 500G and Axe

How to Complete: Talk to Tanya.
Rather than a request, she'll
give you a trial. She wants you
to go to Trieste Forest and kill
5 orcs. You'll want to have a
sword or some other weapon
before trying this quest. You
can also fight with your farming
tools, such as the hammer,
sickle, axe or even the hoe, but
the fight will be easier if you
have a real weapon, so it's your
choice. If you don't have one
but want to buy it, just take a
look at Tanya's own shop and
you'll find them (the cheapest
is the spear, 1000G). If you
have the money pick the one you
think is the best for you.

Proceed to Trieste Forest.
You'll need to kill some club
orcs, archer orcs does not
count. They can be found on
Trieste Forest - Grassy Path or
Trieste Forest
- Wooded Paradise during day, th
are two Gates that spawn the
Orc, so if you think it's
difficult to fight against two
of them at the same time, try to
destroy one of the Gates, so
that only one will keep
respawning orcs. In Wooded
Paradise, both monsters are
spawned by the same Gate, so
you'll have to deal with both at
the same time, just notice that
one of them is an Archer Orc and
it doesn't count when it's
defeated.

If you defeat the correct
monster, you'll be alerted that
the one you killed is indeed the
target monster. So if you find
the one, defeat 5 of them
(you'll be notified again when
you reach your quota) and go
talk to Tanya again to claim
your reward. You can take this
quest again in the bulletin
board if you need money.


Battle Strategies: Orc
(Continued)
--------------------------------
Description: This time you're
going to take down some orc
archers! Come and see
    me for the details, 'kay? Qu
Requirement: Have completed
Tanya's first quest: "Battle
Strategies: Orc" Friendship
Level: 1 Reward: 700G

How to Complete: This is the
same as the previous quest,
except that now you'll need to
defeat 8 Orc Archers from
Trieste Forest. Talk to Tanya to
hear the trial and then go to
the forest. You'll need to kill
some archer orcs this time, club
orcs does not count. They can be
found on Trieste Forest - Aegis
Falls or Trieste Forest
- Wooded Paradise. In Aegis Fall
Archer, but they're very far
from one another so I don't
think it'll change anything.
Anyway, if for some reason both
of the orcs come to fight
against you and you think it's
difficult to fight against both
of them at the same time, try to
destroy one of the Gates, so
that only one will keep
respawning the Orc Archer. In
Wooded Paradise, both monsters
are spawned by the same Gate, so
you'll have to deal with both at
the same time, just notice that
one of them is a club orc and it
doesn't count when it's
defeated.

If you defeat the correct
monster, you'll be alerted that
the one you killed is indeed the
target monster. So if you find
the one, defeat 8 of them
(you'll be notified again when
you defeat 5 of them and when
you reach your quota) and go
talk to Tanya again to receive
the prize. You can take this
quest again in the bulletin
board if you need money.


Battle Strategies: Goblin Pirate
--------------------------------
Description: This time you'll be
tackling a Goblin Pirate! Quest
Can Be
    Replayed
Requirement: Have completed
Tanya's second quest: "Battle
Strategies: Orc
    (Continued)"
Friendship Level: 2
Reward: 1000G

How to Complete: Talk to Tanya.
As all Tanya's previous trials
you can repeat this one and you
need to kill 10 Goblin Pirates
(Goblin Gangster does not count)
for now, so you have 3 options
to go, Blessia Island - South
Beach (1 Gate), Blessia Island -
Altar/Old Ship (1 Gate) or
Blessia Island - Old Ship Deck
(1 Gate spawning both 1 Goblin
Gangster and 1 Goblin Pirate).
Choose the map which is most
suitable to you.

If you defeat the correct
monster, you'll be alerted that
the one you killed is indeed the
target monster. So if you find
the one, defeat 10 of them
(you'll be notified again when
you defeat 5 of them and when
you reach your quota) and go
talk to Tanya again to receive
the prize. You can take this
quest again in the bulletin
board if you need money.

yellow bottle. Take it and give
it to Yue to receive the daikon
seeds (After they grow, they'll
become Daikon Radishes, Yue's
favorite food, so if you want to
make her happy you can give her

note that they only show up in
the night. There is one in
Blessia Island - Center and two

Something's Wrong with My Kimono
--------------------------------
Description: There's something
wrong with my favorite kimono!
Help!!! Requirement: Have
completed Yue's second quest:
"Monster Money!" Love Level: 2
Reward: Fried Eggs

How to Complete: Talk to Yue.
She got a stain in her favorite
kimono and wants a White Grass
to remove it (she can't focus in
her work with this awful stain
in her kimono, sad thing). Do
this favor to her and look for a
White Grass, but you can do this
in three different ways:
1. Go to Padova Mountains -
   Flowing River. When you
   arrive, just walk to the
area where you can soil the
field and you'll see a white
grass lying in the floor, just
pick it and go back to her.
2. If you already have picked
   one in your travels to
   dungeon you can give to
her either.
3. Buy from Natalie for 150G.
Return and give it to her. Yue
will start to clean her kimono
and will be happy again.


Scaling the Phantom Sand
Dunes...
--------------------------------
Description: There's a special
item I need. Without it, I won't
be able to get
    over the sand dunes!
Requirement: Have completed
Yue's third quest: "Something's
Wrong with My
    Kimono"
Love Level: 3 Reward: Hachimaki
and 100 pieces of wood

How to Complete: Talk to Yue.
She needs to cross the Phantom
Sand Dunes, but this place is
made of countless tiny fragments
of glass, reflecting each
others, making impossible to see
what's around you. Because all
of that she wants you to get a
Shade Stone, because it can
block the reflections in the
sand and find a way to cross it.
So go to Messhina Valley - Path
to Mountain. Once there, walk to
the extreme north and check
behind the Gate that spawn
Goblin Archer, you'll find the
item there. Return and give it
to Yue, taking your prize.


I'm Having Trouble with Someone

Requirement: Have completed
Yue's fourth quest: "Scaling the
Phantom Sand
    Dunes..."
Love Level: 4
Reward: A kiss on the cheek

How to Complete: Poor Yue, a
stalker appeared in her life.
Talk to her and keep all the
conversation in secret. Cesar
flirts her every time she goes
to Greenlake, but she isn't
interested in a wealthy playboy.
To stop that Yue told him she
already had a boyfriend, but
needs a proof. So if she buys an
expensive Engagement Ring it
might be enough to scare him
off. For that she ask you to
help her and give 1000G to buy
the ring, choose "Give her
1000G" (if you choose "I'm
sorry, but I can't." she will
get mad and you need to start
all the conversation over
again). Yue will thank you and
give your "expensive" reward.


More Monster Money!
--------------------------------
Description: Okay, well, this
time it's a fish, not a monster
I need. Anyway,
    stop 'round here first
Requirement: Have completed
Yue's fifth quest: "I'm Having
Trouble with
    Someone"
Love Level: 5
Reward: Apple Pie

How to Complete: Talk to Yue.
Another chance to prove your
fishing skills. The fishes of
Alvarna are very appreciated in
others towns, so Yue will ask
you to catch a Char for her. You
can get this fish in Blessia
Island - Center. Go to the
farming area to the east and try
to fish in the little lake in
the left of the area. After
getting one, deliver it to Yue
and receive another Yue's
homemade food (yummy). If you
already have a Char beforehand,
you can give it to Yue at once.


Yue's Original Goods
--------------------------------
Description: I'm thinking' of
making something totally
original that will
    really make me stand out. Wa
Requirement: Have completed
Yue's sixth quest: "More Monster
Money!" Love Level: 6 Reward:
500G

How to Complete: Talk to Yue. As
a true traveler merchant Yue
wants to innovate and see if she
can have better luck selling
original goods made all by
herself with her look. For this
she decides to make her own
kimono (and, in my opinion it's
a good idea) with natural dyes,
so you need to take some colored
grasses (Red, Blue and Yellow
Grasses). There are 3 ways to
get them:
- As the most recommended option
farming area, pick the Blue
Grass just in the south part and
the Red Grass at right side, now
walk to the farming area in
Blessia Island - Center and take
the Yellow Grass at the left
side.
- If you already have these Gras
- Buy them all at Natalie's plac
Return and deliver them all to
Yue.


Yue's Original Goods (Continued)
--------------------------------
Description: I still need your
help with this! Requirement:
Have completed Yue's seventh
quest: "Yue's Original Goods"
Love Level: 7 Reward: Miso
Eggplant

How to Complete: Meet Yue at
Alvarna - West End and talk to
her. She finally completed her
kimono and will show it to you,
asking if you have any
suggestion or comments about it.
Since you don't know anything
about fashion, you will say to
ask Julia to help her. Just
after saying that, for a such
coincidence Julia will pass
through you (do you really
believe in that?) and will say
that she wants to buy one. To
thanks for the help Yue will
give a special discount to her,
selling the kimono for 30000G
instead 50000G (a little
expensive, just a little).


Help Me Find Something!
--------------------------------
Description: I did something
kind of silly... I think I might
have dropped
    something. Can you go get it
Requirement: Have completed
Yue's eighth quest: "Yue's
Original Goods
    (Continued)"
Love Level: 8
Reward: Critical Ring

How to Complete: Talk to Yue.
She wants to thank you for all
the help you gave to her in the
others quests and wants to give
a big present (so sweet), but
there is a little problem with
the present (good things never
come easy...). She lost it
somewhere on Blessing Island and
asks you to find it, since this
place is too dangerous for her.
So go to Blessia Island -
Alter/Old Ship, walk to the east
until the end of the beach and
you will find a ring laying on
the floor. Return and give to
her your own present (?) and
receive it as a prize for the
quest (???).

I've been wanting to tell you
for a while now.
    Come meet me?

How to Complete: Note: Take this
quest as the last one of the day
(needs 2 days to complete). Talk
to Yue. She wants you to take
her on a date (cute to see) and
ask to meet you in the next day.
Wait one day and find Yue,
talking to her after that. She
will ask a lot of things about
you, respond whatever you want,
but each answer can either match
Yue's likes, make her get a
little confused or just saying a
commentary about your like, so
to check each reaction, all
questions will follow this
model:

Yue's Question (1)Match Answer
(2)Funny Answer (3)Normal Answer

Yue: What kind of food do you
like, Kyle? (1)"Lighter foods."

7.7.22. Sera & Serena's Quests
        [Sera&Serena-Q2]
================================

Let's Play Hide-and-Seek!
--------------------------------
Description: Come play hide-and-
seek with us! Requirement: Talk
to them once. Friendship Level:
0 Reward: Marmalade

How to complete: Talk to Sera &
Serena. They'll invite you to
play hide-and-seek, so you need
to find them (they'll disappear
after you or they change the
map). They'll just keep moving
to different spots (I found them
at Alvarna - North Square next
where Yue stay in this map,
other time I found them walking
at De Sainte-coquille Park and
other at De Sainte-coquille
Dining Hall), so to remove all
doubts just cheat and ask to
Alicia to find them (the life
isn't always fair). Talk to them
and receive your prize. Sera &
Serena also tell that they love
this reward.


Come Play with Us!
--------------------------------
Description: We're looking for
someone to play with us!
Requirement: Have completed Sera
& Serena's first quest: "Let's
Play
    Hide-and-Seek!"
Friendship Level: 2
Reward: Chocolate Cookie

How to complete: Talk to Serena
(yes, only her) at Alvarna -
North Square. She'll explain
that she was playing hide-and-
seek with Sera, but can't find
her. Help Serena to find her
another half (too sad to see
only one of them). Go to Blessia
Island - Sandy Path and rescue
Sera there (Tortoises are still
in there). After talking to her
(for someone lost she has
courage to get back alone), go
meet them at Alvarna - North
Square and receive a half
present from Serena (Sera wants
the other half). Note: If you
start this quest and ask to
Alicia to locate the twins
(without meeting Serena before),
Sera will not be available to be
find anywhere, so Alicia says
she is Far-off City (like Yue
after AM 12:00).


Let's Play a Guessing Game!
--------------------------------
Description: We're looking for
someone to play with us!
Requirement: Have completed Sera
& Serena's second quest: "Come
Play with Us!" Friendship Level:
4 Reward: Pudding (right choice)
and Sardine Sashimi (wrong
choice)

How to complete: Talk to Sera &
Serena at Alvarna - North
Square. Sera will suggest to
play "Who's Who?" but will not
explain how to do that, so I'll
do that (as if someone really
need it, but anyway...). They
will start to walk in the same
place and after a while they
will ask who is Sera. Easy task,
if you pay attention at their
clothes, hair, you will see they
are pretty different. Sera have
the left eye uncover by her
hair, use her scarf at the right
side and have long sleeves with
a orange detail in the tip.
Serena have the right eye
uncover, use her scarf at the
left side and have a white cloth
at her shoulders.

To make this simple, the right
option is "Sera's on the left!"
and you will receive the best
prize. If you choose "Sera's on
the right!" Serena will say
you're wrong and Sera will ask
if you want to try again (if you
answer "No." the quest will be
abandoned, so you can redo
checking on the bulletin board
and if you answer "Sure!" they
will mix again). If you "I don't
have any idea!" the quest will
be over and you will get the
worst prize.


Something a Little More Grown Up
--------------------------------
Description: There's something
we've been wanting to do for a
while. Requirement: Have
completed Sera & Serena's third
quest: "Let's Play a Guessing
    Game!"
Friendship Level: 6 Reward: Sera
& Serena as girlfriends?

How to complete: Talk to Sera &
Serena. Serena will ask if you
like her (and after that Sera
will ask the same). If you
answer "No, not really..." for
one of them the quest will be
abandoned (you can start again
if you want), so answer "I like
you." to them both. Now they
will ask you to bring them the
Stoller Chalice and say to get
more information from Leann.
Meet her and she will explain
the story behind it, also
telling that her father Max have
bought it. Leann accept to
borrow it to you, so go to De
Sainte-coquille Dinning Hall and
walk straight to the wall in
front of the door's entrance to
find it. Now go meet Sera &
Serena, giving the Stoller
Chalice to them. Now they want
you to propose to them. After
that a day will pass.

********************************
7.8. Festivals [Festivals]
********************************

Festivals are a good opportunity
to increase friendship level
with the villagers, as talking
and giving gifts to them in
these dates have a stronger
effect on the friendship level
than usual days. Besides, you
can also enjoy the mini games in
the festivals and obtain prizes
from them as well as increase
friendship even more.

One interesting note about
festivals days is that it'll
never rain in these days, even
if you pay Alicia to do so.

Everybody is in a fixed position
over the map in festival days,
the table below shows where you
can find everybody (depending on
the festival they can change
they're positions, but if that
happens I'll tell where they'll
be instead):


 Villager Name | Location       
--------------------------------
 Alicia        | Alvarna - North
 Barrett.......|.Alvarna - Falli
 Byron         | De Sainte-coqui
 Cammy.........|.Alvarna - East 
 Cecilia       | Alvarna - North
 Dorothy.......|.Alvarna - Falli
 Douglas       | Alvarna Clinic 
 Egan..........|.Alvarna - East 
 Gordon        | Alvarna Clinic 
 Herman........|.De Sainte-coqui
 Jake          | Alvarna - Falli
 Julia.........|.Alvarna - Port.
 Leann         | Alvarna Academy
 Leonel........|.Alvarna Academy
 Mana          | Alvarna - North

 Roy           | Alvarna - East 
 Sera & Serena.|.Alvarna Academy
 Tanya         | Alvarna - Port 
 Yue...........|.Alvarna - Pond.

Note: When it start to becoming
dark all the villagers move to
their respective homes. Also,
after a couple get married they
won't appear anymore at the
festivals, they will spend all
day inside their house.
** In second generation all marr
(except Cecilia and Mana/Alicia
if they're your mother, they go
to De Sainte-coquille Park after
AM 09:00) and married guys will
come back to their original
places.

Below you'll see about the
festivals in this game. They'll
follow the model shown just
below:


Date - Festival Name
--------------------------------
Brief description of what's the
main idea of this festival.


Notes about this festival What
you should do in this festival.


Spring 1 - New Year's Day
--------------------------------
The first festival of the year
and the last festival you see
(since you only arrive in
Alvarna one day after it). A new
Year has come! Everything renews
in this day. Start to think your
plans for this year and prepare
for more work to do! Happy New
Year!


Notes about this festival No
special comments about this
festival. Everybody is in the
standard position and they only
say something about this day.
Just do your daily tasks as
usual.


Spring 13 - Flower Festival
--------------------------------
In this day of year, colored
papers are falling from the sky
in the city (like all the others
festivals). Some villagers are
talking about how beautiful
flowers are, other just want to
use the festival as an excuse to
drink in the afternoon (as Jake
say), and you can invite girls
to see the cherry blossoms under
the cherry tree and raise their
affections. Each girl make a
comment about a fact in her
life. If you want invite them
all (need to reset the game) to
see what they say (I decided to
not write about what they say
since it is better you to see
than read and also because I'm
lazy).


Notes about this festival Ok,
for know some things you should
know about this festival.
- Everybody is in the standard p
- You can invite any romantic in
- Walk to Cherry Blossom Square 
- Only the first three will acce
 second generation you can invit

 been with someone else and thei
 one level if you have just rais

I suggest to choose the girls
you like the most or the ones
who have the lowest love level
at the moment (for example
Rosalind, Alicia in the first
year since it is difficult to
get their favorite presents in
this time). For second
generation just invite everyone!


Spring 25 - Eating Contest
Festival
--------------------------------
As one of the most primitive
instincts of the humans, in this
festival you will eat as much as
possible to win the contest.
This is the most waited day for
Herman, so he can to show his
amazing abilities and do a
perfect judgment of the
tournament (or at least only to
see he isn't the only one who
can eat a lot). Some girls will
cheer for you to win the contest
(do they like a fluffy man?).


Notes about this festival
- Characters in different places
 of your house, Douglas and Gord
 Ray (second generation) will be
- Talk to Herman to start the co
 until 5:30 PM.
- When he says "Start!", press t
 until he says "Stop!".
- The rewards are:
    * Grand Prize (1st place) ge
  Formula A (first generation) /
    * Honorable Mention (2nd pla
  Pizza (second generation);
    * Consolation Prize (3rd pla
  (second generation).

If you want to win you need to
get at least 35 bites. Winning
will increase everybody
friendship and love points.


Summer 1 - 1st Day of Summer
--------------------------------
Finally the first day of summer!
The hot season which everyone
was waiting, mostly the kids,
since now everybody can swim.
The girls will say that they can
ready their swimsuits in the day
before it, so it's time for a
true man enjoy his life after a
long time working. Take a deep
breath, get out of your house
and meet the girls in the city
with their... daily clothes?
Yeah... that's all, they know
how to break a man's heart...


Notes about this festival There
isn't too much to comment about
this festival, it's just a
festival day without anything
particular, all villagers will
be at their fixed positions on
festival day and you don't need
to do nothing different the
usual. Boring day, very boring
day.


Summer 7 - Monster Taming
Festival
--------------------------------
A special day to strengthen and
get strengthen the ties between
humans (and some elves) and
monsters. With a brave and kind
heart, show your taming skill
(as Cecilia said: "You seen like
the type of person who is meant
to tame the land and its
monsters.") as the Earthmate
Master, impressing everyone in
town. To do that, follow the
below instruction.


Notes about this festival
- Characters in different places
 of your house, Max and Jake (fi
 (second generation) will be in 
- You need to complete Cecilia's
 the item Pet Glove, essential t
- You need at least a barn and o
- Talk to Herman to start the co
 until 5:30 PM.
- This contest is a competition 
 specific monster, Herman will a
  to catch a specific monster.
- The rewards are:
    * Grand Prize (1st place) ge
  Formula B (first generation)/ 
  (second generation);
    * Honorable Mention (2nd pla
  Union Stew (second generation)
    * Consolation Prize (3rd pla
  Eggplant (second generation).

Note: At least in my version of
game there is a bug in this
festival. If you want to win
this festival you need to catch
the monsters before the hour
counter in the internal clock of
the game changes. For example if
you talk to Herman at 8:XX you
need to catch the monster before
it turns 9:00, so I suggest you
to start this contest at the
first minutes of a new hours (if
you talk to Herman at X:59 and
don't use cheat or glitch you'll
automatically lose the 1st
place, as it's impossible to
tame a monster in less than 1
minute).


Summer 19 - Dance Festival
--------------------------------
Time to take a break and forget
all your hard work. This
festival is a good opportunity
to ask your favorite girl out to
a dance and show that you can be
more than a farmer (or
adventurer, or blacksmith, or
hunter, or whatever you are) and
impress her with your amazing
moves (better than some of
previous games) with a warm
music in the background. In my
opinion, everybody should stay
in the same place to see the
couples dancing, somewhere
beautiful like the Cherry
Blossom Square, but probably
that would lag a lot, so sad...


Notes about this festival
- Everybody is in the standard p
- You can only dance with potent
  with Love Level 4 or above.
- You can dance only with one gi

I suggest to choose the
character you most like or who
have the lowest love level at
the moment.


Summer 25 - Fishing Contest (1st
generation) / Big Cook-Off (2nd
generation)
--------------------------------
Fishing is the perfect sport to
relax in a sunny and comfortable
day of summer (at least for some
people). For others "Fishing is
a fierce, heroic battle. A match
between person and fish. A
gladiatorial contest where your
wits will earn you glorious
victory or crushing defeat." as
Rosalind said. If you want to
dedicate to such a finest art
you need a lot of concentration,
a good bait and years of
training to develop your own
technique. But I trust in the
main character abilities, since
he/she can fish a completely
polished stone with a rod as I,
personally, would never be able
to do the same. In the second
generation this festival will be
changed to a Cook Contest, so
you can show to everyone in town
your amazing cook skills.


Notes about this festival
- Characters in different places
 of your house, Barrett and Doro
 Leann (second generation) will

  Formula C (first generation) /
 Big Knife (second generation);
    * Honorable Mention (2nd pla
  Sleeping Bag (second generatio
    * Consolation Prize (3rd pla
  (second generation).

If you want to win, catch at
least a Sardine level 5 (18 cm).
You can fish them at Alvarna -
East End, Alvarna - West End,
Alvarna - Port and Blessia
Island - Summer Isle Port (first
generation). To win in the Big
Cook-Off you need to prepare a
Seafood Pizza level 5 or over,
check the Cooking Section for
further information about this
and how make one at this level.


Fall 1 - Adventure Contest
--------------------------------
Every man in the land need to
prove your true value to the
mankind and this is the perfect
chance to do it! (ok, in the
truth it's just an event where
everyone can have some fun).
Time to prepare your true
adventurer's spirit hidden
somewhere in your heart and
complete countless challenges in
the way of your life (in this
case just find a stone). Poor
Natalie/Ray, in festivals like
this one she/he needs to do some
extra works...


Notes about this festival

If you want to win, find the
item before the hours counter
change three times after you
started this competition. For
example, if you start this quest
at 8:XX AM (XX can variate from
00 to 59), you need to find the
item before it turns 11:00 AM
(10:59 AM still win).


Fall 13 - Harvest Festival
--------------------------------
A traditional festival in
Harvest Moon series. This day
everybody celebrates and shows
your grateful for the gifts of
the land, our daily food. As a
farmer, it is your duty to give
a special thanks for the grace
of the soil that we are able to
keep farming. Some villagers
also comments how delicious is
the vegetables from your farm
and praises for your hard work.


Notes about this festival No
special comments about this
festival. Everybody is in the
standard position and they only
say something about this day.
Just do your daily tasks as
normal.


Fall 25 - Monster Contest
--------------------------------
After you win the title of
"Monster Master" at the Monster
Taming Festival, it is your
destiny to get the other title
of "Monster Master", but now in
Monster Contest. An alliance
between humans and monsters
don't end after you manage to
tame one, but only after you get
more close this ties, with much
affection and training every
single day (and many more
brushes), raising the trust of
this two different races. Bring
your best friend (the most
powerful in this case) to the
contest and get another prize to
your collection (not a very
important one, but still a
prize).


Notes about this festival

    * Participation Prize (3rd p
  (second generation).

Herman always says that your
reward is a Health It, but check
your backpack to see the true
prize, also sometimes the game
will give you randomly the 2nd
place or the 3rd place if you
presents a monster with a
strength below than 45, ignoring
the rule I have explained
before. In second generation at
least in my game version I used
a Pomme Pomme level 0 and I
still win the first place, so I
don't know if this is a bug or
you always win this festival.

*Approximates values, I only tes


Winter 7 - Shooting Star
Festival
--------------------------------
In this day the stars make the
sky more beautiful. As everybody
knows, a wish made upon a
shooting star will come true, so
don't lose your only chance in a
year (two chances if you do
Cecilia's quest "Company for
Stargazing", but that isn't
important and I don't think
anyone pay attention in what I
say in those first lines of each
festival...). Call your favorite
girl and enjoy this beautiful
moment together.


Notes about this festival
- Everybody is in the standard p
- You can only see the stargazin

time. You already proof your

this entire year and check your
goals for the next one. Walk

the good (sometimes bad) moments
with all villagers and
everything you received in this
friendly town called Alvarna.
Best wishes for the coming year
to everybody.

festival. Everybody is in the
standard position and they only
say something about this day.
Just do your daily tasks as
normal.


********************************
7.9. Villagers [Villagers]
********************************

In this section you'll find some
info about the villagers in this
game. The subsections include
what gift you can give him/her
to increase (or decrease) the
friendship level, when is
his/her birthday and finally a
brief section about the
bachelorettes you can marry in
the first generation.

To enter freely at people's
house you need to have at least
Friendship Level 3 with the
ownership of the place.


================================
7.9.1. Villager Likes/Dislike
       [Likes]
================================

Here you'll see what each
villager like/dislike and
therefore what you can give
him/her as a gift if you want to
increase/decrease his/her
Friendship Level.

Notice that you can only give
one present a day for each
person. Giving a lot of them in
the same day doesn't change
anything and it'll be a waste.
Additionally, be careful when
giving the gifts, see if you're
really giving only one unit of
the item and not a group of
them, as this too is not
different than giving only one
unit.

       Generation [Schedule2]
================================

In second generation, new
characters will appear in the

new different routine In the
particular case of your mother,
she'll have the same schedule

find her, she will be at your
home. So these are their new
schedule (also note the same

*Note: If Kyle gets married with

life in second generation can

================================
7.9.5. Bachelorettes - First
       Generation
       [Bachelorettes]
================================

About Marriage: If you want to
get married, you need to raise
the Love Level of the girl you
want to marriage up to 10 and
give the proposal item to her
(if you complete all the
requirements, you can ask her in
marriage at any moment, include
in festivals day). Also you can
wait until the default wedding
day of the girl you like and
confess to her during the
ceremony (yes, you can steal the
fiance, but only works if you
don't have married with another
girl and have her Love Level
10), but your friendship with
her ex-partner will drop. Don't
work with Alicia, Mana and Yue
as they don't have a default
marriage. Also when you give to
her the Proposal Item, the
wedding will automatically start
in the next day (so do all your
daily tasks before that). After
the ceremony, another day will
pass and both of you will start
the day at your home. You lose a
entire day at other villagers
weddings days (if you go to the
bed in a wedding day it you
occurs at the day you try to
move out of your house).

================================
7.9.6. Love Candidates - Second
       Generation [Love]
================================

As the main character in the
second generation part of the
game isn't a fully grown person
yet, he/she cannot get married
at his/her age, but that doesn't
mean he/she can't date and have
a celebration with the special
someone he/she likes.

Because there's no actual
marriage, opposite from before,
as a child you can "marry" as
many candidates you want (once
each, obviously) and don't need
to worry about losing quests
from others or anything like
that. The "marriages" also don't
have proposal items, the
celebration will always be
triggered by the last quest of
the candidate. All you need to
do is to take the quest and,
after talking to the requester,
answer whether you really like
him/her or not. In the negative
case, nothing really happens and
you can take the quest again, if
you want. On the other hand, if
you say you do like him/her,
you'll be in the church in the
next day and a marriage will
occur the same as it happened in
the first generation, except
that no one talks to you after
the event and you won't live
together. In fact, after the
event, everybody will act as if
nothing happened at all and
nothing will change.

About the candidates. As you can
choose if you want to be a male
or female character in the
second generation, obviously
there are candidates for both
genres. I'll list below the
possible choices, starting by
the girls and then the boys.

8. Monsters                     
################################

The monster are assumed to be on
Friendship Level 0.

Every monster is a Fighting-Type
monster implicitly, so when I
say a monster is, for example, a
Farming-Type monster I actually
mean he's a Farming-Type AND a
Fighting-Type monster. On the
other hand, when I say a monster
is a Fighting- Type monster that
means he's ONLY a Fighting-Type
and can't help you on your farm
or produce anything.

The produce cycle from Produce
Type monster is 3 days after you
capture it (except Wolly, which
you can take small fleece just
after capturing one), that means
every 3 days you can gather the
productions from them.

Also the Produce-Type Monster
will produce item at low quality
while friendship Level is
between 0 - 3, medium quality
between 4 - 7 and high quality
between
8 - 10

The first table below shows the
basic model of how the monster
info is disposed:

--------------------------------
Description: The info you can
see in the game about the
monster Found in: What dungeon
you can find this monster (time
of the day it'll appear:

(farm, fight, produce or ride)
Item Dropped: The item you can
obtain by defeating this monster

********************************
8.1. Monster Taming [Taming]
********************************

In this game, you're allowed to
tame the monsters you find in
the dungeons and this way you
can, besides collecting them,
tame monsters that can help on
your farm activities (harvest
and watering) or that can
produce goods for selling (eggs,
milk, wool, etc.). Notice all of
the monsters also can accompany
when you go to dungeons and
fight by your side against other
monsters.

Before you start to tame
monsters, you'll have to build a
barn in the village, so that the
new tamed monsters can live
there. You can do this by
talking to the mayor after
completing Cecilia's first quest
("Please Find Something") and
receiving the Pet Glove. If you
want to build the barn you'll
need 5000G and 50 pieces of
wood.

In order to be able to tame
monsters, you'll need the Pet
Glove, received from Cecilia
after you complete her first
quest. After you put your hands
in this glove, you'll be able to
tame monsters by equipping the
glove and then petting the
monsters in the dungeons with
it. Notice the monsters will
still attack you while you try
to pet them. In order to finish
the taming, keep petting the
monster until the a new window
appears asking for you to give a
name for your new partner.

*Each pet only counts if some he
likes you more.

The info about the pet glove is
just below:


Pet Glove
--------------------------------
What is it for: Taming wild
monsters to help you. How to
get: Reward from Cecilia after
finishing the quest "Please Find
    Something".
Description: Gloves that tell
your monsters you truly care.
Now you can laugh off those
loving nips and bites.


********************************
8.2. Monster Care [Care]
********************************

After you tame a monster, it's
important to take good care of
it. By doing so, you'll be
rewarded by being able to
collect better productions from
them and increasing their
fighting abilities. So, just to
make it clear, by taking good
care of your monsters, you'll
increase their friendship level
toward you and, by doing so,
you'll not only increase their
status (HP, Attack, etc.) but
also that will make them produce
higher quality (bigger) items
that are worth more.

So, what should you do to take
care of monsters? Well, first of
all, you need to feed them
everyday. Not doing so will
cause its friendship level to
fall (it won't die or anything,
don't worry). If you want to
feed a monster, all you need to
do is to get some Feed (an item)
and toss it in the hole outside
the barn. You can toss a lot of
feed at once, you don't need to
do this every day. Each monster
in the barn will eat one Feed a
day automatically, you just need
to make sure there is enough
food in the barn for all of
them. You can see how much feed
there is by reading the sign
just outside the barn.

You can get Feed in two ways:
you can buy it from Douglas for
400G each (very expensive!), or
you can buy some grass seeds and
plant them in your farm, wait
for they to grow and cut them
with your sickle. The latter is
a much better option, so I'd
recommend you to start planting
grass as soon as possible if you
want to tame some monsters. You
won't need to plant a lot of
grass at all. After it grows
once, you can cut it to collect
Feed and, after that, they'll
regrow in three days again,
allowing you to collect again.
This cycle is always repeated,
so you won't need to buy more
grass seeds each time you cut
them. Just DON'T CUT THE GRASS
TWICE IN A ROW, that is, before
it regrows because, by doing
this, you'll really kill the
grass and you'll need to plant
them again. Notice each tile of
grass you cut generates 4 Feed,
what means that if you cut a 3x3
area of grass you'll obtain 36
Feeds, not only 9 so, since the
grass regrows each 3 days, one
single 3x3 area of grass allows
you to feed 36 / 3 = 12 monsters
forever, as long as you keep the
grass regrowing. Notice as well
that, after you cut the grass,
it'll go to the barn and become
Feed automatically, so all you
need to do is to cut it in your
farm and don't need to toss them
in the hole of the barn.

Now retaking the care of
monsters point, besides feeding
them, it's important to brush
them everyday to make them
happier as well. This isn't
necessary at all and won't
affect their happiness if you
don't do this, but doing so you
increase their friendship much
faster. You can do this by
equipping your brush (see below
how to get it) and pressing the
tools button next to a monster.

Finally, I'll list below the
caring tools you can obtain and
what they're for, how you can
get them and the description
about them you can see in the
game:

monsters and increase their

    very nutritious milk.


********************************
8.3. Bosses                     
********************************

In the second generation, each
dungeon will have a guardian
boss at the last map you could
access as Kyle. To collect all
Tablet Fragments and open new
weapons at Tanya's store, it's
indispensable to defeat them
all. In this section I will
explain to you all move sets
from each boss and how to defeat
them. After taking down a lot
the boss hp, it will enter in a
berserk/near death state and
change its colors and new
attacks will come.

You need to kill them in the
season order (first killing the
spring guardian, and then the
summer guardian and so on),
because the next boss will not
appear until you defeat the
previous one. Also you need to
fight alone (no monster pet can
go with you) Also note, the name
of attacks is only based in what
I see, so none of them are
official.

I started to try to kill the
spring boss at level 10 and
proceeded until the winter boss
at level 20 so it's possible to
defeat them at a low level but
it can be a little difficult
since some attacks can kill you
in one hit (also all damage from
attacks are based in these low
level, what means that, at a
higher level the same attacks
can do damages close to 1). For
the secret bosses I start to
kill the first one at level 30.

The only weapon I really don't
recommend are hammers since
bosses don't take knock back and
the critical from an axe is a
lot of better. Longswords have a
long delay and take more time to
make 2 moves and axes can do a
great damage in critical but
have a delay to start and do an
average damage in normal hits.
If you're not good enough to
avoid most of attacks try to use
sword and shield to raise your
defense. I recommend spears the
most, so you can attack from a
safe distance and do a good
damage or shortswords since the
delay of each attack is really
short, except the last move
since it opens your guard for a
great amount of time, so pay
attention. About rods you can
use the spells from a safe
distance and attack when the
boss open its guard, but it can
be a little more difficult to
aim and you will normally have
only one chance to attack in
each opening. Since my magic
level was too low I didn't use
any spells to defeat the bosses.

For all bosses you can bring
potions to recover HP and
Invinciroid/Formuade (choose
only one of them, they cancel
each other), so you can give a
good boost in your stats for the
battle. Also check the Boss
attribute and create the best
equips (see Forging Section for
further informations) against
it.

*HP values are an approximation.


Trieste Forest Dungeon Guardian
- Terror Tree
--------------------------------
HP: 1000 Berserk Mode: 250 HP
left Attribute: Earth (Use wind
type attacks for extra damage)

Attack List:

- Root Spike: The boss raises bo
 in this move. Roots will grow u
 can also stuns you. This attack
- Swing Attack: Raises right arm
 damage (the most powerful from 
- Apples Falls: Put both hands t
 line of apples will appear from
 attack repeats 3 times in a row
- Circle of Apples: The boss wil
 eyes turns red. Eight apples wi
 into you. Low damage.
- Cure: Embrace itself and recov
- Rush: Berserk Attack Type. Aft
 your direction and stop for a f
 Continuous attack and low damag

Strategy:

As soon as you regain the
character control, just keep
running in the map to avoid the
Root Spike Attack. After that,
run and try to go behind the
boss from any side and attack
from this spot. Any weapon
should work well in this boss as
he can't move. Even if it tries
the Swing Attack, this spot is
out from its range, so just keep
attacking. It will also try to
attack you with Apples Falls,
try to avoid 3 times by walking
to right/left or just take the
hit, as it only inflicts little
damage. If it attacks with
Circle of Apples, you can choose
to take the damages or try to
move to the middle of the map
and avoid them by walking to the
sides. After avoiding (or taking
damage) just return to the
safety spot and attack again,
repeating the cycle. When its HP
goes low and it turns purple,
the boss will start the Rush
attack, you can avoid this and
hit 2 times its back, avoid
again and keep doing this until
you finally kill it.


Blessia Island Dungeon Guardian
- Octopirate
--------------------------------
HP: 1500 Berserk Mode: 380 HP
left Attribute: Fire (Use water
type attacks for extra damage)

Attack List:

- Spike Balls: A spike ball will
 this in you. It flies toward yo
 crossing half of the map distan
- Thrust: The Octopirate will mo
 its tentacles. Can inflict 4 hi
 faster and follow you. Low dama
- Spear Attack: It will raise it
 it will attack you 3 times, if 
 the same quantity of damage you
- Barrel Throw: It will raise it
 eyes will turn yellow and it'll
 direction that explode with the
 barrel) and repeat this attack 
- Tentacle Swing: Raise the midd
 stun. Low damage.
- Smoke Attack: Berserk Attack T
 spit a lot of little black smok
 take a lot of them if you stay 

Strategy:

First avoid the Spike Balls by
just getting out of his vision.
After an attack, the Octopirate
will come with a Thrust, so it
will always follow this sequence
of moves (a random attack,
thrust, random attack,
thrust...), try to attack as
much as you can when it's in the
middle of a thrust attack
(shortswords are highly
recommended) and always attack
from its sides (behind attacks
don't have effect because of its
hard shell and front attacks are
too dangerous). If you see it
preparing a Barrel Throw, take a
distance from it and try to run
to any side, avoiding the
barrels, and pay attention to
the explosions (it can still
damage you). In the case you see
it preparing a Spear Attack just
run to its side and attack. Keep
fighting until it enters in
berserk mode. When it turns all
red, stay close and get out of
the front its face (try to stay
exactly at its side. After the
it uses the smoke attack, try to
hit it twice and then wait it
turns to you and then move to
its side again. Repeat it until
you kill the Octopirate.


Messhina Valley Dungeon Guardian
- Bane Dragon
--------------------------------
HP: 2000 Berserk Mode: 500 HP
left Attribute: Wind (Use earth
type attacks for extra damage)

Attack list:

- Tongue Whip: The boss shakes i
 damage but causes paralysis (ve
- Rush: It will move back one st
 10 squares). Medium to high dam
- Energy Balls: Eyes turn blue. 
 its mouth and will come in zigz
- Vanish: When you and the Bane 
 the map.
- Seal Blow: It will come after 
 its eyes will turn blue, and it
 Medium to high damage (depends 
- Body Smashing: After a Seal Bl
 orange and it jumps in the same
 dead end (after Seal Blow) caus
 it. In Berserk Mode, it will al
 damage.

Strategy:

Run all the bridge until near
the end (pay attention to not
run towards it during the Rush
Attack). Now you have two ways
to defeat it:

- First Way: When you see it pre
the Bane Dragon near the point
where it stops (near 10 squares
of distance). Always attack two
times (use the max range of the
weapon when doing this) and
prepare for the next attack
hint. If you see it preparing
Tongue Whip, just run until you
can't see its face and
counterattack. If you see an
Energy Balls attack coming, you
can move the same amount of
space you would if you were to
avoid a rush attack and then
come back to see the next attack
(don't have enough time for a
counterattack) or stay 2 squares
away from its mouth, wait the
ball to move and walk in its
direction to avoid the ball and
repeat the process 2 more times
(need a good timing to do this)
and then attack twice. When you
reach the dead end with the Bane
Dragon, it will vanish and
appear from left or right, when
you see it, move to the other
side. After the attack, move
away from the dead end, wait the
Body Smashing and attack twice.

Repeat all the process again
until it gets in Berserk Mode.
Now the boss will only use Rush
and Body Smashing, Rush and Body
Smashing during all the bridge.
After a Rush, attack it once,
run to avoid the Body Smashing,
go back, attack twice, run to
avoid Rush, repeat the process
until you reach the dead end.
Use the dead end tactic and keep
doing this until you finally
kill it.

- Second Way: The easiest way to
to the dead end and wait the
boss reaches there. It will
Vanish and use the Seal Blow. As
the first way, run to the other
side from where it appears and,
after the attack, turn your back
in the dead end direction (stay
close it) and when you see the
boss jumping, start a complete
combo of your weapon as soon as
it touches the ground (you won't
get hit by the impact). Move
back to avoid the second Body
Smashing and repeat the cycle
until you can't do a complete
combo (it'll turn back faster
and if you keep doing this
tactic you won't ever kill the
boss). This time after the Seal
Blow, it'll run to the opposite
side of the dead end and enter
in Berserk Mode. Lure the Giant
Lizard to the other dead end and
repeat the process again until
you finally kill it for all.

Also note you can combine the
both ways, so you don't need to
wait and lure the boss to the
dead end.


Padova Mountains Dungeon
Guardian - Crystal Mammoth

type attacks for extra damage)

Strategy:

Dodge the first Rush attack and
stay close to it. You can do
this anywhere, but I suggest to
lure the Crystal Mammoth to the
center of the map, this way is
much easier to avoid his Snout
Swing than from the corners.
After the Rush attack wait the
Snout Swing hint, move to its
left side and do a complete
combo with your weapon if you
can. Wait again the Snout Swing
attack, attack again, repeat all
the cycle. Keep doing this
tactic, moving around it
(counterclockwise). When you see
all crystals in its back
shining, starts to pay
attention. The Crystal Mammoth
will raise its snout and prepare
the Crystal Barriers. Stay away
from it and wait until the
barriers starts to disappear.
Get closer and start the cycle
again (avoid the Snout Swing and
do a complete combo...). When it
enters in Berserk Mode, run away
from the Rush Attack and then
try to come closer. The Crystal
Mammoth will try a Body
Smashing, run away (but don't go
too far), go back and attack
once with a shortsword (the
delay of other weapons can be
too long, but you can try if you
want). It will try the same
attack again, so just keep
running and attacking once.
Maybe in a certain moment you'll
see your actions will be a
little slower than its attack,
so just wait two attacks from it
and get the timing again. Be
extremely careful, one hit from
a Body Smashing can stun you and
open your guard to a complete
Rush Attack and that can mean
your death. If you get too far
away from it, it will try to
Rush again in your direction or
use the Vacuuming (in this case
just run for the opposite side).
Wait until it stops and try to
come closer again. Continue the
hit-and-run tactic until you
kill it.


Palermo Shrine Dungeon Guardian
- Fiersome
--------------------------------
HP: 3000 Berserk Mode: 750 HP
left Attribute: Fire (Use water
type attacks for extra damage)

Attack List:

- Stomp: Fiersome starts to fly,
 fall down. Only the yellow fire
 can cause stun. In Berserk Mode
  the ground and move forward.
- Triple Fireball: It will raise
 your direction and can change t
 damage.
- Fireball Vacuum: Shakes its he
 absorbs giant fireballs from an
- Spin Attack: Fiersome raises i
high damage and can cause stun.
- Fireball Tornado: Berserk Atta
 (one opposite to another) and s
 very high damage (depends on ho
 instant kill if you are in a lo
- Homing Fireball: Berserk Attac
 aiming wherever you go. Shoots 
 Medium to high damage.


Strategy:

For this fight come prepared
with Icifier (level 10) or a
better shortsword if you can
(need to have a lot of more
attack since Icifier has the
water element advantage), and
some strong potions or Cure
magic book completely restored.
I fought with Fiersome at level
26, so it's possible to kill it
(but some attacks kill me
instantly, so maybe you need
some tries until you can finish
it). Now use Dragon Break as
soon as the fight start (it will
decrease his defense and
attack), wait Fiersome to fly
over your head, run to a medium
distance to avoid the Stomp and
attack him three times. Now pay
attention to the attack hints:

- If it starts to fly again (Sto
arena, avoid it and attack twice
or, if it tries to smash you in
other parts of the map, you can
attack three times, but in both
cases keep a medium distance or
you will get a hit from its next
attack in the middle of your
combo.

- When Fiersome returns to the c
head, showing a Fireball Vacuum
attack coming ahead. Go to the
left or right side (the one that
will give you more space to see
from where the fireballs comes),
pay attention to the fireballs
coming in your direction and try
to avoid them. You can hit it
twice after the vacuum stop, but
if you want to be safer, just
attack once.

- In the case of Fiersome raises
the Triple Fireball. Try to run
away from it to any side and
when you see all Fireballs, get
out of the way and run back to
Fiersome. You can also try to
avoid by other ways, you just
need to know that this attack
moves forward and turns 90 to
the side you try to avoid (an
"L" movement). You can hit it
twice if you are in a medium
distance.

- If you hear a scream after Fie
distance and keep watching the
Spin Attack, so you can keep a
safe distance from it (this is a
very slow movement). Try to run
horizontally to have more space.
Attack twice and run to the
other side (if it uses the Spin
attack again and you stay in the
same place, you won't have more
space to run, taking almost all
the hits).

Try to follow these hints until
Fiersome enters in Berserk Mode.
Now it'll have a new set of
attacks and some previous
attacks will be a little
different. Spin Attack will be
the same, so do the same as
before. Triple Fireball and
Fireball Vacuum will be no
longer used. Also try to kill it
as fast as you can, because some
attacks can be very dangerous
and difficult to avoid. Now I
will list the new attacks and
how to avoid them:

- The Stomp starts in the same w
pillars that rises from the
ground and moves away from
Fiersome. Run to a medium
distance and after you
understand the fire pattern,
just go through them and attack
twice (you can hit three times
if you are fast enough). BUT if
it flies to the center of the
map, don't attack and be ready
for Fireball Tornado Attack.

- Like Fireball Vacuum, the hint
Stomp at the center of map). The
deadliest attack, it will shots
two lines of fireballs, rotating
counterclockwise. Go to the
extreme southeast corner. You
can use Cure magic book or some
healing item if you get hit
during this time.

- If you see Fiersome doing the 
and no scream), try to move to
its side, so the Homing Fireball
will make a curve. Now keep
running in circles until it
stops following you.

Keep doing these tactics until
you finally kill it and enjoy
the first ending.


Green Underground Shrine Dungeon
Guardian - Greater Demon
--------------------------------
HP: 3200
Berserk Mode: 800 HP left
Attribute: -

Attack List:

- Impact: Close range attack. Th

- Rush: Used when it is far from

 take) and can cause stun.
- Stone Spike: Berserk Attack Ty
 activated at medium range and G
 stones spikes will come from th
 dodge and get hit by one of the
 Medium damage (one spike) and c

Strategy:

One of the easiest bosses, so
easy that is possible to kill it
without getting hit by a single
attack. Just get closer to it
and wait for an attack. If you
see the Greater Demon raising
its arm for Impact or Triple
Power Wave attacks, just run to
its side until you see it can't
hit you anymore and give an
incomplete combo of your
currently weapon (don't use the
last hit or you'll be open for a
second attack). If you see it
preparing a Rush attack, go as
far as you can, get out of the
way and get closer again and
repeat the same tactic. After it
enters in Berserk Mode, keep
doing the same tactic, the only
difference is that if you see
the Greater Demon raising its
right arm you'll need to keep
running on the map until you
dodge all the five spikes from
Stone Spike Attack, but don't
attack this time, just wait for
the next one.


Tropic Underground Shrine
Dungeon Guardian - Chimera
--------------------------------
HP: 3200
Berserk Mode: 800 HP
Attribute: -

Attack List:

- Bite: Chimera will shake its h
 direction and biting three time
 front paws and jumps even farth
 cause stun.
- Paralyze Blow: Chimera will ru
 will glow blue and then blow gr
 damage.
- Water Laser: Chimera will run,
 lasers into your direction with
- Scratch: Close range attack. S
 left arm and scratches. Medium 

Strategy:

This boss basically likes to use
counter attacks. If it tries to
attack first, it'll try to hit
using the Bite attack. So just
wait it prepares the attack and
move out of the way, going to
any side. Now try to attack it.
If Chimera just turns to your
direction, move to its side and
attack once (can attack twice if
you are fast enough). If it
starts to run away, follow it
and prepare yourself against a
counter attack. There are two
possible attacks that can come
now. If you see Chimera facing
you with blue eyes, dodge the
Paralyze blow by going to its
side and do an incomplete combo
(don't use the last hit or
you'll be open for a second
attack). If you see it giving
its back toward your direction,
keep running around it until you
see the first shot and attack
twice with a shortsword or once
with other weapon. In the case
you get a status ailment or need
to heal just go far from it,
dodge the bite attack and use
this time to cure yourself.
After it enters in Berserk Mode,
the Bite attack will be a little
different and Chimera will use
the Paralyze Blow and Water
Laser at will (not as a counter
anymore). For me the battle
become easier at this point
because I didn't need to pursuit
it anymore and had more time to
inflict more hits. Just do the
same as before (pay attention to
the attacks hints) until you
finally kill it.


Ravine Underground Shrine
Dungeon Guardian - Golum
--------------------------------
HP: 1800
Berserk Mode: 450 HP left
Attribute: -

Attack list:

- Double Punch: Quickly puts the
 careful, because this is a fast
 can cause stun.
- Rush: The boss goes down on kn
 rushes after you . Low to mediu
- Fireball: Golum moves its left
 magic level 3. Medium to high d
- Storm Punch: Berserk Attack Ty
 knees, lowers its shoulder, sho
 sides and its hands will start 
 direction. Medium damage and gi
- Rocket Punch: Berserk Attack T
 rockets in the shape of hands i
 and following you. Medium damag

Strategy:

A boring fight. Golum has a high
physical defense and its attacks
don't give too much time for
counter attacks, so I really
recommend you to use Magic
attacks. If you choose this way,
try to use multi-hit magics at
max level, like Sonic Wind,
Fireball, Water Laser, but I
really recommend to use Shine
(do the same strategy described
below, but use the magic instead
a physical attack). Get closer
to it so Golum will not use the
Fireball (but if you see it
using this attack, just run away
a little from it since the range
of the magic is short). If you
see the boss preparing a Double
Punch, avoid it by going to its
side and attack twice with
shortsword (once with other
weapons). If you see a Rush
attack, run as far as you can
since Golum can reach you really
quickly (it can rush from one
wall to another of the map) and
attack twice (sometimes you can
attack three times) in its back
when Golum is stopping. Avoid to
fight near the walls, as you
can't dodge very well from its
attack. If you get hit, try to
go away from it and get healed
as soon as you can. Keep doing
this until it enters Berserk
Mode. Now two new attack will
come and only fireball attack
will remain from previous set of
moves. If you see Golum raising
its hand, keep moving around
until all hands disappears and
wait for the next attack. If it
tries to hit you with the Storm
Punch attack, wait until it
completely stop and attack three
times (attack twice if you reach
it too late). Just do it until
you see its end.


Iceberg Underground Shrine
Dungeon Guardian - Grimoire
--------------------------------
HP: 3500 Berserk Mode: 900 HP
left Attribute: Wind (Use earth
type attacks for extra damage)

Attack List:

- Tail Sweep: The boss opens its
 hitting you with its tail. High
- Stomp: Grimoire starts to fly,
 High damage.
- Gust: Start to move its wings 
 and hitting some times. Low dam
- Sonic Wind: Berserk Attack Typ
 Sonic Wind spells that keep fol
 attack, it moves in small turns

Strategy:

Spears can be a good choice in
this battle, but as always, a
shortsword can do a fine job
either. Try to lure the Grimoire
to the center of the map (since
it's easier to hit and avoid its
attack) when you see it flying
to perform the Stomp Attack,
attack twice. If you see
Grimoire moving its body to
left, move away to avoid the
Tail Sweep, go to its back and
do an incomplete combo (don't
use the last hit or you'll be
open for a second attack). If
you see it performing the Gust
attack, simply get out of the
way and attack it from its side
or back with long range attacks
(that's why I said that spears
are a good choice for this
battle), don't get too near of
Grimoire or you'll be push back
with its Gust. When you finally
do enough damage and it enters
in Berserk Mode just keep the
same strategy as before. The
difference now is that Grimoire
doesn't use Gust anymore, using
the Sonic Wind instead. If you
see it raising its body, three
wind razors will try to hit you.
Avoid the first move and hit it
twice. Now keep moving and in
the map to avoid the razors and
dodge the other moves. Keep
attacking the same way as before
(but now pay extra attention to
the razors).


################################
9. Dungeons [Dungeons1]
################################

In this section you'll know more
about each of the dungeons
available in this game. I'll
give a brief description about
each of them and list the
monsters and what you can get
from them. The dungeons are
ordered by the season order from
the game.

After the general info about the
dungeon, the Details for Area
subsection presents everything
there is in each of the areas of
the dungeon that could be
interesting to know.

Each dungeon has an ASCII map
that can help you to identify
the areas of the map. This can
be useful for reference for the
the quests of the villagers.

Unlike the first Rune Factory
game, in this one all of the
dungeons are opened and can be
accessed since the beginning of
the game. All of them starts
with weak monsters (even though
some are easier than others, see
the difficulty level of each one
in their sections below). During
the first generation of the
game, you'll see a lot of paths
will be blocked by fences and
statues. Well, you can't really
get past these for now, that
will only be possible after you
have your children and start
playing the second generation,
so that means the possibilities
are very limited in the
beginning of the game.

There are 4 dungeons in this
game, and each one provides a
fixed season during the whole
year, so you can use the soil in
them to plant crops that aren't
allowed to be planted in your
farm when your not in the
correct season for the crop.

One thing you should know about
the soil in the dungeons is that
sometimes you'll see a purple
round mark in one or more of the
farming squares. If you do see
one, don't step on it! As you'll
be poisoned if you walk on it.
This venom won't go out by
itself, so, if you want to get
rid of it, you'll need to buy a
Neutral Agent from Natalie in
the village clinic and toss it
on the poison. By doing that,
you'll vanish it for good and
you'll be able to plant seeds
there again, if you want.

Another interesting thing to
notice is that when you walk
around in any of dungeons,
sometimes you'll find some white
flowers growing on the ground
(not on farming soil). If you
cut these flowers, either by
using the sickle or a sword or
whatever, they'll drop a rune
orb. These work the same way as
the orbs generated by fully
grown crops, except that theses
ones are less effective, that
is, they'll restore only a small
amount of RP when you pick them.
Either way they can be useful,
so make sure to collect them
every time you see one and your
RP bar is not full. The flowers
grow once a day and don't regrow
by just changing screens, so if
you already cut it one day
you'll have to wait until the
next day.

10. Dungeons - Second Generation
    [Dungeons2]
################################

In the second generation your
character will mention that
grownups are too big to get
through the fences, but you can
get through, so you will have
access to different maps in
dungeons. Some paths are blocked
by strange statues and Kyle
couldn't do nothing about this,
but his child can read it and
get a hint as how to remove the
statue from the way, so just do
what it wants and you'll be able
to pass freely in the way behind
it. Also you'll be rewarded with
a Stone Tablet Fragment. The
Details for Area section will
say what you need to deliver or
do and open your path.

After you defeat Fiersome at
Palermo Shrine, slabs at all
Underground Shrine Entrances
(the room behind the last statue
of each dungeon) will be active,
so you will have access to the
secret seasonal rooms and bosses
(you can't take a monster with
you in these places). All of
them have nine room and, in
order to go to the next one you
need to destroy all monsters in
the previous room (they can't be
tamed) and also destroy the Gate
that summons them.

After defeating them, two slabs
will appear, one of them will
restore all of your HP and RP,
while the other one will do
nothing. The time will be
completely frozen, so this can
be a good place to train your
level and skills (plus you can
fight against all bosses again
after you do the second ending,
except Fiersome). Since the
first screen just shows your
currently room, there is no map
available for these rooms.

The final dungeon. To have
access to it you need first
collect all Tablet fragments
from all four seasons dungeons
(five Green Tablet fragments
from Trieste Forest, seven Blue
Tablet fragments from Blessia
Island, five Red Tablet
fragments from Messhina Valley
and five Ice Tablet fragments
from Padova Mountains), check
each dungeon section to know how
to obtain them. After that talk
to Barrett (he won't talk about
the tablets in all locations) to
learn about this place. Get the
Dragon Break magic book from
Alvarna Academy - Library at
upper left shelf. Finally, talk
to mayor Byron and ask to him to
improve one more floor on your
barn (it will have no costs to
you and the expansion will be
completed just after you talk to
him, but first you need to do
all barn's expansions). Enter in
the barn, walk to the elevator,
select "Go to a deeper floor"
until you see the option
"Basement Floor 28" and choose
it. You'll see a giant hole on
the floor, this is the entrance
to Palermo Shrine. Also note the
after you had entered at least
once this place, you can bring a
monster with you by taking it
out and moving to the barn's
door. Two options will appear
and you can go inside by
selecting "Go."

How to unlock all the rooms
(quickest way):

As you could see in the maps,
some rooms are blocked by
enormous doors. To get access to
all them and don't lose time, do
the following: First of all
bring your farming tools (axe,
hammer, hoe and waterpot) and
these seeds (one bag each):
Cabbage, Toyherb (Spring),
Cucumber, Eggplant (Summer),
Carrot, Yam (Fall), Turnip and
White Cabbage (Winter). You can
bring some Fur Sleeping Bags,
Formulas and Neutral Agents
(maybe you need this) if you
want.

From Palermo Shrine Entrance, go
to the north room (B1F Great
Hall) and try to run through the
north exit. Your character will
notice the two slabs (used to
unlock the door at B1F North
Room). After this go to the east
room (B1F East Room) and go down
one floor, move to north (B2F
Room 6) and active the switch.
Run one room to northwest (B2F
Room 4) and another to west (B2F
Room 5), kill everything and
activate the switch (the time
will freeze until you check the
statue, the same will happen in
others rooms with this trap).
Return to the last room (B2F
Room 4), go up one floor (B1F
Great Hall), move to west (B1F
West Room) and go down again
(B2F Room 1). Run to north (B2F
Room 2), activate the switch and
go to the southeast exit (B2F
Room 3). Go down (B3F Room 1),
run one room to east (B3F Room
2), one room to north (B3F Room
5) and one room to east (B3F
Room 7). Kill all monsters and
active the switch. Go back to
B3F Room 2, but now go one room
to east (B3F Room 3) and another
to north (B3F Room 4). Again,
kill everything and active
another switch. Now try to go to
B3F Room 2 (you need to kill all
monster in B3F Room 3 to keep
going), move two rooms to north
(B3F Room 8), kill everyone as
always and check the slab. Go
back to B1F Great Hall (use the
Escape magic book or just run to
there), move down one floor by
B1F East Room, run two maps to
north (B2F Room 8) and go down
(Mini Garden). Now you need to
pass through eight rooms (in
each room you need to destroy
all the things to keep going),
so it's a good idea to save if
you're not strong enough. Now
proceed until the last room and
active the slab. Go to B1F Great
Hall (use the Escape magic book
or just run to there), move to
north (B1F North Room) and go
down one floor (4 Seasons
Hallway). In this floor there
are four rooms in each extremity
(north way is blocked), so go to
all them, kill all the enemies
in the map, check the statue and
plant the crops that it says.
After all crops are fully grown,
check the statues and get the
Seasonal Orbs, opening the last
door.

11. Advancing to the Second
    Generation [Second]
################################

This section will cover the
basics about what you should do
to proceed to the second
generation of the game and tell
briefly what changes and what
does not. Notice the times I say
will be fastest ones to start
the new events (have a baby,
build the school, etc.), but it
doesn't mean you need to do this
exactly in this day. Actually
you can activate these events
anytime from the day I say, so,
if you're not in a hurry or want
to delay the events a little
longer, there's absolutely no
problem about it.


********************************
11.1. How to Advance [Advance]
********************************

First of all, for the ones who
are not aware, the second
generation covers the story of
the main character's son or
daughter (your choice). So, if
you want to advance to this part
of the game, the first thing you
need to do is to court the girl
you like until her love level
reaches 10 and then marry her
(see the Bachelorettes section
to know about proposal).

After you marry the girl, wait 9
days (you don't need to give
gifts or talk to her if you
don't want...even though that
would make you a very bad
husband...) and then talk to
her. She'll then say she'll be
having a baby soon, and you'll
be asked to choose if you'd
prefer a boy, a girl or if
either is fine. Notice this
choice will determine the
character you'll be playing with
in the second generation, so
pick the choice you like the
most. I don't think there's any
difference if you are a boy or a
girl, except that you'll be able
to have girlfriends or
boyfriends, respectively.

Wait more 6 days after choosing
the gender of the baby and then
go out of your house. When you
enter the house again you'll see
your wife will be holding the
newly born baby. In this same
day, you can already talk to
Byron when he's in his house to
discuss the building of a school
in the village and, if you have
100000G and 1000 pieces of wood,
you can talk to him again to ask
him to build the school.

The school will be built in the
Cherry Blossom Square and it'll
take 10 days to be ready. When
you go near the school after
it's finished you'll
automatically start some
conversations that will end up
starting the second generation
so, if you still don't want to
go to the second generation
after starting building the
school, be sure to don't go near
the door of the school in Cherry
Blossom Square after the 10 days
period. Because if you don't
actually pass in front of the
door the events won't start and
you'll be able to keep playing
in the first generation. The
same way, don't forget to go to
the school in Cherry Blossom
Square if you do want to proceed
to the second generation.

One thing you should pay
attention before starting the
events that will take you to the
second generation is the amount
of feed you have left in the
barn for your monsters. If you
don't want to lose friendship
points because of lack of feed,
you must be sure you have left
at least 33 feed FOR EACH
monster you have in the barn,
that is, if your barn is full
(you have 16 monsters), before
advancing to the next generation
you need to stock 33 * 16 = 528
feed in the barn in order to
guarantee that all of them will
have enough feed to eat during
the transition.

Just after you start the second
generation, a hurricane will hit
your farm, killing some of your
crops, just as an ordinary
hurricane would do. Actually,
there's a way to avoid the
disaster and save your crops. To
do so, just activate the events
to the second generation (go
near the school) after AM 12:00.
This way, after starting the
second generation, even though
you'll see the house shaking, if
you look at the weather icon,
you'll see it's not a storm, so
it won't affect your crops. Not
only that, notice as well that,
instead of starting playing in
the third day, you'll start the
game in the second day, meaning
you'll have one extra day. Well,
all of this seems very nice and
all and it really works MOST OF
THE TIME. Yes, I can't say why,
as I still don't understand it
myself, but sometimes, even if
you do activate the events after
AM 12:00 as I said, even though
you'll gain an extra day and
you'll see the weather icon
shows it not a storm, if you
actually go to a dungeon you
have planted anything in and see
your crops, sometimes they'll be
devastated the same way as if
they were hit by a hurricane.

In short, if you want to try to
save your crops from the
hurricane in the beginning of
the second generation, do the
following:
- Save your game before activati
- Activate the event (go near th
- Check your crops in the dungeo
 fine, otherwise reload your sav
 another time/day and see if you


********************************
11.2. What Changes (And What
      Doesn't) [Changes]
********************************

Starting a new life means you'll
have a lot of different things
to do, but not necessarily
you'll have lost all of your
efforts of the first generation.

First of all, I'll tell then
what you keep from the first
generation. Even though it may
not seem natural, all of the
physical status of the main
character will be kept, that is,
his level, status, skills and
alike. Also, you'll have all the
money and items he collected
(that is natural), plus your
father Kyle will give you a plot
item called Ancient Script. The
tamed monsters will like you the
same way (the Friendship level
won't drop).

Note about the tools: As I said,
you keep the items from the
first generation, including what
you gathered, the tools,
weapons...well, everything. But
when you start the second
generation, you won't have the
tools in your backpack from the
beginning, but don't worry. To
find them, check the chest in
your house (in the first floor,
the one that was never used for
anything) and you'll find the
tools. The problem is that a lot
of years without use caused them
to rust and they are not so good
anymore, that is, you can't
charge them anymore (if you
don't know what is charge, see
the Farming Tools section). If
you want to recover the tools to
their old selves or make them
even better than before, you
need to expand the school in the
second generation, building the
Workshop, that'll allow you to
start forging and upgrading the
tools and weapons (see the
Crafting section for details).

Finally, I'll tell about some
things that will change when you
start playing in the second
generation. The two main
differences I think you'll
notice are: the dungeons, that
are wider now, meaning some of
the fences won't block the way
anymore, because of your little
size, that allows you to pass
through holes adults can't, and
the monsters that are a lot
harder to deal with. And the
second difference is about the
villagers friendship towards
you, that will all be at level 0
(I can understand why everybody
doesn't like you yet, but how
come your own mother doesn't
like you as well??).

Well, one more interesting
difference I can point is the
new opening, starring the new
generation characters. I think
it's very nice, specially if
you're a bit tired of hearing
the same music and watching the
same movie over and over
(well...you'll eventually get
tired of watching this as well,
but at least it will pleasure
you a bit longer).

There are some other changes,
but I won't discuss about them.
Just to mention, I can say
you'll find new girls and boys
in the village to have as
girlfriends or boyfriends
(depending on what character you
chose), new abilities are
available, as you can cook,
forge, create accessories on
your own and I think you're life
will be slightly affected by the
school schedule.

Here you'll find some general
info that I think does not fit
very well in the sections shown
before.


********************************
12.1. The Bottles [Bottles]
********************************

During the game, you'll receive
some empty bottles as rewards
from villagers after you have
completed some specific quests
from them.

These bottles allow you to fill
them with potions and alike that
can be later consumed to restore
HP, for example. If you still
cannot create your own pharmacy,
you can fill your bottles by
asking Natalie to make you some
potion. You just need to ask her
to create one and give her 3
Medicinal Herbs and 300G.

Below are the bottles available
and how you can get them:

Bottle 1: Reward from Natalie
after finishing the quest "I
Lost My
    Stethoscope"
Bottle 2: Reward from Byron
after finishing the quest
"Please Find Someone" Bottle 3:
Reward from Douglas after
finishing the quest "Let's Talk
about This
    Like Men"


********************************
12.2. Earthquakes [Earthquakes]
********************************

During the first generation of
the game, sometimes you'll just
wake up and feel an earthquake.
They are pre-programmed events
and occur once a season on a
specific date. See below when
it'll happen:

- Spring 18
- Summer 11
- Fall 4
- Winter 23

Notice you won't lose the day,
even though the game plays the
sleep song after the earthquake,
you'll still wake up on the same
day, so there's nothing to worry
about.


********************************
12.3. Sale Off Coupons [Coupons]
********************************

Once a season you'll receive in
your mailbox a letter telling
the shops are offering a
discount in their items in that
day. The amount off varies in
each season and are only
available on that specific day,
so you should plan ahead to take
full advantage of it (doesn't
apply to all items). See below
the days you'll receive the
letter and how much you'll be
able to save:

- Spring 15 (10% off)
- Summer 16 (30% off)
- Fall 14 (20% off)
- Winter 15 (40% off)


********************************
12.4. Full Set of Tools [Full
      Set]
********************************

It's one of the utensils you can
buy from Yue on Wednesdays to be
placed in the Workshop. It's a
very well known utensil among
the ones who are familiar with
harvest moon games as it
contains the "Makers" tools,
that are: the Mayonnaise Maker,
Cheese Maker, Yogurt Maker, Seed
Maker and Thread Maker. All of
them allow you to create more
useful / expensive items by
throwing specific raw materials
in it. Below I'll give a brief
explain about each of them:

- Mayonnaise Maker: Produces may
- Cheese Maker: Produces cheese 
- Yogurt Maker: Produces yogurt 
- Seed maker: Produces seed by t
 this one if you have an active 
- Thread Maker: Produces thread 


********************************
12.5. Endings                   
********************************

This game have one great change
in the story and two endings.
You need to meet some
requirements to achieve them and
it is possible to do all of them
in just one save file. These are
the requirements for each of
them:

- Advance to the second generati
- First Ending: Defeat Fiersome 
open the Palermo Shrine by
getting all Stone Tablets
fragments, Dragon Break magic
book and all Seasonal Orbs to
open the last door (check
Palermo Shrine section).
- Second Ending: Defeat all secr
dungeon, collecting all the
Ancient Tablets and then talk to
Barrett. He'll learn about the
Omni-Gate spell and hide it. Go
to the Alvarna Academy - Library
and get it.

13. QuickLists [Quick]
################################

This sections contains some
lists that allows you to find
something quickly. Each
subsection covers something I
think it would be useful to read
occasionally while you play the
game, so these tables omit the
details and go directly to the
point. If you want more
information about anything you
should try to take a look at one
of the previous sections, in
which I tried to cover
everything in details.

The tables are always sorted by
the first column topic
(alphabetically), except for the
quests, that are sorted by
villager name and by order of
request.

13.1. Quest List - First
      Generation [List-Quest1]
********************************

This list shows the main topics
about the quests. In this table
you'll see who requests each
quest, a brief description about
what to do to finish it and what
you'll obtain by completing it.
The quests are ordered by
requester name and the
chronological order they request
each quest. If you want more
details about a quest, refer to
the corresponding section far
above (especially recommended if
you want a more interesting
description and to know more
about the answers you can choose
on the dialogues).

13.2. Quest List - Second
      Generation [List-Quest2]
********************************

It's the same as the quest list
for the first generation above.
But I'll assume you're already
more familiar with the game and
sometimes I'll not add so much
details as I did in the previous
list. If there's anything you
don't understand very well, if
you don't know where to find a
specific item or just want to
know more details about the
quest, please refer to the
Quests - Second Generation
section in this guide.

Again, this list shows the main
topics about the quests. In this
table you'll see who requests
each quest, a brief description
about what to do to finish it
and what you'll obtain by
completing it. The quests are
ordered by requester name and
the chronological order they
request each quest.

13.3. Monsters List [List-
      Monsters]
********************************

This list shows some information
about the monsters in the game.
In this table you'll find where
they live, what they can drop
when defeated, what the monster
can do to help in your farm
(either by working on it on
producing something), what's its
elemental attribute and its HP
at level 0.

The HP of the monsters increase
when you advance to the second
generation, the values presented
in this table show the amount of
HP they have when you face them
in the second generation, as
it's longest part of the game
and where you'll expend most of
your playing time (I think). So,
if you want to know how much HP
the monsters have in the first
generation part of the game,
take a look at the Monsters
section in this guide.

If you want to find an item by
drop name, I'd recommend taking
a look at the Alphabetical Item
List table.

(D) = Appears during day (N) =
Appears at night (A) = Appears
anytime (either day or night)

13.6. Alphabetical Item List
      [List-Alphabetical]
********************************

This table contains most of the
items you'll see in the game (at
least the ones I've seen so far)
and it tells you where you can
get this item.

I won't list quest items that
you just need to get it and
bring to the requester once,
since they can be found on the
Quest List in this same section
and I think it would just cause
this list to be harder to read
and they aren't that useful for
quick consultation.

Appears at night (A) = Appears
