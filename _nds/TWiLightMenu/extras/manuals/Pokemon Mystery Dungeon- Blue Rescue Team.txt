================
2a. Introduction
================

This is a guide written by
myself for the latest pokemon
game. I
 found this game enjoyable
 enough to spend quite alot of
 time on it as I'm sure many
 other people have as well. This
 will be my first guide on
 Gamefaqs and will most likely
 not be my last (depending on
 how this one turns out). I like
 to think of guides as a useful
 tool, and that is why you will
 not see a tiny little scrollbar
 to the right due to having the
 entire detailed Pokedex or
 every Wonder Mail code I can
 find listed at the end. I'm
 sure other people will do very
 well and detailed guides on
 both of those, and that's
 another reason why I am not
 writing a guide for them. A
 guide is about what is
 contained inside and I hope you
 find the information I write
 useful as the tool it was meant
 to be.

This guide was originally made
to be hosted on Gamefaqs, so if
any other
 sites (that I allow) host it,
 just remember it was originally
 made for a site that only
 allows pure text and small
 margins so that everyone
 everywhere can access the
 guide.


==========================
3a. The Basics of the Game
==========================

To start off, this game is not
like any of the previous Pokemon
 titles. Instead it has a turn-
 based strategy element to it.
 If you are familiar with titles
 such as Final Fantasy Tactis,
 than you will catch on to this
 quickly. What it means is that
 each Floor of a Dungeon has an
 invisible grid to it (which you
 can make visible by the push of
 a button). This grid is divided
 up by squares. Your pokemon
 will fit inside one of these
 squares and can move from
 square to square. Other pokemon
 on this grid can move around as
 well. Think of it as a
 chessboard and pokemon are your
 pieces.

Rescue teams are made up of 2-3
pokemon and only a maximum body
size of
 6. What is body size you may
    ask? The larger the pokemon
    is, the more
 body size it takes up, such as
 the legendary birds, dragonite,
 onyx, etc. are of a body size
 4. While your starter/partner
 should always stay at a body
 size of 1. When you are out
 rescuing you may only recruit
 pokemon who fit into your
 party( (a maximum of 4 pokemon
 or body size of 6). If you are
 trying to recruit a body size 4
 pokemon with 3 body size 1
 pokemon already with you..it
 will be impossible.

In this game there are a few
things you need to keep in mind
about your
 pokemon. First, your pokemon
 have PP in their movesets, just
 like in previous pokemon games.
 PP can be replenished with
 items such as Max Elixirs
 (replenishes PP of all moves).
 Also, a new feature, you need
 to keep track of your pokemon's
 Belly in this game. When you
 bring up the Menu you can keep
 track of your pokemon's Belly
 at the bottom Belly's can be
 refilled with types of food,
 such as Apples, Gummies, Berrys
 (minimal increase) so try to
 always keep some with you. The
 Belly will decrease as you
 maneuver your way through
 dungeons, the decrease in belly
 may accelerate if you are
 moving across odd terrain or
 hold down the B+A buttons (or
 if that pokemon is holding an
 item like the Heal Ribbon that
 will increase how fast the
 Belly depletes). The 2 items
 that help prevent Belly
 decrease are the Stamina Belt
 (which when held slows belly
 decrease) and the Tight Belt
 (which when held your pokemon's
 belly will never decrease. The
 Tight Belt is a very rare item
 though which can only be found
 after the credits have passed.

This game does not have trainers
like in previous games, instead
it has
 missions submitted by other
 Pokemon for your Rescue Team to
 embark upon. Missions can be
 found in your mailbox outside
 your base, on the Bulletin
 Board outside of the Pelipper
 Post Office, or by entering a
 Wonder Mail Code at the title
 screen. When your pokemon
 accept a mission from one of
 these locations it will then
 appear in their Job list. The
 Rescue Team may not embark on
 these missions until you bring
 up your Job List menu and
 choose to "Accept" missions.
 Multipe missions can be
 accomplished all at once, under
 the circumstances that they
 take place in the same dungeon
 and all of the Clients are on
 different floors. Example: You
 cannot rescue a Charmander and
 Squirtle if they both need to
 be rescued from the 2nd floor,
 but you can if one is on the
 2nd floor and the other is on
 the 3rd floor.

Once you unlock the ability to
do side missions, you can
complete them
 at anytime, and in fact they
 are a great way to level your
 pokemon, pickup some useful
 items and get some Rescue
 points for your rank. The main
 Storyline mission will be
 marked with "Go" when you walk
 downward from your Rescue Base,
 the storyline will wait for you
 as long as you want, so do not
 feel obligated to continue
 moving on.

To recruit a pokemon you need to
take a few things into account.
First is
 their Friend Area, if you do
 not have that your chance of
 recruiting a pokemon is already
 0% (unless its a pokemon like
 Kyogre who gives you his Friend
 Area upon recruiting him). Then
 you need to lookup their base
 recruiting % before any
 modifiers, I will personallly
 recommend this FAQ for more
 detailed information. http://db
 .gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvanc
 e/file/pokemon_fnd_red_pokedex.
 txt

 The above FAQ is written by
 TFergusson, nicely done.

 Once you know their base %
 there are 3 things that can
 modify this. Your current
 Rescue Team Leader's level,
 whether or not he has the
 Friend Bow equipped, and what
 your Rescue Team's Rank is. If
 your pokemon is lvl 90+ with
 the Friend Bow and Lukario
 Rank, then your chance to catch
 a pokemon is increased by 34%
 from the base %.

Rescue Team Ranks are determined
by how many Rescue Points you
have
 accumulated by completing
 Rescue Jobs. The following is a
 list of all the possible Rescue
 Ranks and the points required.

Normal Rank - 0 Rescue Points
Bronze Rank - 50 Rescue Points
Silver Rank - 500 Rescue Points
Gold Rank - 1,500 Rescue Points
Platinum Rank - 3,000 Rescue
Points Diamond Rank - 7,500
Rescue Points Lukario Rank -
15,000 Rescue Points

There are only 2 things I still
need to cover, IQ and Linking
Moves which
 I will do now.

IQ is a term that defines
intelligence, and that is a good
way to describe
 it for this game. During your
 adventure you are bound to come
 across some Gummies which you
 can feed to your pokemon.

Note: If you wait till after the
main storyline and "Give Gummi"
to a friend
 in it's Friend Area, they will
 also get a stat increase along
 with IQ boost.

When you feed a Pokemon a Gummi
it's IQ will increase, this will
depend
 on what kind of Gummi you feed
 it. If you feed a Pikachu a
 Yellow Gummi he will gain the
 most IQ from it over feeding
 him a Green Gummi. What's so
 important about IQ you might
 ask? Well IQ can allow certain
 pokemon to learn abilities
 later on, but what's really
 neat about it is it can improve
 the AI of both the pokemon you
 are controlling and your
 teammates. After so much IQ
 increase pokemon will learn IQ
 moves which can be set in the
 Menu -> Team
 -> Check IQ tab. Your pokemon
  will learn new IQ skills such
  as PP checker
 which keeps them from trying to
 use a move that currently has 0
 PP left. As the pokemon's IQ
 increases so do the skills it
 learns. Eventually your pokemon
 can learn more advanced moves
 such as Quick Dodger (more
 likely to dodge enemy attacks),
 All-Terrain Hiker (ability to
 walk on Water, Lava and
 Clouds), Trap Avoider (will
 avoid stepping on visible
 traps), and many more. There
 are plenty of reasons to raise
 your pokemon's IQ, my personal
 favorite is having my leader
 with Trap Seer (If the pokemon
 steps on an invisible trap it
 will not activate it, just make
 it visible) and giving my
 teammates Trap Avoider, almost
 making traps null and void for
 my team. There are tons of
 different IQ skill combos so
 make sure to experiment with
 them!

Finally, Linking Moves a
question on alot of minds. To
link moves you can
 either goto Gulpin's shop and
 pay him a small sum or use a
 Link Box, a fairly common item.
 Either way linked moves are
 moves that you set to go off
 together when one is used. If
 you link Scratch and Growl,
 then when you use Scratch, both
 Scratch and Growl will be used
 in a single turn (using 1 PP
 from each). If the PP of one of
 the linked moves hits 0, then
 the link is broken. What is the
 use for something? Well it's
 especially useful on bosses
 while going through the main
 storyline. Let's say you
 started with a Machop and
 linked the moves Low Kick and
 Focus Energy. This means each
 turn your Machop will use Low
 Kick, then increase his attack.
 This combo is very devastating
 when used against a boss. You
 can link all 4 of your moves
 together into one but it would
 be unwise as conserving your PP
 is one of the fun things about
 this game. Also Gulpin can
 remember any old move your
 pokemon used to know completely
 free of charge, so if you are
 unsure how a move will perform
 in a dungeon, just re-learn it,
 go try it out, if you don't
 like it, go back to Gulpin and
 swap it for another move. Make
 sure to experiment alot as
 linking moves and choosing your
 movesets are a lot of fun!





============
3b. Controls
============

These controls will only be for
Pokemon Blue for the DS as that
is what
 this walkthrough is written
 for. If you are playing Red,
 the buttons may be different
 for you.

Directional Pad - Move your
Pokemon around

A button - Confirm, basic attack

B button - Holding will cause
your Pokemon to run, can also
bring up
 the menu when standing still

X button - Brings up the menu

Y button - Holding this will
bring up the grid, and allow you
to turn
 around within your current
 square (very useful)

R button - Holding this will
only allow you to walk diagnolly
(helpful
 to conserve your belly and
 footsteps)

L button - Used in conjunction
with A

L + A buttons - Holding L and
pressing A will use the Special
Move you
 "Set" in the "Moves" option
 under the menu

B + A buttons - Will speed up
the passage of time allowing
your pokemon
 to regenerate life quickly, at
 the cost of belly loss.


================================
4a. Choosing your
Starter/Partner
================================

When you begin the game for the
first time you will be asked
some
 Personality questions. These
 questions, no matter how
 awkward they may be, are in for
 a purpose. In this game you are
 a pokemon, and these questions
 are to judge your personality
 and pick the pokemon closest to
 your personality.

After you finish answering the
questions you will be assigned a
pokemon.
 This will be your main
 character throughout the main
 storyline, so make sure you are
 happy with your choice. After
 the main storyline is finished
 you can swap your leader at
 anytime, and are able to catch
 all of the other starters who
 you did not choose. If you want
 to choose a specific pokemon
 then you will have to shoot for
 a specific personality,
 reference below.

# ### Pokemon: Male Personality:
Female Personality:

# 001 Bulbasaur Docile Calm #
004 Charmander Hardy Brave # 007
Squirtle Jolly Relaxed # 025
Pikachu Impish Hardy # 052
Meowth Quirky **** # 054 Psyduck
Relaxed Lonely # 066 Machop
Brave **** # 104 Cubone Lonely
Impish
# 133 Eevee              ****   
# 152 Chikorita **** Docile #
155 Cyndaquil Timid **** # 158
Totodile Naive Jolly # 252
Treecko Sassy Quirky # 255
Torchic Hasty Sassy # 258 Mudkip
Calm Timid # 300 Skitty ****
Hasty

**** = That pokemon is
     unavailable to that gender,
     as the final
 question you answer asks what
 your gender is.

Note: If you are a male and
really like Espeon and want
Eevee as your
 starter (just an example), from
 what I have noticed throughout
 playing through the game, there
 has not been any gender-
 defining moments. So it's ok to
 aim for the pokemon you really
 want without worrying about
 your gender.

Note: If you are having trouble
getting the pokemon you want for
a
 starter, I would recommend
 referring to this guide, it is
 very in-depth and very useful
 for how to answer the questions
 you are given.

http://db.gamefaqs.com/portable/
gbadvance/file/pokemon_fnd_red_p
ersonality.txt


After taking the personality
test I came up as a Mudkip, but
as my
 favorite pokemon of all-time
 was a Charizard, I redid the
 test until I got Charmander as
 my starter.


After you have your starter
chosen, you are then asked to
choose a
 partner pokemon. This pokemon
 is just as important as your
 starter as he will tag along
 with you on every mission until
 you finish with the main
 storyline. You will want to
 choose a partner who
 complements your starter well.

Possible Partners: Bulbasaur,
Charmander, Squirtle, Pikachu,
Chikorita,
 Cyndaquil, Totodile, Treecko,
 Torchic, Mudkip

Note: You cannot choose a
partner of the same element as
your starter.
 Example: Charmander starter
 cannot choose Charmander,
 Cyndaquil or Torchic
  as a partner.
 Example 2: Psyduck starter
 cannot choose Squirtle,
 Totodile or Mudkip
  as a partner.

Recommendations for Partners:

# ### Starter: Recommended
partners:

# 001 Bulbasaur Water-Type # 004
Charmander Grass-Type or Pikachu
# 007 Squirtle Fire-Type # 025
Pikachu Any # 052 Meowth Any #
054 Psyduck Fire-Type # 066
Machop Any # 104 Cubone Any #
133 Eevee Any (Can depend on
what you plan to evolve it into)
# 152 Chikorita Water-Type or
Pikachu # 158 Totodile Fire-Type
# 252 Treecko Water-Type # 255
Torchic Grass-Type or Pikachu #
258 Mudkip Fire-Type # 300
Skitty Any

I will try to be a little more
specific once I experiment more
with the
 possible combinations, for now
 those are mostly just elemental
 combos that complement one-
 another fairly well (Fire's
 weakness is Water so I
 reccomended a grass or
 electric-type to counter).

Personally I chose Pikachu to
partner up with my Charmander,
it turned
 out to be a fairly good team.
 Charizard has heat wave, great
 room-wide move and Pikachu had
 Quick Attack (allowing him to
 attack from behind) and
 Thunderbolt (AE 1 square
 attack).

Honestly any combination will
work, these are just to try and
give you
 the easiest time through the
 main storyline. If your
 favorite pokemon are Chikorita
 and Torchic, don't let what I
 said stop you.

Also this is one of the few
games where you are forced to
choose a name for
 your pokemon (like how you
 named you had to name your
 trainer in the other games). To
 start off you will name your
 partner. If you are really
 retentive about names, then
 decide now if you will ever
 evolve your partner (evolution
 is optional) and after you
 decide, give it the name of
 that pokemon u plan to evolve
 it into.

Once you have your starter and
partner chosen, it's time to
being the
 game.


===============
5a. Walkthrough
===============

To start off the game you will
see your chosen partner wake you
up. You
 will awaken as a *gasp* Pokemon
 (the one your personality
 matched). Then your partner
 will ask you who you are, and
 you will respond with a human.
 Your partner won't believe it
 since your outer appearance is
 now that of a pokemon. While
 your mind boggles at the
 infinite questions of the
 Metamorphosis (waking up as
 another creature) your partner
 will ask you for your name.

Note: Your main and starter are
the only 2 pokemon in the game
you are
 forced to nickname, so do not
 pull out a book of baby names
 just yet.

No matter what name you pick,
your partner will laugh at it
and get a good
 chuckle at your expense. But it
 wouldn't be much of a game
 without trouble and plenty of
 that there is as you hear a
 voice shouting for help. Enter
 Butterfree, your first
 "Client". His baby Butterfree
 fell into a cavern thanks to a
 fissure opening into the
 ground. The pokemon inside the
 fissure were violent to this
 peace-loving Butterfree so he
 came looking for help and
 stumbled upon your triumphant
 peace-loving duo. Your partner
 will be quite suprised that
 Butterfree was attacked by
 fellow pokemon and while the
 Butterfree frets, your partner
 will suggest you 2 go help the
 poor Caterpie out. As the
 standup team you are, you
 depart on your first rescue.


==============
5b. Tiny Woods
==============

Your first dungeon, and a great
place to get your feet wet. The
game should
 be providing you with tips as
 you progress. The first thin I
 would recommend doing is
 opening your menu with B,
 choosing Moves with A, choosing
 a good attack move (Tackle,
 Water Gun, Ember, Low Kick,
 whatever) and hitting A on
 that, and choosing the Set
 option. This sets that move to
 be used whenever you hold L and
 press A in conjunction with one
 another.

Just continue on down the 3
levels, picking up whatever
items you see and
 using your moves on pokemon. It
 is likely you will gain a level
 in here and get some much
 needed stat boost. Use this
 dungeon to help yourself get
 used to the controls, maneuvers
 and attacks. This dungeon is
 only 4 levels inhabited by
 Pidgeys, Sunkerns, Wurmples,
 and Exeggcutes. When you are
 finished with a floor, just
 head to the stairs and descend
 downward.

Once you reach the 4th and final
floor, you will enter a large
circular
 room where a crying and scared
 Caterpie awaits.

After Caterpie is rescued and
stares at your hero adoringly,
Butterfree
 thanks your daring team with a
 reward of an Oran Berry, Pecha
 Berry and Rawst Berry

Note: Even if you return to Tiny
Woods after unlocking Friend
Areas,
 you can not ever recruit
 pokemon here.

Once that is all said and done
your partner will offer you to
come with
 him since you have no place to
 go, and you graciously accept
 his offer. Your hero will be
 very happy with his new place
 to live (and base of operations
 as it's your Rescue Team's
 base). Your partner will
 explain about your mailbox and
 some natural disasters, then
 ask you about forming a rescue
 team with him. The obvious
 choice to move on is "Form a
 rescue team", if you "Refuse"
 your partner will just flip out
 saying what a smashing job you
 did and continue offering until
 you accept anyway.

You will get to now name your
Rescue Team, I won't give any
pointers, but
 try to be creative. After which
 you and your partner will get
 some good nights rest.

Your starter will wakeup still
sleepy, so just navigate him
back into the
 bed and save your game if you
 want. When you awaken you will
 meet your partner outside and
 take your "Rescue Team Starter
 Set" out of the mailbox. Which
 will contain the basics, your
 Rescue Team badge for rescuing,
 your toolbox for holding items
 and some Pokemon News. Pelipper
 will arrive soon after with
 some mail (he will deliver mail
 daily as long as your mailbox
 is not currently full, 4 is the
 maximum). Navigate to the front
 of the mailbox and open it up
 for your first official rescue
 job. Accept it and off you go
 to Thunderwave Cave.


====================
5c. Thunderwave Cave
====================

When you arrive you will meet
your clients, some Magnemites,
outside the
 cave and they will tell you
 their friends are on the B6F or
 Basement 6th floor. Just like
 Tiny woods the 6th floor will
 contain just the objective so
 you need to make it through 5
 floors of wild rampaging
 pokemon to complete this
 rescue.

Like Tiny Woods, this dungeon is
still what I would consider,
part of the
 tutorial. So make sure to take
 your time, explore around and
 test out moves and how enemies
 react to your movement. If you
 find yourself very injured, you
 can always hold A+B for quick
 life regen, but remember it
 will eat away at your belly.

After 5 floors of fighting it
out, you will come to the
Magnemite who
 have accidentaly been stuck
 together, after rescuing them
 you will be back outside the
 cavern watching the 4 Magnemite
 rejoicing. In their happiness
 they will hand you 500 poke, a
 Reviver Seed and a Rawst Berry
 for a reward.

Back at your base you will drift
off into dreamland, pay
attention to your
 dreams as he will have quite a
 few of them throughout the
 adventure.

At this point you will awaken,
go outside and your teammate
will drag
 you through town giving you a
 tour of everything there is to
 see and do. If you are still
 confused about any of the
 shops, you can refer above to
 the Game Basics section.

After your tour of town, you
will want to do an optional
mission, so pick
 one up at the bulletin board,
 head south from your Rescue
 Base, and get to rescuing those
 pokemon.

Note: Your toolbox is probably
packed at this point, so you can
head to
 Kangaskhan's bank and store
 some items to free up room for
 more.

Once you get some missions done,
you will find yourself dreaming
again,
 but an earthquake will
 interrupt you before you find
 anything out. When you awaken,
 Dugtrio will be waiting to ask
 for your help to retrieve his
 baby Diglett. To make matters
 worse Diglett was abducted by
 Skarmory and taken to the top
 of Mt. Steel, so off you go!

Note: Before you start heading
on new missions, you will want
to make
 sure your toolbox is stocked
 with items that may help you.
 Usually at this point I like to
 have an Oran Berry or 2, an
 Apple or 2, and a Reviver Seed
 (in case of accidents) with me.



=============
5d. Mt. Steel
=============

This is it, it is Mt. Steel and
Skarmory is waiting up top with
Diglett.
 This dungeon is 9 floors, if
 you did not do any side
 leveling you are going to have
 a very tough time here. I
 entered at lvl 8 and already
 was forced to use my Reviver
 Seed before even making it to
 the 2nd floor. You will
 probably want to be at least
 level 10 before giving this
 place a serious attempt and
 having some Oran Berrys and
 Reviver Seeds will help.

If you do manage to make it to
the top Skarmory is waiting with
Diglett.
 Try to use elements that
 counter Steel (Fire is great)
 or Flying (Electric). If you
 are having trouble with
 Skarmory have your leader
 backup and let your partner
 take the blunt of Skarmory's
 blows while you stand back
 throwing Gravelerocks. This
 strategy works fairly well for
 most of the main storyline.

Once Skarmory is defeated
Diglett is safe and you are free
to head back.
 After you are back in town,
 Friend Areas will be unlocked,
 after short talk with
 Magenemite/Wigglytuff. Now you
 can buy some Friend Areas and
 pickup some new recruits.

The storyline will continue in a
few days of doing optional
missions
 just like after Thunderwave
 Cave.


==================
5e. Sinister Woods
==================

After a few days have passed,
your friend Caterpie from the
start of the
 game will come to your base
 asking for help. Metapod is in
 trouble at the end of the
 Sinister Woods and needs your
 help. As he is telling you
 about this Gengar's Team
 Meanies steps in and decides
 they will do the job as well.
 The race is on! (It's not
 actually a race, no matter how
 long you take or how many days
 pass you will still make it in
 time).

Sinister Woods is 13 Floors and
packed with grass-types, if you
have a
 Fire-type starter or partner
 this dungeon should be fairly
 easy for you. Just make sure
 that your team is adequate
 leveled (low teens should be
 fairly safe). After making it
 through 12 Floors, Team Meanies
 will do battle with you on the
 13th. This is your first team
 battle so hope you picked up a
 good teammate (you can do this
 with your 2 starters, but I
 found a 3rd helps alot,
 Sudowoodo was a personal
 favorite at this point).

The 3v3 battle will commence,
none of the opponents have alot
of life,
 your team should be able to 2-3
 shot em (1 turn if the enemy is
 in range of multiple
 teammates). The biggest threat
 is Gengar, but even so I saved
 him for last as his 2 partners
 seem to have less life and are
 more easily killed (easier to
 predict one enemies dmg output
 than 3). If you are having
 trouble with this battle you
 may need to do a little
 leveling or bring more items
 (starting the fight off with a
 Gravelerock is a great way to
 do damage before the enemies
 are in range).

After you rescue Metapod, a
grateful Caterpie thanks you
outside your base
 and you get a feeling of
 accomplishment beating Team
 Meanies into the ground of
 course. When you awaken from
 your slumber, head to the Town
 Square to watch a scene of
 Jumpluff begging Shiftry for
 help. When Shiftry is pressured
 into leaving you have a few
 days to pass, so do some
 optional missions and level up
 a little until Jumpluff comes
 to visit asking for your help
 since Shiftry never came back.


================
5f. Silent Chasm
================

Theres a Jumpluff stuck in
there, and its your job to get
him out! As long
 as you have been keeping up on
 your leveling this dungeon
 should be alot easier than
 Sinister Woods was, due to the
 fact that its only 10 Floors (9
 packed with enemies) and there
 is a nice suprise awaiting you
 on the 10th Floor.

The enemies shouldn't be too
hard, there won't be anything
life or death
 coming up so you can take your
 time, pickup a new teammate or
 2 and loot the items up. When
 you reach the 10th Floor, bum
 bum buuuuuum, enter Zapdos who
 has taken Shiftry. You may have
 rescued Jumpluff but Zapdos
 flies off to Mt. Thunder with
 Shiftry in his claws and of
 course it will be your job to
 go after him and save him. Head
 back to Town Square to watch
 everyone worry about Shiftry,
 and your team and Team Alakazam
 will decide to go try and help
 Shiftry. When you are ready
 (check toolbox, do any optional
 missions, etc.) then head down
 from your base and off to Mt.
 Thunder.


===============
5g. Mt. Thunder
===============

When you arrive at Mt. Thunder
your partner will be wondering
where
 Alakazam's team went, then
 speak of how tough fighting
 Zapdos sounds. No matter how
 scared he is he'll get over it
 and the two of you will be
 ready for quite a battle.

10 Floors later (the 11th Floor)
is where a Save Point is, if you
manage
 to reach this point your PP and
 Belly are both completely
 refilled and you can save your
 game. After the Save Point
 there are only 3 levels to go
 with Zapdos awaiting you on the
 3rd.

When you reach the summit, your
partner will challenge Zapdos to
come
 out and fight. He will stand up
 for the captive Shiftry, Zapdos
 will answer your challenge and
 soon the battle for Shiftry
 will commence.

Note: You cannot catch Zapdos
until after the main storyline
is complete
 so don't waste hours trying to
 catch him!

-Submitted by Gentlecat482

On the way up to Zapdos I
recruited a level 14 Electrike
and when I finally
 reached Zapdos he made this
 fight all too easy. Electrike
 just absorbed all the Electric-
 type attacks, while me and my
 partner beat him easily.

After you defeat Zapdos he will
submit and you are allowed to
rescue the
 captive Shiftry. Alakazam's
 team will showup and cover for
 you, then Alakazam will reveal
 that he knows your hero is a
 human in pokemon form and tell
 you to meet Xatu at the top of
 the Great Canyon. So you decide
 to sleep on it and will head
 out in the morning.

For Recruiting purposes: Zapdos
is lvl 45 when recruited.


================
5h. Great Canyon
================

When you awaken it's time to
head to the Hill of the Ancients
in the
 Great Canyon. You and your
 partner will have a little
 heart to heart outside your
 base before deciding to depart
 and find out what happened to
 you.

Note: If you have done no side
missions to level up yet, now is
a great
 time to do so, once you
 complete Great Canyon you won't
 be able to do missions or
 access the town for awhile. If
 you want to be fairly
 comfortable try to lvl up
 somewhere around 15-20.

This dungeon is a fairly
straight forward 12 floor
dungeon with Xatu
 waiting on the 13th Floor for
 you to arrive. You will not
 have to fight him, when you
 arrive it will trigger more
 storyline. A comical scene
 where you and your partner try
 to get Xatu's attention will
 ensue. Once you do have his
 attention he will tell you that
 you are a human (which should
 be obvious by now). Then he
 will tell you that you becoming
 a pokemon is related to the
 disasters. This just deepens
 the mystery of you becoming a
 pokemon, but then Xatu tells
 you he feels the world's
 destruction coming closer
 everyday. Once you see Gengar
 dropping in you will be asked
 to save and then a long journey
 will begin once you head to the
 Town Square.

 If you get lost here, just goto
 Town Square to hear some
 storyline, they
  will direct you up to Whiscash
  to hear the Ninetales Legend.
  After just head back to your
  base where you will talk with
  your partner then goto sleep
  and meet Gardevoir in your
  dreams. After you awaken just
  head to the Town Square for
  the story to continue on. Let
  the running of the pokemon
  begin! (you will understand
  once you reach this point)


==============
5i. Lapis Cave
==============

You are now a fugitive and your
pokemon are running for their
lives.
 Luckily as they are catching up
 to you, you find a dungeon out
 of the way and decide to enter
 it.

Note: While you are away from
town, the save stones allow you
to access
 your bank and save your game.

This dungeon is only 14 floors
with no boss awaiting you at the
end and
 shouldn't be too much trouble
 for your team, especially if
 you did some leveling before
 Great Canyon like I suggested.
 Once you emerge from the
 dungeon your partner will be
 tired, and notice a "Mountain
 of Fire" which is even more
 disheartening, but the pokemon
 hounding you are catching up so
 its away you go!


=============
5j. Mt. Blaze
=============

Before entering Mt. Blaze there
is a save point that allows you
to also
 access your storage. When you
 walk up to the cavern you are
 given the choice of Mt. Blaze
 or Rocky Path. Rocky Path is a
 4 level dungeon implemented for
 those who did not level up
 before now. If you are too low
 level for Mt. Blaze you can run
 Rocky Path a few times to level
 up and gather a few items
 before entering Mt. Blaze. When
 you feel you are fully
 prepared, choose Mt. Blaze.

Mt. Blaze is a total of 15
Floors, once you pass the 12th
Floor there is
 a save point waiting you before
 the final 3 Floors. Make sure
 to save as the boss, Moltres,
 is no cakewalk. This dungeon is
 packed with Fire-type pokemon
 along with lava spots (Fire-
 type like Charmander can walk
 on those). If you do manage to
 get all the way to the top,
 Moltres will be waiting for you
 on the 3rd Floor after the save
 point.

When you reach the peak your
partner will notice the lava
level has risen
 most likely due to the recent
 natural disasters. Your partner
 will want to get out of here
 very quickly, but Moltres has
 other plans since the Mountain
 is shrieking in agony to him
 and he believes you are the
 cause.

To defeat Moltres you will most
likely want to use a strategy
close to
 the one you used to defeat
 Zapdos. Stepping back and
 throwing items while your
 partner takes a beating works,
 either that or infect Moltres
 with a status effect through
 Sleep Seed, Thunder Wave,
 Disable, or something along
 those lines. If you can keep
 him under a status effect for
 most of the battle you should
 win fairly easy.

After you defeat Moltres he
doesn't want to giveup but your
partner will
 try to explain what's going on
 in the world, and why you ended
 up here in the first place.
 Moltres will believe you and
 allow you passage as long as
 you promise him that you will
 find the reason behind the
 disasters and stop them from
 happening.

For Recruiting purposes: Moltres
is lvl 52 when recruited.

When you pass Mt. Blaze your
partner will be panting for
breath once again
 and talk about how far you
 managed to come, but you still
 have a long way to go because
 Alakazam's team can catch you.
 So, it's off on your adventure
 again.

After trekking it out through
the frozen snows of the north,
you will
 come across an Absol in the
 middle of nowhere. The Absol
 will prance away and you will
 come across a save point as the
 2 of you continue on.


=================
5k. Frosty Forest
=================

After you finish with your
storage/save point then you can
head north and
 have the choice of either
 Frosty Forest or Snow Path.
 Snow Path is another 4 Floor
 dungeon that is just a side
 path to level up and gather
 some items if you did none of
 this before your quick
 departure from town. If you
 need to do any level'ing run
 Snow Path a few times, but when
 you are ready for Frosty Forest
 continue reading.

Frosty Forest is the ice
equivalent of Mt. Thunder and
Mt. Blaze, which
 can only mean one
 thing...Articuno lies in wait
 at the end. You can expect
 almost the same setup as the
 previous dungeons, 9 levels of
 Ice-type (and a few assorted,
 like Rock/Steel/etc.) enemies
 then a save point where the
 10th Floor would be. Unlike
 before there will be 5 levels
 after the save point with
 Articuno awaiting you on the
 5th.

After 5 levels you will see some
talking, don't let the voice
scare you
 just continue on determined! If
 you manage to make it to
 Articuno use the same strategy
 you did on the previous birds
 (Status effects, or ranged
 attacks with your teammate
 taking the blunt of the blows).

When you finally manage to force
Articuno to submit, your partner
will
 beg him to let you pass.
 Articuno will describe the
 recent problems that the
 forest's ice has been having
 lately and will not allow you
 to pass. Articuno will continue
 getting worked up until Absol
 inteferes and explains to
 Articuno what is truly
 happening. Articuno will then
 let you pass as long as you try
 to prevent the calamities from
 continuing. After discussing
 with you about the calamities
 Absol will decide to join you
 in your quest.

For Recruiting purposes:
Articuno is lvl 53 when
recruited.

As the three of you walk along a
frozen path discussing things,
Gardevoir
 will appear and tell you to
 continue on to meet Ninetales
 at Mt. Freeze peak. So, off you
 go!


==============
5l. Mt. Freeze
==============

When you arrive there will be
yet another save point here
waiting for you
 so prepare your gear (you won't
 be fighting a boss so you won't
 need items like Sleep Seeds
 here). Once you are fully
 prepared and ready to move on
 head north into the cavern
 where you will be given a
 choices between Mt. Freeze and
 Snow Path. Snow Path, is the
 same 4 level dungeon covered in
 the Frosty Forest section
 above. When you are prepared to
 move on choose Mt. Freeze.

Mt. Freeze is a total of 20
Floors, after 15 Floors of
Normal, Dragon and
 Water-Type monsters you will
 find a save point. The Final 4
 Floors are inhabited purely by
 Glalie (Ice-Type) so if you
 have a Fire-Type with you this
 should be fairly easy. With
 Absol now on your team this
 dungeon shouldnt cause you any
 more trouble than usual, just
 remember that floors in this
 dungeon tend to be fairly large
 so it may take awhile to reach
 the save point (you may want to
 bring 2 Apples or so).

The Ninetales you have been
searching for will be waiting
for you on the
 5th floor after the save point.
 Before you find him Alakazam's
 team manages to catch up to you
 and your 2 teams will faceoff
 (you will not control this
 fight). While your 2 teams
 crash Ninetales will appear and
 explain that your pokemon is
 not the human from the legend.
 You will learn more about the
 curse and the Gardevoir that
 appears to you here before
 finding out the earthquakes
 will awaken Groudon. Alakazam's
 team will leave to quell
 Groudon since your team would
 be no match for him.

After Mt. Freeze it will flash
back to town, where Gengar is
still trying
 to keep the town riled up
 against you. Then Pelipper will
 deliver a note from Alakazam
 proving your innocence and all
 shall be well.

Now its back to completing
optional missions! If you barely
managed to
 make it through Mt. Freeze
 alive, you will want to do
 quite a bit of leveling. Mid
 20-s (25 or so) should be
 fairly safe before moving on.
 Just continue completing
 missions until you have a dream
 about Gardevoir again. The next
 morning a Wynaut should appear
 outside your base and ask you
 to look at his notice on the
 Bulletin Board. The mission
 should be called "Punish Bad
 Mankey!" accept this mission to
 continue on with the storyline.


=================
5m. Uproar Forest
=================

Once you accept Wynaut's mission
you will now have Uproar Forest
unlocked
 and ready to adventure to. If
 you around lvl 25, this dungeon
 should be very easy for you.
 Just make sure to bring
 standard items, and an apple or
 2. This dungeon is a total of
 10 Floors.

Note: This is the best dungeon
in the game to gather Gummies
(Green and
 Grass). So if you are in need
 of stat increase (after
 storyline) or want some easy IQ
 for your party, then come here
 with X-Ray Specs
  on and gather up the items.

This dungeon will be mostly
filled with Grass-Type pokemon
and should prove
 no real challenge for your team
 (especially if you have a Fire-
 Type with you). After 9 Floors
 of clearing, the 10th Floor is
 where the Mankeys are awaiting
 you.

Note: If you found any Chestnuts
on the 9th Floor, make sure to
make room
 in your toolbox for them. You
 will find out why they are
 useful soon enough.

On the 10th Floor you have to
fight a team of 3 Mankeys
(remember your battle
 with Gengar's team). This fight
 should prove no real difficulty
 and after you force the Mankeys
 to submit you will head back to
 your base to talk to the
 waiting Wynaut. After some
 dialogue the Mankey gang you
 beat up will arrive on the
 scene and see the chestnut the
 Wynaut gave you. You will peel
 the chestnut, and give to the
 Mankey gang who will then begin
 work on your Rescue Base. After
 a short period they tire and
 require more chestnuts (2 in
 total). The only place to get
 chestnuts is on the 9th Floor
 of Uproar Forest so it's back
 there you go.

Once you gather the 2 chestnuts
the Mankey gangs job will be
finished, but
 they won't like that, so they
 will try to destroy your base
 so they can rebuild it for you.
 After this scene is finished,
 it's time to go back to
 completing optional missions.


================
5n. Magma Cavern
================

-This part of the guide was
 actually submitted by
 iluv2draw123 and edited by
 myself, thank you for taking
 the time.

It's been many days after
Alakazam's team went down to
duke it out with
 Groudon, and the people of
 Pokemon Square start to worry,
 so a town meeting is called.
 Blastoise, Octillery, and Golem
 agree to go down and save
 Alakazam's team. Here you might
 want to do optonal missions in
 places where high level Pokemon
 are because you're about to go
 down there as well. Level up to
 about Lv. 27 because this is
 going to be a rough brawl.
 Anyway, after a day or two, the
 rescue party comes back wiped
 out. After an inspiring speech
 your partner gives, rescue
 teams of all sorts gather their
 pride and march down into Magma
 Cavern.

This dungeon is the largest
dungeon yet. after 23 levels of
pure terror,
 a save statue awaits you,
 followed by another 2 levels
 until you finally come upon
 Tyrannitar and Charizard who
 say Alakazam is still duking it
 out with Groudon. You go up to
 Alakazam and with a flash of
 light he is gone but out comes
 Groudon, the continent Pokemon.
 Now comes a tough fight just
 use the previous boss
 strategies and you should be
 able to pull out a win.

-This strategy for Groudon
 submitted by arcticb0i

Items Required: Gravelerock x 40
(Minimum)
   Reviver Seed x 5 (Minimum)
    Oran Berry x 2 (Minimum, one
    held by partner, one held by
		Absol.

Party Members: Charmander Lvl 26
(Me)
    Pikachu Lvl 26 (Partner)
   Absol Lvl 26

Align your party in such a way
that Absol is the ONLY ONE
taking damage from
 Groudon. This means that the
 formation should be in the
 shape of an "L", where the
 straight line consists of (in
 order) Groudon, Absol and
 Charmander while Pikachu is
 standing right of Charmander.
 Set Gravelerocks as a shortcut
 item and just keep spamming
 them in the direction of
 Groudon. If Absol dies/is hurt,
 chances are it'll heal itself
 or get healed by Pikachu.
 Otherwise, a Reviver Seed will
 automatically come into effect
 and revives Absol. At this
 rate, Groudon will be gone
 faster than you can say "Jack
 Robinson"!


Once the battle is finished,
Groudon disappears and Alakazam
appears on the
 floor. Tyranitar and Charizard
 come up to you and you five
 leave the dungeon together.

For Recruiting purposes: Groudon
is lvl 37 when recruited.

Everyone greets you when you
return. Suddenly, Xatu (who you
met on Hill of
 the Ancients) uses telekinesis
 to tell everyone a meteor is
 heading straight towards the
 planet! I will tell you about
 that in the next section.


=============
5o. Sky Tower
=============

-This part of the guide was
 actually submitted by
 Legends334 and edited by
 myself, thank you for taking
 the time.

This is the final chapter in
your epic storyline, and what a
challenge it
 is. 25 large floors of monsters
 (some ghosts so watch the
 walls), then a save point and
 then nine more floors of horror
 with Rayquaza awaiting your
 arrival on the ninth.

To get here you will need the
'Teleport Gem' from Xatu. To get
it, go to the
 dungeons list, click Sky Tower,
 and you'll meet Xatu at the
 peak of Great Canyon again.
 You'll use the Gem and be
 teleported to Sky Tower's 1st
 Floor. (Why can't they just
 teleport to the top?) You'll
 want to be levels 30 - 35 or
 else... TRAIN!! Anything lower
 may be doable, but you will be
 relying alot on pure luck then.
 If you're a Water-type, great!
 (I was a Mudkip) You can also
 have a Water-type partner. Try
 to get a TM for Ice Beam (from
 Mt. Freeze or Frosty Forest. I
 found mine in Sky Tower) try
 for 2 of them if you can. For
 the last nine floors, you will
 be facing a barrage of
 Salamence, Metagross, Flygon,
 Tropius, and incredibly
 annoying Aerodactyl.

Make sure to bring out all the
stops for this dungeon as it is
very difficult
 on your first run through.
 Reviver Seeds, Oran Berrys, Max
 Elixirs, Status- inducing
 Seeds, quite a few Apples, etc.

Best way to beat Raquaza...
Mudkip (me)
Cyndaquil (partner)
Absol (partner 2)

Items Reviver Seed x5 (minimum)
Silver Spike/Gravelrock x25 each
(minimum) Oran Berry x7
(minimum) Link box x2(minimum)
Max elixer x3 (minimum) Sleep
Seed x4 (minimum)


My Strategy using the above
setup:

Keep throwing Silver Spikes, and
Gravelrocks (Use Ice Beam if you
have it,
 it's super effective). When he
 gets 3 grids away start to link
 all your and your partner's
 moves together. Then resume
 throwing your silver spikes.
 When he's right in front of
 you, use those linked moves!
 Make sure you're holding an
 oran berry just in case he uses
 Dragon Claw for massive damage.
 If you're partner is running
 low on hp throw an oran berry
 at him and he/she'll use it
 automatically (if they were
 holding one they'll use that
 automatically also). Make an
 'L' shape again so that Absol
 is the only one taking damage.
 Try to position yourself behind
 Absol. If Rayquaza starts doing
 heavy damage, throw a Sleep
 Seed at him to induce Sleep.
 When he wakes up throw another
 one and he'll be dead before
 you can say "I like
 Applesauce!" (Literally)

Once the mighty Rayquaza
submits, be prepared for one
fantastic ending (but
 don't be sad, the game will
 continue on).

For Recruiting purposes:
Rayquaza is lvl 45 when
recruited.


-Following strategy submitted by
 .:starfox:. .

I had a Charmander, a Mudkip, an
Absol and a Shuppet (note that I
recruited
 the shuppet in the dungeon) and
 I had 6 reviver seeds, 10 max
 elixirs and the rest was pretty
 standard setup.

I used the TM Secret Power on my
Charmander and Ice Beam on
Mudkip.
 That made this way too easy!!!
 Secret Power paralyzed Rayquaza
 and Ice Beam made his HP drop
 like a rock! (Ice Beam is super
 effective)

Note: If you want to come here
after the main storyline you
will need the HM
 Fly from Wyvern Hill.




=======================
6a. After the Storyline
=======================

Now that you have beat the main
storyline of the game, and are
probably
 basking in its infinte glory,
 there is still much for your
 rescue team to accomplish.
 Plenty of new dungeons to
 unlock, tons of pokemon to
 catch and other suprises await
 you as the game now opens up
 for exploration.


================================
6b. Dungeons automatically
unlocked
================================

When you finish with the main
storyline and are ready to enter
a dungeon,
 you may notice you have quite a
 few more options. Just by
 completing the storyline these
 new dungeons are now available
 to you.


================================
6b1. Luminous Cave (How to
Evolve)
================================

A part of the shattered meteor
has unlocked this cave north of
the Town
 Square in Wishcash Pond. The
 only way to enter this cavern
 is by having a single pokemon
 in your party (the pokemon you
 want to evolve) then by
 entering the cavern. You will
 notice that there is a giant
 glowing crystal which will ask
 you if you want to evolve your
 pokemon. As long as you meet
 the pre-requisites of that
 evolution you may evolve your
 pokemon at anytime here. If you
 are unsure if your pokemon is
 ready to evolve or even can
 evolve open the Menu, choose
 Team, choose the Pokemon you
 want, choose Summary and tap
 over to the final menu screen,
 at the bottom it will say
 Evolution: and either Not now,
 No more or Possible.

Note: If your partner is still
following you around, go
complete a mission
 or a dungeon, the problem
 should fix itself afterwards.


===============
6b2. Solar Cave
===============

If you don't have Solar Cave
unlocked, goto the Town Square
and talk to
 the following people in this
 order. First Medicham, then
 Lombre, then finally Whishcash
 who should give you HM Dive.

HM Heaven, this cave contains
HMs located on Floors 10, 15 and
20, but
 they are guarded by locked
 doors or surrounded by water,
 so you will need to find keys
 and have a water pokemon to
 snag them all. Keys are also
 found in this dungeon.

HM Dive is located on floor 10,
a Link Cable will be here if you
already
 have it, you need a key to
 reach it.

HM Waterfall is located on floor
15, a Link Cable will be here if
you
 already have it, you need a key
 to reach it.

HM Surf is located on floor 20,
a Link Cable will be here if you
already
 have one, you need the ability
 to cross water to reach it.


===================
6b3. Waterfall Pond
===================

This dungeon is home to alot of
significant water pokemon,
including 3
 starters. Mudkip on Floors 1-3,
 Totodile on Floors 6-10 and
 Squirtle on Floors 8-12. The
 dungeon is a total of 19 Floors
 and also contains one version-
 specific pokemon to each
 version. Magikarp exclusive to
 Blue on Floors 7-11 and Feebas
 exclusive to Red on Floors
 16-19. If you want more details
 on catching both in your
 version head down to the
 "Catching them all" section.

Note: To enter you will need the
HM Waterfall, which is found in
Solar Cave, more details right
above.


================================
6c. Dungeons unlocked through
Friend Areas
================================

Some dungeons are unlocked
purely through purchasing or
earning Friend
 Areas. This section is
 dedicated to those dungeons.


================
6c1. Wyvern Hill
================

This dungeon is unlocked once
you complete an optional mission
with the
 Friend Area Dragon Cave as the
 reward. This dungeon is 30
 levels with the infamous HM Fly
 located on the 30th floor
 behind a locked door, make sure
 to bring a key. A great place
 to catch dragon pokemon like
 Bagon and Dratini.


====================
6c2. Darknight Relic
====================

Were you looking for a good
Ghost pokemon to add to your
team? Well look
 no further, Darknight Relic is
 15 floors of pure Ghost-type
 pokemon (I hate fighting them
 so much). Make sure you don't
 let them trap you in hallways
 while they attack from the
 walls. To unlock this dungeon
 you need to purchase the Friend
 Area Conceal Forest from
 Wigglytuff.

Something that can help you
counter the Ghost-types is
wearing a Pierce Band
 and then you can successfully
 throw items at them.


==================
6c3. Desert Region
==================

This dungeon is unlocked by
purchasing the Friend Area
Sizzling Desert
 from Wigglytuff. It is a
 standard 20 Floor dungeon
 filled with mostly Ground-type
 Pokemon. Some examples of
 pokemon you will encounter here
 are Sandshrew, Trapinch,
 Nosepass, Baltoy, Gligar and
 more.


====================
6c4. Southern Cavern
====================

Southern Cavern is available
after completing an optional
mission with
 the reward being the Rock Cave
 Friend Area. This dungeon is 50
 levels of mostly Rock/Ground
 pokemon. If you were looking to
 recruit all the starters Cubone
 can only be found here from
 Floors 5-10. Also this dungeon
 is home to the very rare Metal
 Coat, located on floors 49 and
 50. Some pokemon you will
     expect to see here are
     Geodude, Diglett,
 Vibrava, Larvitar, Rhyhorn, and
 a few others along with their
 evolved forms. This is also the
 only place to catch Larvitar if
 you wanted a Tyranitar for
 yourself and Pupitars, when
 recruited here, join you as a
 lvl 35 (Larvitar is only lvl
 28).


==============
6c5. Grand Sea
==============

This dungeon is unlocked by
purchasing the Quiet Sea Friend
Area from
 Wigglytuff. To enter it will
 require you to have the HM Dive
 or a water pokemon who knows
 Dive with you. This dungeon is
 filled with water-type pokemon
 along with the occasional
 Dragonite. The rare Mantine can
 be found on the 30th Floor
 only, but it can only be found
 in the Red version to start. If
 you own the blue version you
 need to enter a Wonder Mail
 code and complete the mission
 before Mantines will start to
 appear for you. More detail on
 the version-specific pokemon in
 the "Catch em All" section.


================
6c6. Unown Relic
================

This dungeon is unlocked by
purchasing both Ancient Chamber
AN and Ancient
 Chamber O? from Wigglytuff. As
 the title suggests, this entire
 dungeon is filled with Unowns,
 all 11 Floors of it. There
 isn't really anything special
 here other than alot of Unowns
 for you to recruit and add to
 your collection of party
 members.


================
6c7. Far-Off Sea
================

This dungeon is unlocked by
purchasing the Quiet Sea Friend
Area from
 Wigglytuff. To enter you will
 need both the HM Dive and a
 water pokemon with you. Also as
 a sidenote, you cannot switch
 your party leader in this
 dungeon. It is a total of 75
 Floors filled with mostly
 Water-Type pokemon. This
 dungeon has a few pokemon that
 can only be recruited here such
 as Lapras. Also the Tight Belt
 can be found in this dungeon.


===============================
6d. New dungeons you can unlock
===============================

There are plenty of dungeons
that are possible to be unlocked
after you
 finish the storyline, this
 section will try to cover them
 all for you.


===================
6d1. Howling Forest
===================

This dungeon can actually be
completed before the credits,
but as it's
 optional and unlikely you will
 without a Wonder Mail Code it
 will be covered here.

This dungeon is unlocked by
completing a Wonder Mail mission
that has
 the reward of the friend Area
 "Sky Blue Plains" soon after
 there should be a rescue
 missions up on the Bulletin
 Board by Smeargle to rescue him
 from Howling Forest. Once you
 accept this mission this
 dungeon becomes available to
 you. Smeargle will
 automatically join you after
 completion.


===============
6d2. Stormy Sea
===============

This dungeon is fairly easy to
unlock, all you need to do is
first talk
 to Medicham and Lombre in the
 Town Square, then after go up
 to Whiscash Pond and talk to
 Wishcash himself, he should
 award you with the HM Dive
 which unlocks this dungeon.

40 Floors of water pokemon and
you must have the HM dive in
your toolbox
 or have a water pokemon who you
 taught dive to with you to
 enter. Your reward for braving
 this 40 level dungeon is a
 battle with Kyogre at the
 bottom, he has approximately a
 50% chance to join your team
 and will come with his own
 friend area, so your hard work
 is well worth it.

For Recruiting purposes: Kyogre
is lvl 25 when recruited.


================
6d3. Fiery Field
================

Once you obtain HM Surf from the
20th floor of Solar Cave, the
next day
 a Spinda should appear in
 Pokemon Square who will talk
 about meeting the mirage
 pokemon. After a lengthy
 discussion he will hand you the
 Clear Feather which you must
 take to Xatu. Go back and scale
 the Great Canyon and after
 meeting with Xatu this dungeon
 is now open for exploration.

You will need Surf HM or a
pokemon who knows surf to enter
this dungeon,
 you are also forced to save
 your game before entering. This
 is a 30 floor dungeon with
 Entei located at the end (you
 cannot catch him on your first
 clear). Once you defeat him he
 will dye your feather a Red
 Color and you will now have
 access to Lightning Field.

For Recruiting purposes: Entei
is lvl 45 when recruited.


====================
6d4. Lightning Field
====================

After defeating Entei this
dungeon is now open for
exploration, but like
 Fiery Field you must have Surf
 in some way with you and are
 forced to save your game before
 entering.

This is another 30 floor dungeon
with Raikou waiting for you at
the end
 (he cannot be caught on your
 first clear), after you manage
 to defeat Raikou he will dye
 your feather a Yellow (now its
 Red and Yellow woot) and this
 will give you access to
 Northwind Field.

For Recruiting purposes: Raikou
is lvl 45 when recruited.


====================
6d5. Northwind Field
====================

Once 2 dogs have been downed by
your unstoppable team, you will
have this
 dungeon open to you, like the
 previous 2 Fields you need Surf
 and will be forced to save on
 entry.

Suprise, suprise, 30 levels with
the final dog Suicune awaiting
you at
 the bottom. If you manage to
 force Suicune to submit, he
 will grant your feather a 3rd
 color turning it into the
 "Sunset Feather" grating you
 access to the Mirage Pokemon at
 last.

For Recruiting purposes: Suicune
is lvl 45 when recruited.


================
6d6. Mt. Faraway
================

Now that you have defeated all 3
dogs, it is time to put your
skills to
 the test and to climb Mt.
 Faraway. This dungeon will also
 require Surf and a save before
 entering.

This dungeon, unlike the fields,
is 40 levels and a bit harder,
so be
 prepared for a bit of a trek
 upwards. If you bring a key
 with you from Solar Cave it is
 possible to nab yourself a rare
 Friend Bow inside a locked door
 on the 30th floor (you
 definitly want this Bow).
 Waiting for you on the 40th
 floor is Ho-oh the legendary
 bird. Ho-oh shouldn't be too
 difficult for you to defeat if
 you managed to brave all 39
 previous levels of Mt. Faraway.

Note: Ho-oh's recruit % is 99.9,
but you cannot recruit him the
first time
 you fight with him. So come
 back a 2nd time with body size
 of 2 or less and make sure your
 party leader gets the final
 blow (can make your partner
 "Get Away" under tactics for
 guaranteed final blow).

For Recruiting purposes: Ho-oh
is lvl 50 when recruited.


=================
6d7. Buried Relic
=================

After you have cleared the
Stormy Sea, you should receive a
mail in you
 mailbox about the Buried Relic.
 All you have to do after that
 is head to the Town Square and
 talk to Shiftry and Lombre to
 unlock this massive dungeon.

Note: Make sure you have an open
spot in your mailbox for the
mail you are
 to receive (maximum of 4
 letters can sit idle in your
 box at one time).

This dungeon will probably be
the first 99 level dungeon you
experience.
 You will also be forced to save
 before entry, so make sure to
 have an Escape Orb in case you
 run into trouble. Also you will
 want a way to defend against
 Monster Houses and Traps as
 this dungeon is packed with
 them.

What makes this dungeon really
special is being home to a few
HM's and
 multiple legendaries. On the
 15th Floor is Regirock who,
 when defeated, drops the Rock
 Parts for your toolbox. The
 25th Floor holds Regice who
 holds the Ice Parts and 35th
 Floor houses Registeel who
 holds the Steel Parts. If you
 gather all 3 of these parts in
 your inventory they will mesh
 together to create the Music
 Box. As long as you hold the
 Music Box in your toolbox (do
 not use it) Mew can appear
 anywhere between the levels of
 36-99. He may appear multiple
 times per dungeon clear and may
 transform into other pokemon,
 so keep an eye on your log at
 the bottom for "Mew has
 transformed". Be wary, he is
 fairly weak and 1-shottable so
 make sure to have him next to
 your party leader before
 attacking, also he is very very
 hard to catch and will drive
 some insane, so be prepared to
 spend quite awhile trying to
 catch this very cute and rare
 psychic pokemon.

Note: If you want to recruit
Mew, you need to purchase the
Final Island
 Friend Area from Wigglytuff
 first.

The Hm's located here are Rock
Smash, Strength, Flash and Cut.
Rock Smash
 is on the 45th Floor and
 requires a Key, Strength is on
 the 60th Floor and requires a
 pokemon that knows Rock Smash
 or the ability to pass through
 walls, Flash is on the 70th
 Floor and requires a key, and
 Cut is on the 80th Floor and
 requires a key, Rock Smash and
 the ability to cross water.

For Recruiting purposes:
Regirock is lvl 18 when
recruited. For Recruiting
purposes: Regice is lvl 23 when
recruited. For Recruiting
purposes: Registeel is lvl 25
when recruited. For Recruiting
purposes: Mew is lvl 40 when
recruited.


===================
6d8. Northern Range
===================

Northern Range will be available
once you have both the HM Surf
and have
 purchased the Friend Area
 Southern Island from
 Wigglytuff. This dungeon is
 down here as it ties in closely
 with Pitfall Valley and wanted
 the two of them to be right
 next to each other.

Once you have the above criteria
met, you should awaken at your
HQ the next
 day, and after walking outside
 to inspect what is going on a
 blur will zoom by stealing all
 of Kecleons supplies. As the
 hero of this Town you decide to
 depart to where it flew off
 to...Northern Range.

This is a 25 level dungeon, it
should not be too difficult at
this point,
 but still take normal
 precautions. After you reach
 the 25th floor you will meet
 with the thief, the legendary
 Latios. You must fight him in a
 battle and hopefully win. If
 you manage to down this bird he
 will tell you he only stole
 supplies to try to rescue his
 sister Latias from Pitfall
 Valley. As the upstanding
 citizens you are you decide to
 help out this poor bird.


===================
6d9. Pitfall Valley
===================

Another 25 level dungeon
unlocked after defeating Latios.
This dungeon is
 a step up in difficulty but
 nothing your team shouldn't be
 able to handle. All you need to
 do is descend the 25 floors,
 rescue Latias (no boss fight)
 and use the "Teleport Gem" to
 head back to town. Once Latias
 is reunited with her brother
 the 2 Lati@s will offer to join
 your Rescue Team which I hope
 you graciously accept.

For Recruiting purposes: Latias
is lvl 29 when recruited. For
Recruiting purposes: Latios is
lvl 30 when recruited.


==================
6d10. Western Cave
==================

Once you go back to Mt. Faraway
and recruit Ho-oh on your team
an event
 will be started once you arrive
 back at your Rescue Team base.
 This was my personal favorite
 event as it involves Mewtwo,
 and just how it was portrayed.
 After it's over head to the
 town square where the Charizard
 and Blastoise you saw will come
 up to you injured letting you
 know about Western Cave. This
 will unlock the cave for
 exploration, to head here all
 you need is the HM Surf or a
 water pokemon who knows it.

This cave is 99 Floors and the
first place where I really felt
handicapped
 Belly-wise. I should have put a
 Stamina Band on my leader (who
 knows Trap Seer or I'd wear No-
 Stick Cap). What I did to
 counter the hunger issues, was
 pickup every berry/seed I saw,
 and ate them (each gives 5
 Belly back), except for seeds
 that confuse you. Also I found
 a Kecleon shop 20-30 floors up,
 that had 4 Gummies all cheap
 which I could easily afford
 (Gummies give alot of belly and
 I was forced to eat a few of
 em). The Gummies along with the
 Berrys/Seeds and the 2 Huge
 Apples I brought managed to
 easily get me to Floor 98, in
 fact my Belly was full when I
 found Floor 99's stairs so I
 sat near the stairs utilizing
 A+B and let some Charizards and
 Blastoises come to me for some
 nice exp.

This dungeon is my favorite
place in the game to level, some
prefer the
 1-room monster houses in Silver
 Trench, but just one clear here
 I accumulated approximately 10
 levels (went from mid-60s to
 mid-70s). There is nowhere in
 the game that can match that
 experience as far as I know.

Mewtwo is waiting for you at the
end, but if your stats are
buffed and
 you managed to make it through
 all 98 previous floors of those
 difficult pokemon, he should be
 a pushover for you.

Note: Mewtwo's recruit % is
99.9, but you cannot recruit him
until the
 2nd time you encounter him.
 Also his body size is 1 which
 makes him that much easier to
 recruit since you can bring 3
 pokemon as long as their body
 sizes don't hit the maximum
 total of 6.

For Recruiting purposes: Mewtwo
is lvl 40 when recruited.


===================
6d11. Silver Trench
===================

Once you have cleared Stormy
Sea, recruited the Lati@s combo
and managed
 to befriend all 3 legendary
 birds, you may unlock this
 dungeon. The next morning when
 you awaken, head over to the
 Town Square and talk to
 Alakazam. He will mention a
 disturbance by where the
 legendary birds Friend Area is
 located. So what do you do? You
 head left of your base and
 visit one of the legendary
 birds. They will give you the
 Whirl Symbol allowing you
 access to the Silver Trench.
 Also to enter you will need the
 HM Dive and a water pokemon in
 your party.

Silver Trench is 99 Floors
packed with mostly Water-type
pokemon and the
 legendary bird Lugia waiting at
 the end. Lugia (unlike most
 legendaries) can be recruited
 on your first clear and has a
 99.9% base chance of
 recruitment.

There is one thing that everyone
will remember after clearing
this dungeon
 and that is the one-room
 floors. Just like when you use
 a One-Room Orb the entire floor
 is one giant box filled with
 monsters. If you have an
 ability that hits the entire
 room, like Heat Wave, these
 floors are a great way to get
 some experience. This dungeon
 isnt too difficult compared to
 some of the other 99 floors
 especially being forced to
 bring a water pokemon you can
 walk across the deep water if
 you see a shortcut to the
 stairs. Just bring the usual
 toolbox setup you usually bring
 for a 99 Floor with a few extra
 apples and you should have no
 problem clearing this dungeon.

For a 99 Floor I usually bring
an Escape Orb, No-Stick Cap (if
my leader
 does not have Trap Seer), 2x
 Huge Apples, Max Elixir and a
 Reviver Seed. This dungeon
 seemed to have a shortage of
 food when I went so I brought
 an extra Huge Apple (would
 recommend 4 total if you are
 unfamiliar with these 99 Floor
 dungeons). Maybe it was just
 bad luck for me but this
 dungeon does seriously lack
 food so make sure to bring
 enough to get you through.

For Recruiting purposes: Lugia
is lvl 30 when recruited.


=================
6d12. Meteor Cave
=================

After befriending Lugia, Meteor
Cave will be available to you.
This
 dungeon is unique in the fact
 that it contains only 1
 pokemon, the legendary Deoxys.
 The dungeon is filled with
 different Deoxys mirages of his
 4 types, Normal, Attack,
 Defense and Speed. Each floor
 you must defeat the Deoxys
 mirage before the stairs are
 unlocked, and you are allowed
 to progress to the next floor.
 The dungeon is a total of 20
 Floors with Deoxys awaiting you
 on the 20th.

Deoxys shouldn't be difficult
for you at this point, but he
does have a
 very low recruit %. His base
 recruit chance is -10%, thats a
 negative, so even with a lvl
 90+ leader, Friend Bow and
 Lucario Rank, you still only
 have a 24% chance to recruit
 him. You may be spending awhile
 here getting yourself a Deoxys.

For Recruiting purposes: Deoxys
is lvl 35 when recruited.


==================
6d13. Joyous Tower
==================

This dungeon is automatically
available from your dungeon list
after
 saving the Lati@s duo and
 obtaining the Sky Blue Plains
 Friend Area. This is a 99 Floor
 dungeon, with no reason to ever
 finish all 99 Floors. This is
 one of the "Level 1" dungeons
 in the game, where your
 pokemons level is temporarily
 set back to 1. The main reason
 you will find yourself inside
 of this dungeon is to recruit
 its list of pokemon that can
 only be found here. Also, if
 you want anything from the
 Kecleon shops here your money
 is reduced to 0 when you enter,
 so you will have to find money
 as you go. Final note, there is
 a required save before entry,
 so you will most likely want to
 bring an Escape Orb.

Note: Kecelon shops here have a
chance of having the Friend Bow
for sale.

Some examples are: Pichu,
Wurmple, Cyndaquil, Bulbasaur,
Treecko, Torchic,
 and many others. Other than the
 pokemon to recruit, there is
 not much reason to venture in
 here much.


===================
6d14. Purity Forest
===================

Like Joyous Tower, this dungeon
is unlocked after saving the
Lati@s duo
 and obtaining the Sky Blue
 Plains Friend Area. This is
 another 99 Floor dungeon where
 your level is temporarily set
 to 1 (you may level inside the
 dungeon). This dungeon also
 prohibits you bringing any
 companions, items, money and no
 pokemon inside can be
 befriended. This is probably
 one of the most frustrating
 dungeons you will find in this
 game, as your survival is based
 almost entirely on how lucky
 you are with item appearances.

If you do manage to make it
through all 98 Floors, then
Celebi will
 be waiting for you on the 99th
 Floor and will automatically be
 recruited into your party.
 Celebi is the only reason worth
 braving this dungeon and it
 will probably cause you hours
 and hours of frustration
 working on it.

For Recruiting purposes: Celebi
is lvl 45 when recruited.

Tips for Purity Forest Submitted
by TheDarkPaladin9

Tip 1- Try and find a Pass
Scarf. They really do
wonders(especially in
 Monster Houses)

Tip 2- Try and find a full
supply of Apples and Big
Apples(for the scarf)

Tip 3- Try and find four
Frustration TMs. They really
help through out the
 whole dingeon.

I have figured these out by
myself. I have also recruited
Celebi with these
 tips.


===============
6d15. Wish Cave
===============

Once you have the Lati@s duo and
Sky Blue Plains Friend Area, you
need to
 head to Whiscash's pond and
 look for Medicham and Ekans
 from Team Meanies. Talk to
 them, then complete optional
 missions, then go talk to them
 again. Complete more missions,
 then only Ekans will be left,
 head to the Pelipper Bulletin
 Board and look for a rescue
 request from Medicham to unlock
 this dungeon.

To enter you will need HM Surf,
money will be reduced to 0,
level will be
 temporarily reduced to 1 and
 you will be forced to save
 before entering.

This is another 99 Floor dungeon
where your level will be set
back to 1.
 Something to make the entire
 dungeon easier on you is giving
 your leader the Tight Belt and
 spending some time leveling up,
 especially on the Skarmory
 floors. If you are just here
 for Medicham, make sure to do
 some leveling on your way up so
 you can't get yourself into too
 much trouble. Some pokemon like
 Togepi can only be found here
 also, so you will need to
 probably come back to recruit
 some.

If you lose your Wish Stone, you
can find another on the 50th
Floor. If,
 when you reach the 99th Floor,
 you have the Wish Stone on you,
 Jirachi can grant you a wish.
 If you get him to grant you a
 wish, you can still come back
 to recruit him. When you are
 ready, defeat Jirachi and he
 will join you with his 99.9%
 recruit rate (make sure leader
 gets final blow, etc.). Some of
 you won't want to brave this
 dungeon more than once to get
 wishes, and can just recruit
 him on the first attempt and
 never have to worry about
 scaling all 99 Floors again.

For Recruiting purposes: Jirachi
is lvl 40 when recruited.


================
6d16. Murky Cave
================

If you have cleared Stormy Sea
and completed the mission to
rescue Medicham
 from Wish Cave, then the next
 morning Gengar will come see
 you. He will first ask to be
 taken to Mt. Freeze to see
 Ninetales.

Note: Ghost pokemon are
frustrating escorts!

When you arrive you will find
out Gengar was actually the
human from the
 legend who was transformed into
 a pokemon. After pleading with
 Ninetales he will tell Gengar
 to goto Murky Cave to find the
 answer if he can be transformed
 back into a human. So it's off
 to another escort mission.

Murky Cave is now unlocked for
you! It's a 20 floor dungeon (19
with
 enemies) and escorting Gengar
 may be a little frustrating
 since some of the opponents are
 ghosts and will attack him
 through walls. If you do manage
 to make it down to the 20th
 Floor, Gengar will be judged
 and after a long conversation
 Gardevoir will be released from
 the curse he took under the
 condition that he will not
 remember Gengar or anything
 that happened. The next morning
 if you head into the Town
 Square you can recruit
 Gardevoir to join your team (he
 will join as lvl 5).


=====================
6e. Catching them all
=====================

As in other pokemon games there
are ways to "Catch" or in this
case "Recruit"
 them all, this section is
 dedicated purely to the
 information of hard to find or
 acquire pokemon. So, for those
 of you who are just looking to
 have all 386 for that
 "completionist" feeling, then
 this section is for you.


=============================
6e1. Version-Specific Pokemon
=============================

There are quite a bit of
version-specific pokemon, but
there are ways
 to bridge that gap. Below are
 some Wonder Mail codes, along
 with the location they take
 place at (so you know if you
 can accomplish them), along
 with the rest of the
 information about them. Once
 you complete that Job, the
 pokemon that was unlocked will
 now appear in the wild in the
 same areas it has been in the
 opposing game.

=============================
6e2. Dungeon-Specific Pokemon
=============================

This section is all about where
pokemon can be found only in a
single
 dungeon, like how Bulbasaur
 (while a starter choice) can
 only be found in Joyous Tower.
 Also as a note, if you are out
 trying to recruit these
 pokemon, recruiting a Bulbasaur
 is going to be MUCH easier than
 trying to recruit an Ivysaur
 due to their base %'s. Just
 like how recruiting a Blastoise
 is .1% (if lvl 100, Friend Bow
 and Lucario) while recruiting a
 Squirtle is 45.7% under the
 same conditions. If a pokemon
 is missing from this list, than
 it can be found in multiple
 dungeons or it can only be
 found through evolution (check
 next section).

### - Pokemon - Dungeon, Floors
X-X

001 - Bulbasaur - Joyous Tower,
      Floors 1-5

If you want more detailed
information on locations,
recruit #'s, potential
 moves/HM's, and more about
 pokemon you can refer to a
 guide written by Terence
 Fergusson. He did a fantastic
 job documenting all this
 information and putting it into
 a well-written format.

 http://db.gamefaqs.com/portable
 /gbadvance/file/pokemon_fnd_red
 _pokedex.txt

 It's located there, just use
 Ctrl+F to find the pokemon you
 are interested in.


==================
6f. Reward Statues
==================

You may or may not know, but
there are 4 statues you can get
that sit
 outside of your Rescue Team
 base. They serve no special
 purpose other then the prestige
 they bring, but they are still
 something fun to try for. There
 are a total of 4 statues and
 here is how to get them.

Bonsly Figure - Complete the 17
"Type" mazes in the Makuhita
Dojo (The
    Team Mazes are not counted
    in this)

Lucario Figure - Get the Lucario
Rescue Rank

Mime Jr. Figure - Through a
Wonder Mail mission

Weavile Figure - Through a
Wonder Mail mission

I won't go into depth on any of
these, but a good Makuhita Dojo
FAQ is
 located here:
http://db.gamefaqs.com/portable/
ds/file/pokemon_md_makuhita.txt

Along with a good Wonder Mail
FAQ (should contain the
passwords needed)
 is located here:
http://db.gamefaqs.com/portable/
gbadvance/file/pokemon_md_wonder
_mail.txt

The first is done by Dalent67
and the second done by
ZombieInfection,
 nicely done guys.


========================
6g. Unknown Dungeon Mode
========================

-This section submitted by
 FlygonBreloom

When you are near someone that
has a DS that is set to Unknown
Dungeon
 Mode and you also have your DS
 set to Unknown Dungeon Mode,
 they will react to one another
 and both people of you receive
 free items. I haven't been able
 to test this with multiple or
 different people though or keep
 it in Mystery dungeon Mode with
 another person for very long
 but, basically it gives you
 free items if you acivate it
 with another person around
 (That also has Mystey Dungeon).

Also of note Unknown Dungeon can
be repeated an infinite number
of times.


=======
7a. FAQ
=======

Q: You FAQ is missing _______

A: You can send it to me using
the "Contact Me" information
below, just
   make sure that I can
   interpret what the email is
   about by the subject or it
   may be deleted right away as
   I get alot of spam and if
   your email is just "Hi" with
   an unknown address I may
   delete it thinking it's spam.
   I will appreciate any
   assistance though.


Q: How many pokemon are
recruitable in this game?

A: All 386 are implemented and
recruitable, along with hints to
other
   pokemon not included (such as
   Munchlax and Lucario).


Q: My pokemon is XX level why
can't I evolve yet?

A: You may evolve after the main
storyline is over inside of a
cave
   that opens in town. You may
   only bring 1 pokemon into the
   cave at a time. Do a ctrl+F
   "Luminous Cave" for more
   details.

   If I get anymore emails
   asking how to evolve I will
   not reply as it's clearly
   stated multiple times in this
   FAQ/Walkthrough how to, and
   it shows me you put no effort
   forward to look for the
   answer yourself before
   emailing me.


Q: How do I change my leader?

A: You must first goto the
Friend Area of the pokemon you
want to make
   leader, then choose Join
   Team, then Make Leader. This
   pokemon is now your leader
   and your previous leader is
   still in your party.


Q: Why won't XX event start for
me, even though according to
your guide it
   should have started.

A: Make sure you have completed
any previous events as you may
not be able
   to be working on multiple
   events at once (Example:
   Complete the feather to meet
   the mirage pokemon, and
   Unlocking Silver Trench).


Q: Where is a great place to get
Gummies?

A: Uproar forest if you aren't
looking for any in particular,
bring some
   X-Ray Specs so you can find
   them easier on each floor, it
   nets the most (Grass/Green
   Gummies).


Q: Why can't I catch XX pokemon?

A: First goto Wigglytuff and
make sure you have that
pokemon's Friend
   Area unlocked, once you have
   that you have to realize some
   pokemon have very very low
   chances, even in the
   negatives to be recruited. To
   counter this you will need a
   high leader level, high team
   rank, Friend Bow equipped and
   have your leader deliver the
   killing blow.


Q: Why is it when I go back to
capture a legendary bird,
Groudon or
   Rayquaza I cannot reach them?

A: You must not be attempting to
complete a mission or the
dungeon will
   end right at the "Save Point"
   area and you will not have
   access to that dungeons
   "Peak".


Q: Pokemon X has a 100% recruit
chance yet I can't recruit him,
why?

A: This means either your party
is too big (some legendaries are
4 body
   size so you can only bring up
   to 2 body size with you) or
   your team leader did not get
   the final blow on the
   pokemon. Also the pokemon you
   are trying to catch needs to
   be adjacent to you.


Q: I just evolved my pokemon and
he didn't have the option of
learning
   any moves his evolved form
   should have learned on this
   level or on previous levels,
   why?

A: Gulpin is the man, at the end
of my Game Basics, I tried to
give a
   quick overview of what
   Gulpin's shop can do for you,
   and my favorite option is the
   "Remember" option. Unlike
   linking Remember is
   completely free of charge,
   and allows you to re-learn
   any move that your pokmeon
   has already learned or should
   have already learned. Good
   example is evolving
   Charmander to Charizard,
   Charizard should have learned
   Heat Wave on lvl 1, but as
   you are most likely above lvl
   36 it's not really an option.
   But, what you can do, is goto
   Gulpin and choose to relearn
   Heat Wave for another ability
   (lets say Scratcth). Let's
   say you don't like Heat Wave
   and want Scratch back, you
   can just head right back to
   Gulpin's shop and Remember
   Scratch for free again, make
   sure to experiment with
   movesets as changing them
   around is completely free.

Q: Where do I get keys to get
the HMs?

A: Keys are located in Solar

Q: If I lost HM ___ from dying,
can I get a new one?

HM from the exact spot you found
the
   old one. The only exception
   to this is HM Dive, as the
   first one you get is from
   Whiscash, but subsequent
   Dives will be found on the
   10th Floor of Solar Cave.

both found in Solar Cave on
Floors 1,
    10, and 16 (for both stones)
   Water Stone on the 29th Floor

   Lightning Field Fire Stone on

   Ribbon is on the 20th Floor
   of Wyvern Hill Metal Coat is
   on the 49th and 50th Floors
   of Southern Cavern


Q: Where is the fastest place to
level up?

A: Fastest place to level up
that I have seen is either the
popular 1-room
   Monster Houses of Lugia's
   Silver Trench or spending
   some time on Floors 40-60 and
   89-98 in Western Cave where
   most enemies (Skarmory,
   Absol, Tyranitar, Alakazam,
   Charizard, Blastoise) all
   give over 1000 experience
   each when killed by a move,
   and if you manage to get a
   monster house of them you are
   looking at upwards of
   5000-6000 experience from
   just that room. If you manage
   to nab yourself a Tight Belt
   you can spend alot more time
   on these floors just farming
   the experience.

   Submitted by Sixftdwarf:

   Just wanted to let you know I
   found a neat little trick. If
   you use a One Room Orb on a
   floor with a monster house,
   the whole floor becomes a
   monster house. A useful trick
   if you're trying to level,
   but not as useful if you're
   barely surviving, like I was
   at the time I discovered
   this.


Q: Where do I get the Friend
Bow?

A: The easiest place to get it,
in my opinion, is bringing a key
to Mt.
   Faraway on the 30th Floor,
   you can also get them from
   Kecleon shops in Joyous
   Tower. The Friend Bow
   increases your chance to
   recruit a pokemon by 10% when
   equipped.


Q: Where do I get the Tight
Belt?

A: The Tight Belt is a very rare
item that can only be found in a
few
   specific spots. It can appear
   randomly on Floors 1-5 and
   51-54 of Far-off Sea, but the
   chances are low, Floors 1, 4,
   20, 21, 50 and 60 of Purity
   Forest and Floors 1-4 of
   Marvelous Sea. It can also be
   found in Purity Forest shops
   and as a Buried item in Far-
   Off Sea.


Q: What are Buried Items?

A: Buried items may only be
found by smashing walls with
Rock Smash or
   having a pokemon with the
   ability Pickup along, he will
   have a chance of picking up a
   Buried item every level. Also
   a Ghost pokemon while
   traveling through walls can
   pickup Buried items.
   Personally, I've had a very
   hard time getting Buried
   Items, hopefully you have
   better luck.

 --Submitted by OmegaDestroyer

 -I had a Swampert equipped with
  a Mobility/Mobile Scarf, and
  he walked
  over a part of a wall and
  found a (TM) Giga Drain hidden
  in the wall, so I was thinking
  Ghost-type pokemon as well as
  pokemon using the Mobile Scarf
  may be able to simply walk
  over a buried item in a wall
  to pick it up.

  I'd also note that
  Ghost/Mobile are a more
  efficient way of getting to
  the items that need Rock
  Smash, such as the HMs in
  Buried Relic.

 --Some more notes on Buried
   Items

  On average I would say there
  are 3-6 items per floor with
  4-5 being the norm, don't stop
  looking after only 3 items.

  The Pickup ability is not
  required as Linone does not
  seem to find any uniquely
  buried items upon entering a
  new floor, but from what I
  have heard he can.

  When breaking the walls, have
  both of your pokemon mobile,
  breaking them 2 at a time is
  much more efficient.

  An item will eventually appear
  and you can interact with the
  item as you see fit (picking
  it up, using it, throwing it,
  etc.)

  After knowing all of this,
  just systematically remove all
  the walls on every level (this
  will not work on boss levels
  such as the Regi's) and reap
  the rewards.


Q: Where is Mew?

A: Mew appears in Buried Relic
between 36th Floor and 99th
Floor as long
   as you carry the Music Box in
   your Toolbox (Do not Use it,
   just have it with you). He
   may appear more than once
   between those floors, but he
   can only appear when you
   reach the floor (he will be
   one of the original red dots
   and cannot come in if you
   wait). Sometimes he will use
   Transform and you will see
   "Mew used Transform" at the
   bottom which is an easy
   tipoff he is on this floor,
   but he will not always use it
   and his recruit chance is low
   so let the hunting begin!


Q: Where did Skarmory go? He
disappeared from Mt. Steel.

A: Skarmory can only be caught
in Wish Cave (Floor 35+) or
Western Cave,
   (Floor 40-49)so you probably
   will not have a Skarmory of
   your own for quite awhile.


Q: Why can't I catch the
legendary birds?

A: They can only be caught after
the main storyline is over, they
also
   have a body size of 4, so
   make sure not to bring more
   than 2 body size with you.
   Finally, they do not have
   100% recruit chance so be
   prepared to spend a little
   while trying to catch all 3.


Q: What happens when you spend a
very long time on a specific
floor?

A: There is actually a system
built in, that there is a
limited number
   of turns you can spend on a
   single dungeon floor. If you
   are approaching that number,
   you will see messages about a
   wind blowing or a mysterious
   pokemon. If you see those
   messages it's a hint to find
   the stairs asap, as if you
   stay on a floor for the
   maximum amount of turns you
   will be blown out of the
   dungeon (same circumstances
   as if you had died, losing
   items, etc.). This applies to
   every dungeon so don't loiter
   around too long.


Q: What is the best pokemon to
bring into a level 1 dungeon?

A: It all comes down to personal
preference, I would personally
recommend
   Charizard (it may not level
   super fast, but it doesn't
   level as slow as others like
   Blastoise). His 4 level 1
   abilities including Heat Wave
   are very useful and his stats
   are fantastic.

   If you have a personal
   preference you can e-mail me
   about it and I'll post your
   preference and why as long as
   it's valid reasoning.


Q: Why can't I catch a Kecleon?

A: First since his base recruit
chance is -33.9% you must be lvl
90+ with
   Friend Bow equipped to get
   the maximum 34% boost
   bringing your recruit chance
   up to 0.1% or 1 in 1000. The
   Kecleons are lvl 90 and can
   have any of their possible
   power-up moves. Another note
   is they move twice for every
   one of your turns, so if they
   can reach you in a single
   turn, they can also attack
   you.

   You will want to come very
   prepared for this, bringing
   at least 10 Reviver Seeds, an
   Escape Orb, Friend Bow, X-Ray
   Specs and maybe some Oran
   Berries. You will also want
   to come alone as your
   partners will just waste
   Reviver Seeds, and your
   leader needs to get the final
   blow to recruit one anyway.
   Silver Thorns are a great way
   to damage them if they are
   standing far away, so you can
   also bring some of those.

   To engage the Kecleons you
   must first steal from their
   shop. Before you attempt this
   make sure you know where the
   stairs are as you will want
   to make a break for them once
   you finally do catch a
   Kecleon (Escape Orbs are
   disabled on the floor you are
   fighting Kecleons). Once
   engaged, Kecleons will
   continue to spawn for
   eternity coming to fight.
   Since the recruit chance is 1
   in 1000 be prepared to spend
   awhile attempting this, use
   the X-Ray Specs to find their
   shops on each floor.

   Note: If the Kecleons turn
   you into a decoy (by using
   Substitute) you
  can still attack and recruit
  them, but they will completely
 ignore you until it wears off.


Q: How do I get the dungeons
Marvelous Sea, Oddity Cave,
Remains Island,
   and Fantasy Strait, also what
   is so special about them?

A: They are unlocked through
Wonder Mail Codes! The following
codes are
   straight from
   ZombieInfection's Walkthrough

The sad thing is, they aren't
really all that special, they
have no new
 pokemon, but they are fun to
 venture through. I've also
 noted that they seem to have
 high appearance rates for some
 of the rarer items in the game.
 That in itself is worth your
 time to explore them.

Note: These dungeons have
between 15-25 Floors each, so
they are not too
 extensive.
