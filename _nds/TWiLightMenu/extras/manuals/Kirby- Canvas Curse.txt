  + Introduction [KiIntr] +
  +-----------------------------

Hello, and welcome to the Kirby:
Canvas Curse Walkthrough written
by me, snkupo. This guide will
ultimately be your complete
guide, and will tell you how to
do, and where to find everything
that's in this game. This
document was started just after
I had finished my Metal Slug 3D
walkthrough, and I hope this one
will receive just as good
feedback as the Metal Slug one
did, and still does. It is the
European version of the game
that I am playing. The only real
difference between the US and
the EU versions, is that the EU
one is named Kirby: Power
Paintbrush. The Australian
version is also named Kirby:
Canvas Curse. Feel free to
contact me on mail if you would
like to comment my work. Both
positive and negative feedback
will be appreciated, as long as
you're constructive.

  +-----------------------------
  + About Kirby: Canvas Curse
    [KiAbou] +
  +-----------------------------

Canvas Curse is the first Kirby
game for the Nintendo DS, and
was developed by HAL, the
company behind the series as a
whole. When the game was
released, the Nintendo DS had
suffered from very few top
games, and in my eyes, this was
the start of a huge wave of
quality titles for Nintendo's
handheld. Now, we have titles
like Viewtiful Joe, Phoenix
Wright, Partners in Time,
Resident Evil and so on, but at
the time Kirby was released, we
didn't. Thanks HAL!

In Canvas Curse, a witch has
turned Dream Land into a
painting. She turns Kirby into a
ball when he gives chase.
However, Kirby meets the Power
Paintbrush, and together, the
two of them sets out on
adventure!

This game is a singleplayer only
game. You will be using the
stylus that came with your
Nintendo DS all the time - you
wont even have to think about
the buttons on your system. Your
adventure will be a
sidescrolling one, where you use
the stylus to command Kirby
around, and make paths for him
by stopping enemies, creating
Rainbow Lines in the air and so
on. There are quite a few
collectibles, but the funniest
thing might be the different
abilities that Kirby can steal
from his enemies. Read more
about this in the Game Basics
section.

I hope you enjoy the game, as
well as this document, the
ultimate walkthrough for Kirby:
Canvas Curse!

  +-----------------------------
  + The Menu                    
  +-----------------------------

 Main Game
 ---------
 This is the main game. Travel
 through all the Stages and
 collect as many medals as you
 can.

 Rainbow Run
 -----------
 Play different parts of the
 stages, and earn more medals.
 There are two modes for each
 stage - Line Trial and Time
 Trial. Line Trial means that
 you have to use as little ink
 as possible, while Time Trial
 will require that you complete
 Stages as fast as possible.

 Sub Games
 ---------
 In here, your unlocked Mini
 Games/Boss Battles can be
 played. There are 3 difficulty
 settings for each of them. Beat
 Level 3 and get the A Rank, and
 you will be rewarded with a
 medal. Check the Mini Game and
 Other Medals sections of this
 FAQ for more information.

 Medal Swap
 ----------
 Exchange your medals for
 unlockables like new
 characters, music, new Line
 colors and so on.

 Options
 -------
 Set sound mode, Line color,
 erase data, use the sound test,
 or visit the training. There is
 also a Pictochat section in
 options. If you turn it on,
 your system will search for
 other systems that have
 Pictochat activated. If a
 Pictochat session is found, you
 will get the option to join the
 conversation. If you choose
 YES, the Nintendo DS will turn
 off, and you will lose any
 unsaved progress. Choose NO,
 and you can return to the game.

  +-----------------------------

  + Abilities                   
  +-----------------------------

Abilities play a big role in
Kirby: Canvas Curse. I will tell
you about all of them, what they
are named and what they do. Just
read below. Remember that you
steal abilities by running into
stunned enemies. If you want
information on abilities in-
game, press start to read about
your current ability. There are
11 Abilities in all.


Balloon - this one makes Kirby
able to float in the air. If you
touch
  Kirby, he will get bigger.
  Touching Kirby three times
  will make him pop, and stun
  nearby enemies. Kirby won't
  loose the ability even if he
  looses a Health Point.

Beam - Shoots several beams in a
circle around Kirby. Good
against
  enemies, and useful to remove
  Beam Blocks.

Burning - Boost forward while
burning. Useful for removing
Flame Blocks.

Crash - Touch Kirby to make him
generate a huge blast. Useful
for
  taking out all nearby enemies,
  and activating buttons that
  are found behind walls or
  other obstacles.

Freeze - This one makes Kirby
turn into ice, and then makes
him glide
  along the ground for a little
  while Useful for crunching
  enemies
 and destroying Freeze Blocks.

Missile - Kirby flies through
the air like a Missile. Can
break Missile
  Blocks. Use Rainbow Lines to
  control him.

Needle - Clings you to walls,
useful for rolling into enemies
and
   destroying Needle Blocks.

Spark - Kirby can shoot sparks
upwards. Useful for removing
Spark Blocks.

Tornado - Kirby can now fly
upwards when you tap him, even
while being
  inside No-Paint zones. You
  will get dizzy after a while,
  and have to stop.

Stone - Makes it possible to
fall fast downwards. Great for
sinking
  while being underwater. You
  won't take damage while being
  a stone.
   Not even spikes hurt you.

Wheel - Similar to Sonic the
Hedgehog, Kirby rolls at first
and then
  goes very fast forward,
  destroying and taking down
  anything in his way. Great for
  progressing fast.

bomb on. Touch it for a
explosion.

This walkthrough will show you
how to get Kirby through the
different Stages. If you are
looking for how to find all the
Medals, you will have to first
check the Medal Locations
section of this document.

I recommend activating all the
Switches as fast as you can, in
order to get access to all areas
in the game. Check the Switch
locations part of this document.

It is also important to
understand that I split the
different Stages up in Areas.
When Kirby exits one place, and
enters another, while still
being in the same Stage, he
switches Area. Remember that
this section is for the Main
Game while playing as Kirby.
Also, the enemies, are simply
referred to as "enemies", and
not with their official names.

If you need help with something
else, go to the top of this
document and check out where to
find what you are looking for.

 -------------------------------
   Reddy Land, Plant Plain 1-1
   [KiW001]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 ------
Start by stunning and running
into the two first enemies you
meet. Now, start drawing a nice
Rainbow Line upwards and to the
left. When you get all the way
to the top, there is a Balloon
at the far left. Don't mind
stealing its ability. Drop down
again. There is a medal in the
middle of this area. Not hard to
find. Go all the way right to
exit the area.

 Area 2
 ------

Remove the Balloon ability, and
start rolling right, stunning
and taking out all the enemies
you meet. You will eventually
get to a beam type enemy. Stun
him and roll into him to gain
the beam ability. You should
soon see a Energy Drink, so
drink it. Continue going right,
draw a Rainbow Line to get over
the small hill to your right.
Here, touch the Bomb Block to
get down to your first Medal. Go
up from the hole, and continue
right to the next area.

 Area 3
 ------

Stun the Wheel type enemy and
steal his ability. Go right
quickly until you meet lots of
big Star Blocks on top of each
other. Draw a Rainbow Line in
order to get to the top for an
Energy Drink. Continue right
until you see the end of the
Stage. Don't enter here. Instead
draw a Rainbow Line and get the
Medal that is located a little
to the left of the exit. Now you
can exit the stage as well.

 -------------------------------
   Reddy Land, Tiny Town 1-2
   [KiW002]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 ------

Stun the enemy, and go down the
pipe in front of you. In this
room, there are some stars and
two enemies on some platforms.
Go all the way to the top right,
and take out the three enemies
here. Go down into the pipe to
the far right. When you drop
down, you will see a path of
stars, draw a Rainbow Line along
with the stars to collect them
all, and get a Energy Drink.
Drop down the pipe at the left
side. Run into the checkpoint
and take out the three enemies.
Continue up the pipe. Here, draw
a Rainbow Line and drop down
into the second gap from the
left for a medal. Go right, and
use the bumpers to get up in the
air. Exit the area using the
door on the far right.

 Area 2
 ------

Go right until you get to a room
with lots of cannons. Shoot
yourself to the far left and
activate the Checkpoint. Ignore
the black blocks in the ceiling.
Drop down to continue. From
here, enter the rightmost pipe
for a 1UP and drop down to the
pipe. Take the left pipe this
time. You will get to a room
with a few platforms and some
red enemies walking on them.
Stun the enemies and make your
way to the top. In the next
area, there's a enemy on the
left side. Stun him and steal
his Beam Ability. Grab the
Energy Drink and take the stars
from inside of the Glass Blocks.
Go down and left, and exit
through the pipe. In this area,
there are four enemies. Stun
then all, and run into them one
after the another. Just make
sure to draw steady Rainbow
Lines.

You can also use the Beam
Ability to take out the enemies.
When you have done this, a big
cannon will appear. Enter it and
get blown all the way to the
top, through the black blocks
from the start of Area 2. If you
go to the right once you've
gotten to the top, you will see
a Medal. However, you can't get
it yet, as it has been blocked
behind a Orange Wall. Check out
the Switch Location section of
this FAQ. Now, exit the area by
going to the left.

 Area 3
 ------

Area 3 is pretty much straight
forwards. Just continue to only
way possible, while collecting
stars and defeating enemies if
you want to. When you get to the
green room, there is a
Checkpoint and some spikes.
Close to the spikes, a medal has
been placed. Get it. Continue
until you can exit this stage.

 -------------------------------
   Reddy Land, Ravine Road 1-3
   [KiW003]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 ------

Go right past the waterfall.
Stun and take down three
enemies. You will get to see a
Speedpad. Don't run into it yet.
Instead steal the Beam Ability
of the enemy on the platform
above. Watch out for the spider,
touch the Checkpoint and enter
the Speedpad. Run down the five
or so enemies, and then stun
every enemy you can see in this
room. Make your way to the top
left by drawing Rainbow Lines,
and collect the Medal in the
small cave here. Make your way
to the bottom right and exit the
area.

 Area 2
 ------

Draw Lines to get upwards. In
the small cave to the left,
there is a missile. Stun it
quickly and steal its ability.
Use the Missile Ability to fly
to the top right and blast
through the bars that are
blocking a passage. In here, you
can find a medal. Go further
right, drop down and get to the
next area.

 Area 3
 ------

As you can see, there are
several platforms below you, and
some Bomb Blocks. Touch the Bomb
Blocks and go as far down as you
can. At the bottom there is a
Wheel Type enemy. Steal his
ability and go all the way right
in the next room. There are two
paths, one upper path with a
Checkpoint and a lower one.
Activate the checkpoint, and
then go for the lower one. Use
your stylus to draw Rainbow
Lines until you see a medal
above you. Get it. Then drop
down again, and use the Wheel
ability to get to the far right
side. Now, exit stage at the
top.

 -------------------------------
   Arange Gorge, Ghost Grounds
   2-1 [KiW004]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 ------

In this level, there are lots of
bubbles. Touch them to get free.
Make your way to the right until
you see a Checkpoint at the
entrance of a tree. Make your
way up here, and let the cannons
take you all the way down. There
is a Energy Drink inside the
tree. Let the rightmost cannon
shoot you out. Continue to the
right and be sure to steal a
Burning Ability here. Go all the
way to the right. When you see
the exit door, start drawing a
Rainbow Line and go high up.
There is a Medal behind some
Fire Blocks. Use your Burning
Ability to get through. Now exit
area.

 Area 2
 ------

Go a little right and draw a
Rainbow Line over the cannon.
Make your way down and then go
left. You will get to some
platforms with a Spark Type
enemy. Steal its ability and
jump into the nearby cannon. Use
the Spark Ability to clear out
the Spark Blocks and draw a
Rainbow Line to get up to the
area the blocks where blocking.
There's lots of stars here. Now
use the bumper to get higher up,
and then go right. There's
another area with stars here.
When you have taken the stars,
go left, watch out for enemies
and draw a Rainbow Line to the
left so that you can get to the
place where there are lots of
spikes below some Glass Blocks.
When you've passed the spikes,
go upwards and then right
through some Star Blocks. Take
down the enemy here to earn his
ability, the Beam Ability. Go
further left and collect all the
stars, now jump up, and then go
left to return to where you took
out the Star Block.

Now go upwards using the cannon
at the far left. There is an
enemy close to the wall mounted
cannon here, but don't steal his
ability. You won't want to have
any ability right now. Go right
and you will meet a Spark Type
enemy. Steal his ability, and
don't lose it. Take the Energy
Drink that's nearby. Now go a
little back, and jump upwards
where the red enemy is
patrolling. Then go right and
up. Don't enter the cannon.
Instead, draw a Rainbow Line to
get up to the far upper right
side of the screen. There is a
medal here, behind some Spark
Blocks. Move to the far left,
and exit the area. There are two
doors, one below and one at your
floor, but they take you to the
same place.

 Area 3
 -------

Go as far right as you can,
don't drop down any place, and
enter the Huge Cannon at the far
right. Shoot yourself out and
collect the stars in the room
you arrive at. Drop down through
the winders. Go right and
activate the Checkpoint.
Unfortunately there is a Orange
Floor here, so you will need to
have pressed the Orange Switch
to enter here. Above you there
are two small Star Blocks touch
them and go up to the room they
were blocking and collect all
the stars. The rest of the Stage
is pretty straightforward, just
watch out for the spiked ceiling
close to the exit.

   2-2 [KiW005]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 ------

Make your way to the right, use
the Sticky Pads to help you out
so that you don't fall down and
die. You will get to a place
where you can barely see a black
Hidden Door. Use Rainbow Lines
to go inside and collect a
Medal. Go out again and continue
going right. You will get to the
exit once you've passed a enemy
cannon.

 Area 2
 ------

Drop down through all the
winders. When you see lots of
Stone Blocks, touch the Bomb
Block at the foot of them all.
There is a medal between all the
enemies that were trapped
inside. Go further down, and
keep to the far left. Steal the
Spark Ability of the enemy here,
and get the nearby Energy Drink.
Drop down into the building
below. Three enemies will
appear, they look like bombs.
Tap each of them twice, and then
tap each of them once more to
blow them up. Repeat this two
times and exit the area.

 Area 3
 -------

The area is very
straightforward. There are some
No-Paint zones, here you will
not be able to draw Rainbow
Lines. When you get to the place
where there is a pole stopping
you, touch the Star Blocks that
are located to your right, and
then continue forward. At the
end of the Area, there is a
enemy. Steal its Tornado
Ability, and fly inside the No-
Paint zone. At a platform there
is a Medal. There is also a 1UP
below a Bomb Block. Now, exit
level.

 Area 1
 ------

Allright. Start going right, and
draw Rainbow Lines to get over
the lava. The cannons you meet
are your friends, so use them.
You will eventually get to a
Checkpoint and a Energy Drink.
Continue right, and you will see
a medal under a platform. Touch
the Bomb Block the medal lies on
to make it blow up to you. Just
don't stand at the middle of the
platform. Now touch the Bomb
Block to your right, and
continue. You will get to the
next area after you've passed a
lava passage.

 Area 2
 ------

This looks tricky with all the
lava around, but just get into
the cannon to your right and
you'll be ok. Just touch Kirby
when he gets stuck on a Sticky
Pad, and let the cannons to the
rest. You will get to a spiked
enemy. But you should be able to
avoid him by either having luck
while being transported by the
Sticky Pad, or by touching Kirby
and doing a jump. You will get
to a new Checkpoint. Collect the
stars nearby and continue right.
There is a Flame Winder and some
enemies ahead, so be careful.
You might want to steal a
Burning Ability from one of the
enemies. Continue right, and the
the cannon shoot you to the top
right part of the room. You will
see a medal, but continue left.
You will also see a Maximum
Tomato. Go left still. After a
while you will get to see a
small Bomb Block. Touch it, and
draw Rainbow Lines so that you
can go back to the right and get
the Maximum Tomato and the
Medal. Now Draw Lines and go all
the way left again and exit the
area.

 Area 3
 ------

Ok, the lava will rise higher,
so be fast. get into the cannon
and start dashing through the
cave. You will be able to
activate two Checkpoints and get
the Flaming ability. Use this
ability to move faster. When you
get to the big room with
platforms, draw Rainbow Lines
and get yourself to the upper
right edge of the screen for a
Medal. Get to the upper middle
of the screen and exit the
stage.

 Area 1
 ------

Start going into the ruins.
Watch out for two big balls or
bullets, and roll over them
using your Rainbow Lines. You
will get to a door that is
shutting itself up and down.
Don't get squeezed here, but
dash through, and draw a Rainbow
Line to avoid falling to certain
death. Get into the cannon at
the far right side and travel
upwards. Be quick, and get under
the platform to your left, as a
new ball will roll towards you.
Repeat this, and activate the
Checkpoint. Ok, the water here
is not dangerous, but the spear
throwing enemy is. Continue left
until you get to a cannon. Shoot
yourself upwards using this
cannon, and draw Lines to get
yourself to the upper left
corner of the room you just
entered for a Medal. Now touch
the Star Blocks to your right
and continue rolling this way.
Watch out for the creatures that
try to eat you. Now, you will
get to some red boxes. Enter the
second-from bottom one, and you
will get to a dark place. Go
right to the nearby bumper and
touch the light. Be fast and
head to the door you see to your
left once the room has been
lightened.

 Area 2
 -------

Enter the cannon on the left
side of the room and go all the
way to the top. Touch the small
Bomb Blocks while you are
falling down again - all of
them. If you miss a few, go up
again and try once more. There
is a medal on one of the Bomb
Blocks, so make sure to pick it
up once you get down again.
Well, a new cannon also fell
down along with the Medal, so
get in it. Once you've arrived
at the top, you will see some
Spiked Winders. Touch the purple
spot on it to make it stop and
start as you wish. Place the
spikes so that you won't run
into them when you draw your
Rainbow Lines. Proceed upwards
until you get to a Checkpoint.
Well, you will get to a Wind
Cannon. Above it, there is a
flame that appears now and then.
Launch yourself upwards once the
flame has gone away. Continue
doing this with all the Wind
Cannons until you meet an enemy
with the Rock Ability. Steal it,
and enter a Hidden Door that is
just to the right of this enemy.
In here, use the Rock Ability to
destroy some Stone Blocks, and
activate the Orange Switch! Now,
use the door to your left to
exit the door, and then go to
the upper left to exit the area.

Medal all the way to the right.
Watch out for cannons and
continue left. Take the upper
fork and steal the Flaming

at the end of the path. You will
get to a checkpoint. Go right

the platform you meet, there is
an enemy with the Stone Ability,
so steal it. Drop down the pipe
at the far right, and activate
the Checkpoint. Watch out for
enemies and continue to the left
edge of the room. Here, drop
down, to a wooden piece that has
been carved down close to some
stones. Use the Stone Ability to
drop down on the wooden piece.
Do not enter the pipe below you.
Now, when the stones to your
left are gone, enter the left
room, and go upwards. Get rid of
the Stone Ability, and steal the
Crash Ability from the enemy
walking on a platform above the
water. Go all the way down to
the bottom of the water, and use
the Crash Ability to activate
the button found below all the
stones. Get the Medal, and exit
though the bottom right. Touch
the Maximum Tomato to trigger an
event where lots of fishes and
rocks will attack. Touch the
rocks to break them, and take
out all the fishes by stunning
them, and then dashing into
them. A new Maximum Tomato will
appear, and you can exit the
area by using the door that came
with the Tomato!

  Area 3
  -------

Lots of Blocks in this area.
Well, make your way right and go
downwards. When you're at the
bottom floor, you can see the
exit door, but don't use it.
Instead go all right if you
haven't already. A little above
the ground floor, there is a
hidden door with a medal inside.
This requires that you have
pressed the Green Switch.

at the upper platform if you
need one. Continue to the right,
tap the Bomb Block to continue.
Drop down and you will get to
some more water, and a
Checkpoint at the other side.
Continue rolling the only way
you can, and you'll get to a gap
with a circle of stars above.
Use Rainbow Lines to get over
this gap, and do the same with
the next gap. Move into the
cannon, and have it shoot you so
that you run into the stars
while being mid air. Exit the
area at the far right.


 Area 2
 ------

Start rolling to the left. A
stone will roll after you, so
make sure you draw Rainbow Lines
to transport Kirby to the top of
the small rising in front of
him. If you are too late, you
will loose a Health Point when
the stone hits you. There are
two other stones further left.
Just dash to outrun them, and
touch the Bomb Block at the far
left. There is a Checkpoint
nearby, so activate it. Now you
will see some water below you.
Get into it and dash to the
left. Inside the room you will
get into, there is a Medal. Now
go back, and dash to the right
instead. Touch the Spiked
Winders to stop them, so that
Kirby can travel past them
safely. Now, just head further
ahead. You will get to a room
with lots of buttons. It doesn't
matter what buttons you press,
as long as you get to the far
left side of the room. In other
words, it does not matter what
doors you go through. Well, you
will get to a new checkpoint
after you've gone through some
pipes. To the right, there are
some stones above some gaps.
Four in all. Dash Kirby as fast
as you can, while drawing
Rainbow Lines below him to make
him safely get to the far right
side. Here, there is an Evil
Block, so avoid it. Well, at the
far right, you can exit the
area.


 Area 3
 ------

This area is pretty straight
forward. Travel through the
water until you get to a room
with three buttons on the floor.
Touch them so that they all turn
red, and then enter the small
cave that opened on the bottom
right. Run into the button here,
and continue right through the
wall. There's some arrows on the

make a Medal drop down once you
arrive at the other side of the
Mega Bumpers. Continue right,
and watch out for laserbeams.
Draw Rainbow Lines above Kirby
in order to protect him from
beams coming from above. At the
end of the area, there are
several laserbeams, so be very
careful. There is also an Energy
Drink here, just before you get
to the exit.

 Area 2
 ------

Start by rolling left. Watch out
for the flying enemy that will
attack from behind, and touch
the Star Blocks the two cannons
are standing on. Now, use the
Rainbow Lines you draw to get to
the other side of the gap.
Continue travelling and get into
the cannon. You will arrive
pretty far right. Drop down and
go right. Steal a Missile
Ability from one of the enemies
and drop down at the far left
again. Now, the exit is close,
but don't enter. Instead go
right, and touch the Bomb Block
that is holding up the rightmost
cannon. Enter the cannon and
shoot yourself forward. You will
blast through some Black Blocks
and then arrive in a room with
lots of enemies. Here, use the
Missile Ability to destroy the
blocks below. In the room that
is hidden below these blocks,
there is a Medal. Now exit the
Medal room, and get into the
real exit door.

 -------------------------------


 Area 1
 ------

A hint for this Stage, is to use
the Map at your upper screen to
always check where the spikes
are placed. Well, start rolling
and make your way to the first
checkpoint. Nothing special
until then, apart from standard
enemies. Below this checkpoint,
you can see a medal behind some
blocks. However, to get through
the blocks you will have to get
the Needle Ability You will have
to continue in the darkness
until you meet an enemy with
this ability, and then backtrack
to get the medal. This enemy is
quite far away, so travel to the
right for some time. He's found
inside a small cave after you've
passed another two checkpoints.
Well, when you've got the medal,
go all the way to the right,
past the cannons, and exit the
area. Make sure you don't drop
the Needle Ability

 Area 2
 ------

With your Needle Ability, break
through the Blocks to your
right, and draw Rainbow Lines to
get to the upper left corner of
the room. "Rest" at platforms to
regain Ink if you are about to
run out. Once you've got the
medal from the upper left, drop
down, enter the room you started
in when you got to Area 2, and
make your way to the top.
Collect the Energy Drink near
the exit, and exit the area.

 Area 3
 ------

Make your way downwards, between
all the spikes. To avoid
touching them, take "pit-stops"
at the Wind Cannons, and calm
down. Draw a Rainbow Line to
continue further. Get to the
bottom part of the room, and
exit.

 Area 4
 ------

Complete darkness. Scary? I
think so. Well, go left, and
draw a Rainbow Line in the
middle of the room, so that
Kirby can travel on it. Ignore
the Medal on your map, and
continue further left until you
see a light. Touch it to light
up the area. Go back and touch
the Bomb Block that you can see
here. Now, you can get the
medal. Go all the way right and
exit area.

get onto the Sticky Pad and
travel upwards. Travel right
past the spikes, and into the
cannon. Shoot upwards, and start
going left Destroy the two first
Star Blocks, so that one enemy
falls down onto the electric
floor. Use Rainbow Lines to get
up to the Star Blocks, and
collect 1UP. Use the cannons to
the left to get upwards to the
next floor, and draw Lines to
make a safe roll through all the
spikes found after the first
Checkpoint. Get into the pipe on
the far right, and watch out for
enemies on your way.

You will now see some dangerous
cannons. Get onto the Sticky Pad
and sit on it until you reach
the top. Get past the upper
cannon without being hit, and
drop down so that you land on
another Sticky Pad. Protect
Kirby from the cannon to your
left, and then jump over to yet
another Pad. Continue protecting
Kirby from cannons using Rainbow
Lines until you reach the top of
the room on the right side. This
can be pretty tricky without
being hit even once, but you can
do it! When you're done with the
Sticky Pads, roll left, stun the
three enemies, and exit the
area.

 Area 2
 ------

This area is a little complex to
write about, but bear with it.
Allright, touch the Bomb Block
below you to destroy the floor.
Get down in the pipe to the
right, and start moving left,
rolling between the spiked floor
and ceiling using Rainbow Lines.
Use the pipe at the far left,
and now get up to the room above
the spikes on the left wall. You
will see a medal above you, but
continue into the pipe on the
left. Here, go down, and
carefully draw Rainbow Lines
along the stars, to avoid
running into the spikes. At the
bottom, go to the right, and
enter the Sticky Pad. Jump to
the next Pad, and repeat this.
You will eventually get into a
No Paint zone, so jump off to
the other side when your Pad
stops.

To deactivate the red port,

until they all turn red. Not
that the red port back at the
start of the area will also
disappear. Get to the top of the

activate the checkpoint. Touch
the Bomb Block, and then go
left. Close to the blue port
here, there is a button. Roll
onto it, drop down, and go left.
Press another button, and go up
where the spikes on the left
wall can be found. You will now
see the medal again, but this
time, go into the left pipe as
well. Head upwards now and touch
the Bomb Block at the top. Enter
the cannon, and shoot Kirby into
the air, through some Black
Blocks. well, go right into the
No Paint zone, taking out
enemies and dashing until you
get to a blue port. Open it by
touching the buttons below and
making them all blue. The blue
port back at the start of the
area will also go away. Continue
right, activate the Checkpoint,
and drop down after having
touched a Bomb Block.

Now, in this room there are lots
of Glass Blocks. Get downwards
and touch the button in the
middle of the room to blow up
the floor. Drop down. Now you
are back at the start again.
Activate the button at the
bottom o the room. The wall
above will blow up. Get to where
the wall was located, and turn
all buttons Yellow to unlock the
yellow port that blocked the
entrance to the exit door. Well,
go left now instead of exiting,
and up the pipe at the far left.
Go right between the spikes
here, and run into the switch
you will get to. Now the medal
finally drops down. Go get it,
and then return to exit area.
Whew!

 Area 3
 ------
There's lots of Star Blocks in
this area. Destroy them to get
going, and steal a Beam ability
from one of the enemies.
Continue going to the right, and
touch Star Blocks to make them
disappear. Try to not touch the
lowest placed Blocks, as they
are nice to roll on past the
gaps. After going a little
upwards you will get to a
Checkpoint. Continue, taking out
the Blocks that hold the cannons
up. Continue right, and collect
the Energy Drink and the 1UP
that can be found on the Star
Blocks. At the far right the
stage exit is located. Roll OVER
the exit for a medal. Now, you
can exit stage.

in front of you. Dash like crazy
to avoid the snowballs that roll
behind you. Draw a Line at the
end of the path, to start going
left after you've dropped down.
You will get to a Checkpoint.
Above, there is a door to the
right. The wall covering it is
fake, so just roll into the door
and get the medal. Exit this
room.

Enter the cannon to the left,
and get into the Huge Cannon you
will run into after a while. Now
go left, watch out for snowballs
and continue rolling. The next
thing that happens is that you
will enter a cannon facing

at the Checkpoint. Roll down to
the left, and dash to avoid the
snowballs. Watch out for the gap
at the end, where you should
draw a Rainbow Line to get past.

the gap.

 Area 2
 ------

Touch the wall in front of you
twice to break it. Get up when
you see a hole in the ceiling.

the snowman, and use it to
destroy the Freeze Blocks to the
left. From here, roll all the
way left, and start getting
upwards. Now, touch the big Star
Block that the cannon is sitting
on to make it fall down. Now get
the Medal found at the other
side of the wall that the cannon
was guarding. Now destroy the
Freeze Blocks to the right, and
then drop down and go to the
right over the gap, and into the
room at the other side. There's
a path going down. If you go
down there, there are some
stars, anyways, continue right
into the next room. It has a
Checkpoint in the middle.

Further right out of the room,
there is a Wind Cannon. To the
right of this cannon, and a
little down, there is a wall.
Break it and continue right by
drawing rainbow Lines. After
some falling ice and another
wall, there is a room with the
Green Switch hidden inside. This
room is a No Paint Zone. Move
both of the Ice Blocks with
arrows on to the left using your
stylus, and enter the cannon on
the far right to be shot into
the Green Switch. Now exit this
room. Well, now you're back.
Just go a little right, and exit
the area.

 Area 3

left part of the room to make
more Ice Blocks fall down. Enter
the small cave that got
uncovered, press the button in
here, and go back to the start

above you. Ok, get up to the
upper left again, and go right
to continue. Steal the Freeze
Ability from the enemy, and drop

ease your fall. You will start
rolling down to the left, and
reach a Checkpoint. After a
while, you will get to a place
where there's free fall
downwards. Watch out for spikes
and touch the Bomb Block that is
mounted in the wall close to the
next Checkpoint. Run into the
button to the left of the Bomb
Block, and enter the cave that
opened. A big ball will roll and
break some Black Blocks below
you to the left. First, enter
the cave the ball came from for
a 1UP and then go to where to
ball broke the Black Blocks and
enter the door there for a
Medal. Now, get out again, drop
as far down as possible, and
draw Rainbow Lines to get to the
far left, and exit stage.
Rainbow Lines are more effective
than the Sticky Pad here. Just
watch out for ice spikes coming
from above.

   Bloo Hills, Dungeon Dome 5-2
   [KiW014]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 ------

Steal the Stone Ability and drop
down into the water. Make all
the Bomb Blocks you meet
explode, and continue right over
the spikes. You can just roll
over them if you want to. You
will see on your map that there
is a Medal behind some Blocks to
your right. Ignore this, and
continue upwards while
destroying falling stones, until
you can activate the Checkpoint
at the surface. Roll right and
dash when two stones fall down.
Now you will meet an enemy with
the Beam Ability Steal it, and
then go back to the Blocks that
were preventing you from getting
to the Medal. Take the Medal,
and go back up, all the way to
the right. Drop down in the
water, and stop the Spiked
Winders in order to not touch
them. Continue going right while
being underwater, and then go up
to the surface. What out for a
falling stone just before you
get up from the water. Steal the
Stone Ability from one of the
enemies up here, and get the
Energy Drink as well. Go right,
drop all the way down to the
bottom of the water, but
remember to press the buttons
that open the ports, and exit
area.

 Area 2
 -----

Start going to the right and
steal the Wheel Ability from the
enemy you meet. Roll to the far
right, and then drop down and
destroy the Blocks that are
placed around a button. Press
this button to make a chain
explosion start. Now, you need
to draw Rainbow Lines below
Kirby so that he can roll all
the way to the far left, damn
fast without crashing into one
of the walls, the floor or the
ceiling. This can be tricky, but
just draw the Lines slightly
below Kirby, and make sure they
are flat. When you get to the
far left, there is another
button, but this time you will
have to go to the right. Get to
the far right, just as you went
to the far left a moment ago.
You can't afford to hit the
spikes below you or crash. If
you do, die, and restart the
area. Well, now you are at the
far right if you made it over
the spikes fast enough.

Another button is waiting for
you here, and guess what, now
you need to use the Wheel
Ability to go left again, after
having pressed the button. At
the far left, you will get into
a cannon. Shoot yourself to the
right, and you will get to the
second Medal of this stage. Now
go left, and drop down into the
gap close to the arrow-formed
stars. You should also activate
the checkpoint you run into, but
avoiding this is rather hard.
Down here, you should get onto
one of the two Sticky Pads, and
stun all the enemies, and then
make Kirby run into them while
going around on the Sticky Pad.
Some bombs, and enemies on the
floor will appear, but you can
easily take them down. When
you've done this, a Maximum
Tomato will appear, and you will
be able to exit the area.

 Area 3
 ------

Steal the Spark Ability from one
of the green enemies, and
continue rolling through the
path system until you get to the
Checkpoint close to several Star
Blocks. Make your way upwards
and then right, until you see
some spikes above you. Here, the
floor can be destroyed by
touching it. Drop down, then go
left through the fake wall, and
collect your Medal. Now get into
the cannon on the right side of
the room, and shoot yourself
upwards until you reach a new
Checkpoint. Go left, drop down
at the far left side, and
continue until you reach a new
Checkpoint, and a arrow made out
of stars that's pointing
upwards. You can get an Energy
Drink by going through a fake
wall to the right. Now go to the
top. On the way, there are
enemies that will attack from
the walls, but you can stun them
by touching them. There's also a
Checkpoint, but you won't need
to touch it, as the Stage exit
at the top is pretty close.

 -------------------------------
   Bloo Hills, Canvas Canyon 5-3
   [KiW015]
 -------------------------------


 Area 1
 ------

Go upwards, take down the two
enemies, and steal the Beam
Ability Now, at the top you need
to go to the right through the
air, but this requires a little
more effort than it usually
does, as there's a wind blowing
against you. Just draw Rainbow
Lines starting behind Kirby, and
going to the right. You will
soon get to a Checkpoint. Keep
going right. The wind will blow
even harder. Check your map, and
you will see an opening at the
top of the area. Go there, and
pass the fake ceiling to enter a
room and get a Medal. Exit this
room. Now go to the far right.
The cannons that you can drop
into on your way might be of
help. There is an Energy Drink
close to the Exit Door.

 Area 2
 ------

Steal the Tornado Ability from
the nearby enemy and start
flying upwards, touching the
Bomb Blocks to clear your way.
You will get to a Checkpoint at
the top. There is also a
laserbeam enemy here. Touch him
several times to make him blow
up. Continue flying slightly to
the right past where the
laserbeam enemy was, and then go
upwards. When you get to the top
here, start rolling left, and
dash under the yellow jumping
enemies to drop down through the
floor and get to a Medal. Now
head up again, and activate the
Checkpoint above a small
platform. Now head to the far
top and exit the area.

 Area 3
 ------

Head left, and continue
following the only path you can
go, until you get to several
connected enemies that are going
around and around in a circle.
Draw Rainbow Lines at the
outside, so that Kirby can
travel safely past them. You
will get to a Maximum Tomato and
a Checkpoint. To the left and
down, there is a cannon. If you
have activated the Blue Switch,
you can time the shootout so
that you hit the first row of
Black Blocks mid air. There is a
Medal for you at the other side,
but if you haven't got to the
Blue Switch yet, just drop all
the way down. Well, go right and
continue upwards. Destroy the
blocks that are in your way. The
final room is a room with
platforms and Spiked Winders. At
the top, you can exit the Stage.

 -------------------------------
  Omarine Zone, Collapse Castle
  6-1 [KiW016]
 -------------------------------


 Area 1
 ------

Touch the light to get to see
the area. Go right over the
electric floor, and press the
button. Now go back left, and
downwards. There are some
swinging enemies here, and some
Wind Cannons. Use the Wind
Cannons if you get too close to
the enemies. At the bottom to
the right, there is a Medal. Now
go far left and activate a
Checkpoint and light up the area
again. Now drop down and stop
the Spiked Winders to get to the
far right. Drop down, and take
the first fork the the left. Go
between the laserbeams and run
into a button. Head back again
and go further down, then left.
You will get to a Checkpoint, so
activate it. Well, go further
left over the electronic floor,
and continue until you get to
the exit.

 Area 2
 -------

Press the Ice Block to move it,
and enter the pipe to the right.
Now move the Ice Blocks above
you and go right again. One of
the Ice Blocks you moved a
moment ago, has to be moved back
so that the new block here can
be removed afterwards. Now, go
down and activate a Checkpoint.
Start rolling left, move all the
Ice Blocks to neutralize the
laserbeam, and continue. The
next laser can be stopped with
Rainbow Lines. Drop down and get
a Energy Drink. Move over the
spikes. Move the Block, activate
a Checkpoint and start going
left, and pass the colored
ports. In this room, press the
button in the far left corner,
but remember to protect Kirby
from the laser. A new button
will appear in the right of the
room, and finally the last
button will appear in the middle
of the room. Now, continue left
through the port. There's a new
checkpoint, and a No Paint Zone
at that. Now, just dash to the
right like a mad cow. Run over
all the buttons. At the end,
behind the exit, there is a Blue
Wall that hides a Medal.
Remember that you can only get
the medal if you have activated
the Blue Switch.

 Area 3
 ------

Get into the cannon to your
right, make it blast you into
the bigger cannon further right,
and then blast right and
slightly downwards, to bump into
another big cannon. Now blast
downwards, and you will end up
in a big cannon higher up in the
room. From here, blast to the
right slightly upwards and you
will get to a cannon standing on
a Bomb Block. Touch this block,
and time the shootout, so that
you get the medal behind the
Black Blocks below. The rest of
the Stage is straight forward.
When you get to the Sticky Pad,
just defend Kirby from the
flames using Rainbow Lines, and
when you get to the stones,
touch them a few times to take
them out. Let the Sticky Pad
take you all the way to the
Stage Exit.

 -------------------------------
  Omarine Zone, Volatile Volcano
  6-2 [KiW017]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 -------

First, let me say that the music
in this Stage is of the best in
any game on the Nintendo DS. Go
composer! Anyways, head right
and let the crane pick you up.
Drop down when the crane stops,
go right, and get picked up by a
second crane. Drop down then it
stops. Draw a Rainbow Line in
the correct height, to transport
Kirby under the lava ceiling,
but over the bottom. You will
get to a Checkpoint with a
cannon to the right. Ignore the
cannon and go through the fake
wall further right. Dash like
crazy and run over a button.

Continue dashing to avoid
falling down, as this is a No
Pain Zone, and the floor will
blow up. You will get a Medal.
Go into the cannon on the far
right, and make it shoot you
back left. Draw a Rainbow Line
right outside of the No Paint
Zone, as you will fall down if
you don't do this. Now, you can
enter the cannon to the right of
the Checkpoint. Go up and right
past four enemies until you meet
a new crane. I usually ignore
it, and keep drawing Lines to
get Kirby past all the lava, but
you might want to hang onto the
crane. There are some enemies in
the way, but you can easily stun
them. There is a Wind Cannon
some distance ahead - get there.
Even further to the left there
is a Checkpoint and a Energy
Drink. Now, close to the Exit
Door at the far left, there is a
No Paint Zone divided with a
Paint Zone in the middle. Draw a
long Rainbow Line to take Kirby
almost to the top, and then a
small one for the final
distance. Steal the Freeze
Ability from the enemy here, and
exit the area.

 Area 2
 ------

It's important that you have the
freeze ability and don't loose
it! Go to the far right, use the
Freeze Ability to destroy some
blocks, press a button and make
your way to the far left through
all the lava. Drop down, and go
to the far right again. Just
watch out so that you don't die
falling down a gap. Close to the
end, the Medal is located in a
small cave above you. Now get
down, and go right out of the
screen. Now go right over two
small volcanoes and drop into
the gap. Some Evil Blocks will
appear. Touch the Bomb Blocks at
the left and right side, and
start moving Kirby to the sides
in order to make the Evil Blocks
fall down the gaps. Just be
quick and return to the floor
before the Evil Blocks hit you.
When the two Evil Blocks are
gone, another one will appear at
the centre of the room. Blow up
the floor here, and use Lines to
avoid the block. Once is enough.
A Maximum Tomato will appear,
and so will the exit. Use the
exit.

 Area 3
 ------

The lava is rising and falling.
Make your way right to the
Checkpoint. Here, you will see a
locked port on the lower fork.
Take the upper one, press a
button and go back left. Now you
can enter the port, and grab a
medal. Just watch out so that
you do this when the lava has
fallen, and not slow either.
When you get to the medal, you
can "rest" in a small hole where
the lava can't reach. Continue
right, and be careful so that
the lava doesn't get you. If you
get squeezed, you die. At the
far right, the Stage Exit is
waiting.

 -------------------------------
  Omarine Zone, Silent Seabed
  6-3 [KiW018]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 ------

Steal the Stone Ability from the
enemy, and use it to drop ALL
the way down. Move the Ice
Blocks you have to move in order
to get through, but ignore
anything else. Go through the
pipe at the bottom, then a
little right. Move the Ice Block
in the ceiling close to the
second checkpoint, and get
inside the door that was behind
it for a Medal. Exit the room,
and go right. Get up the pipe,
and get to the absolute top of
the room. Avoid enemies, of
course. Exit the area at the
top.

  Area 2
  ------

Go left past two Speedpads. Go
up when you see the Spiked
Winder, and press the button to
the left when you've gotten a
little upwards. The ceiling will
break, so draw a Line above
Kirby to prevent him from
hitting the electric ceiling. Go
right past a Speedpad and more
electric ceiling/floor, and you
will get to a Checkpoint. Head
upwards, press the button at the
top and steal the Stone Ability
Now press the Bomb Block on the
left wall and go left through
where the wall was. Drop down,
get past a Spiked Winder and
press a new button. Make your
way upwards to a new checkpoint.
Go right, then down. Go to the
right of the Spiked Winder and
break the wall with a '!' sign
on it, Go right and then further
down between all the stones.
Press the button. Get back to
the previous checkpoint, and
then choose the upper path with
the No Paint Zone. Draw Lines
beneath the No Paint Zone to
make Kirby reach the far right.
Watch out for enemies. Now you
can exit the area to the right
of the button you pressed, as
you recently got a medal!

  Area 3
  ------
The Camera will be coming from
behind, trying to crush you.
Just make your way to the far
right, ignoring abilities. Drop
down, and start going left. At
the end, close to the Stage
Exit, there is a Medal above a
current going downwards. Place
yourself under the medal, draw a
Line so that Kirby does not fall
down in the gap below the
current, and then press the
nearby Bomb Block to make the
Medal fall down to you.


 -------------------------------
  Wonder Lilane, Frozen Fantasy
  7-1 [KiW019]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 ------

Run into the button to make the
Ice Blocks above of you fall
down. Get up here, and steal the
Freeze Ability from the enemy.
There is a Medal to the right
behind some Ice Blocks. There is
a button nearby as well. Run
into it and then go left, up
between the spikes, to the right
past the Electronic
floor/ceiling but do not press
the button at the other side.
Head past it, drop down, and
press the button you find here.
Now you can go get the Medal you
saw at the start. Head back up,
press the button you ignored a
few moments ago, and a wall will
drop down. Press the button in
here to break the ceiling, and
continue further upwards. Take
the left path past all the
spikes, and press the button you
get to, and activate the
checkpoint. Head back, and take
the upper path. Watch out for
spiders and get the Energy Drink
you will get to see. The rest of
the area is pretty
straightforward. Avoid spikes,
touch snowballs to break them,
and exit the area at the upper
left after having pressed a
button.

 Area 2
 ------

To get the Blue Switch:

Go the the right and drop onto a
Sticky Platform. Touch it to
start going to the right. Stun
enemies. When the platforms goes
upwards, touch it again right
before it starts going to the
right, and dash off it. Kirby
will drop along a line of stars,
and land on a Sticky Pad below
the old one. This can be tricky,
but by following what I said,
you can do it. The new Pad will
go to the right and stop close
to a door. Enter this door. In
here, first take out all the
Bomb Blocks you can see, but be
sure to take out the one closest
to you last. Now, the ball above
will start rolling. Get to the
right quickly, and press the
button you will meet. The ball
will drop down and activate the
Blue Switch if you were fast
enough. If you fail, you can
drop down and die at the far
right, and then restart the
room. After activating the
Switch, head out of the room.
The checkpoint is just above you
now, so drop onto the Sticky Pad
and get there.

To Get Frozen Fantasy Medal 2:

At the start of the area, draw a
Rainbow Line and dash onto it to
fly up to the Sticky Pad above
the lower one. You will be taken
to the medal. Now, head right
all the way to the Checkpoint.

Go to the right. You will get to
some splitted No Paint Zones.
There's some poles stopping you
so that you don't fall down.
When the enemy is at the right
position, dash to make Kirby
bump into the block in the air.
Then, when Kirby gets close to
the Paint Zone again, draw a
line to "save" him. Repeat until
you get to a new Sticky Pad. The
last thing in the area, are some
Sticky Pads in a No Paint Zone.
Dash from one Pad to the another
until you reach the exit.
Falling down is not dangerous.

 Area 3
 ------

Now, this area is quite a mess.
The paragraphs below explain how
to do this, but please excuse me
if it's too much to read at
once. Blame the developers.

Drop down into the water, get up
to the Green Button and then
open the port to go further
upwards. Roll between the
laserbeams, and get the Energy
Drink at the right side of the
room. Drop down in the middle to
activate a button, and then drop
further down through where the
purple port was blocking the
way. Drop down into the water,
and take the left fork. There is
another button a little to the
left. Head further left into a
new room and activate the
Checkpoint. At the top, you can
get out of this room, and press
a button inside a small cave to
the left. Continue upwards,
press the two buttons in the
room where the Stage Exit is
located, but don't exit the
stage yet.

Go further upwards, then go up
again when you meet an Evil
Block. Go right, press a button
then drop down, and get into the
room with the spiked Winders.
Stop them to make the whole
thing easier. To the right in
this room, there is a new
button. Press it and collect the
Maximum Tomato to its left. Now
head further upwards and break
the ceiling by touching it. Go
right through the fake wall and
drop down to the medal. Go the
the left, and make your way to
the Stage Exit.

 -------------------------------
  Wonder Lilane, Mad Mechanism
  7-2 [KiW020]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 ------

Roll right, break the wall and
get down into the Pipe. Here,
the floor will be moving up and
down. When you get to places
where the ceiling suddenly gets
higher than usual, wait here
until the floor does a very huge
move. Then, continue rolling.
You will get to the first
Checkpoint. There will be some
spikes, and you will see a Medal
above you behind some Blocks.
Don't go too far right here, but
wait until you can see a small
Bomb Block at the lower part of
the place. Press it, and make
the Medal drop down to you. Be
sure not to continue to the
right before the floor has done
its murderous move. Just
continue to the right, watching
out for the floor, and exit the
area at the far right.

 Area 2
 ------

Time for a No Paint Zone. Roll
slowly to the right until you
see the three enemies, time a
dash move, and draw a Rainbow
Line in the small place that is
a Paint Zone to send Kirby
flying up to the Medal in the
upper right part of the room.
Continue, and drop down in the
second gap when the crane picks
you up. Touch the enemies to
blow them up, and you get to a
new crane. Drop down into the
third gap. You will get to a
room with four buttons blocked
by some blocks. Bombs will
appear. Run into them to make
them take out the blocks at all
four edges of the room. A few
times, another kind of bomb will
appear. Touch these using your
stylus to blow them up. When all
buttons have been pressed, you
can exit the room.

 Area 3
 ------

Roll right, defend Kirby from
laserbeams and make it onto a
Sticky Pad. At the end of the
run, dash off the pad, and land
on a new Sticky Pad below that
is standing still. Jump off to
the right, and draw Lines to
safely transport Kirby to the
Checkpoint to the left. Draw
Lines to go back up to the
right, and touch the Bomb Block
that is pretty high up on the
wall to the left of the Sticky
Pad that was not moving. Now,
you can go get a Medal, as some
Blocks have been blown up, and a
path has been uncovered above
the Checkpoint. The rest of he
level is pretty much
straightforward. Drop down,
continue left, defend Kirby from
laserbeams, go up between all
the electric walls, and exit the
Stage in the middle of the last
room.

 -------------------------------
  Wonder Lilane, Spectacle Space
  7-3 [KiW021]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 ------

From the start, go right.
Collect the Energy Drink at the
far right, and then break the
white wall up to the left by
touching it. Go left through
where the wall as placed, and
drop down. Draw Lines to
transport Kirby all the way to a
Medal. Now go up past a thin
platform. Go up and left and you
will reach a Checkpoint after a
while. From there, go further
upwards. Continue rolling
between spikes until you reach
the Exit Door. Just don't use up
all your Ink.

 Area 2
 ------

Go to the upper left corner of
the room for 1UP. Now head for
the upper right corner and press
the Green Button there. Now drop
straight down to the lower right
corner and pick up a Medal, but
watch out for the ground, it's
dangerous. Head for the lower
left corner of the room and
press the Purple Button. Now get
back to the start of the area,
and touch all the four corners
of the red square, so that all
corners turn to red. Now you can
exit the area,

 Area 3
 ------

The "wall" will chase you from
behind. Make your way to the
right, and you will reach a
Checkpoint after a while. Now,
you will have to transport Kirby
through several gaps with spiked
in the floor and the ceiling.
After this, there is a fork. Go
with any of them. You will see a
small room with a Bomb Block on
the upper/lower part. Blow it up
and be QUICK to get in there an
collect the Medal. Continue
right until you have made your
way to the end.

 -------------------------------
   The World of Drawcia 8-1
   [KiW022]
 -------------------------------

 Area 1
 ------

Make your way to the right.
There are no enemies or
anything. You can find a 1UP in
the middle of the area, lying on
a platform in the upper part of
the room. when you get to the
final "stairs" before the exit,
go under them, and find a Medal
at the far right. Now use the
Area Exit.

 Area 2
 ------

Drawcia is trying to freak you
out with spooky music, you've
realized that, right? Good. Go
right, touch all the paintings
you meet, and go upwards between
all the spikes. In the final
room, a Medal will pop out of
nowhere once all the paintings
have been defeated. Now, enter
the Area Exit door.

 Drawcia Sorceress
 -----------------

Drawcia will first launch a
magic beam towards you. Draw a
Rainbow Line to reflect it. Now
dash into her three times while
she's stunned. If she tries to
ground pound down on you, dash
to avoid her, she will do one
ground pound at each side of the
screen. After a while, the
background will change, and a
painting will appear.

If there's and enemy on the
portrait, stun the enemies that
appear, and dash into them to
take them out. Several types of
enemies might appear.

If a Needle appears, draw a
Rainbow Line and go to the top
of the room to avoid taking
damage.

If a bomb appears, tap all the
bombs that drop down from the
air before they get close to
you.

If Drawcia suddenly flies fast
upwards, roll to the edge of the
screen that she was NOT placed
in when the went off-screen.

Drawcia might also suddenly
shoot enemies towards you. If
she does this, protect Kirby
using Rainbow Lines, or touch
the enemies.

Drawcia will be destroyed when
you've reflected enough magic
beams, but the battle goes on!
Now you have to fight Drawcia's
Soul! Your Health Point will
fill up before the next battle,
so don't fear death. Yet.

 Drawcia Soul
 ------------

Stand in the left corner. Just
watch Drawcia's Soul that's far
away in the background. She will
launch enemies at you. When
their eyes are opened, tap them
in the order they appeared in,
to send them back at the Soul of
Drawcia. If you miss, they will
attack you. Dash to avoid the
attacks of the flame and ice
ones, and draw a Line to block
the laserbeam ones.

If the soul starts moving
towards you, and away from the
background, you will have to
watch, and predict where the
soul lands. Dash to avoid it.

If the soul appears flying in
the middle of the area, touch
the yellow eye three times to
make it go away.

If the soul appears in the
middle of the area, but doesn't
move, it will launch some
spinning circles. Touch the ones
that are closes to Kirby so that
they don't hit him.

When the soul starts producing
lots of colors, go to the middle
of the area. Several beams will
attack from above and the sides.
Use Rainbow Lines to stop the
beams. A good technique is to
first draw a protective line
around Kirby, and then draw
another one at the outside.

If the background changes, and
you hear a Wheel sound, draw
Rainbow Lines to transport Kirby
to the upper part of the screen,
as the soul will charge into the
area where you are, and you will
only be able to avoid it by
sticking to the upper part of
the area.

As the battle continues, each
part gets harder. More enemies
appear, beams come faster at you
and the soul will bounce towards
you several times at once and so
on. Drawcia will go down after a
while, just don't die before
her!

  +-----------------------------
  + Boss Battles and Mini Games
    [KiWbos]+
  +-----------------------------

Unlike most other platformers,
Kirby: Canvas Curse gives you
the choice of three bosses when
you've done with a Level. You
will have to play against each
boss two times. Once you've done
this, you will unlock the boss
in the Subgames menu. There's
three difficulty settings to
choose from when you've unlocked
the bosses. Depending on how
well you do while battling,
racing or drawing, you will get
different ranks. The lowest one
is 'J', and the highest one is
'AAA'. If you get ranked 'A' or
higher in any of the games
below, you will earn a Medal. In
all, there are three medals to
unlock - one for each game.
Dash! Jump! can be unlocked by
playing and getting a score in
the Mini Game using all the
characters.

----

          DASH! JUMP!

At the end of each stage, there
is a Mini Game where you must
fly as far as you can through
the air. You will be rewarded
with stars. More stars if you
fly longer. When playing as
Kirby, tap him lots of times at
the start, and then use about
half of your ink to launch him
into the air. When he starts
loosing air, use the last half
of your ink to send him flying
again. Keep touching Kirby all
the time while he is flying mid
air as well! You can unlock a
medal by gaining 1500 points
while playing as Kirby. You will
be able to unlock this Mini Game
when you have played it with all
the characters in the game. When
you have done this, you can
choose it from the Sub Game
section.

----

          BLOCK ATTACK

In Block Attack, you start at a
the lowest level, and will have
to make your way upwards. You
can use the stylus to draw a
bumper-like bar that you can hit
Kirby with to make him bounce
off to the location of your
choice. The bar will start where
you start drawing with your
stylus, and end where you end
drawing. It is not dangerous to
touch non-stunned enemies in
this Mini Game. There are lots
of blocks. Touch them to weaken
them. When they have been
weakened enough, you can bounce
into them in order to take them
out. Watch out for spikes,
sparks and the like.

Defeat all enemies in a room to
continue. Remember that this
game is timed, and that you can
earn more time by entering the
next room. You get points by
destroying weakened blocks,
defeating enemies, tapping
blocks and collecting stars. You
can also touch Blocks with icons
on to make them go away. The
bosses are Kracko and Kracko
Junior. Defeat Kracko by
bouncing off his cloud that is
around him, and then bouncing
into his eye. Defeat Kracko
Junior by bouncing into him
between his armour. A is not the
highest ranking - AAA is. To get
the A rank and a medal, score
43,000 points.

---

            CART RUN

This is a race where you need to
outrun King DeDeDe. To do this,
place your stylus on the blue
"pad" in front of your cart, and
use it to control Kirby's cart.
Try not running into enemies, as
this will slow you down. If an
enemy gets too close, touch him
with your stylus to take him
out. The most important thing in
Cart Run is to run into food
items, as this will speed you
up. Run into two or more foods
at once, and you will get a Max
Speed boost. Try taking as much
food as you can all the time. As
you'll go faster, and get more
points. There are also Star
Blocks in Cart Run, but avoid
them, as they slow you down. You
can also pick up Energy Drinks
too get more Health Points, as
you will need this if you are
hit by enemies. Getting Rank A
on Level 3 is pretty hard, and
requires you to pick up food all
the time. Just keep on trying
until you've done it - 46,000
points is what you will need for
an A rank. Note that A is not
the top rank, as it is also
possible to be rated AAA.

---
          PAINT PANIC

Just like the popular children's
game in magazines, you will draw
lines from point to point in
Paint Panic. You start out with
four Health Points. If you miss
a point, the enemies will get
closer to you, and if you're too
slow, they will also get to you.
At the end, you will reach a
room where you have to touch
some marked bocks as fast as
possible, before they disappear.
If you draw accurate paintings,
and finish with a good time, you
will get bonus points. Note that
drawing accurate can be pretty
hard on a touch-screen, so make
sure your Nintendo DS is lying
on a flat and hard table or
floor. If you realize that you
will miss a point horribly, move
back to the previous one, and
try again. You need 36,000
points for the Medal and rank A.
This can be achieved by drawing
lines at normal speed, not too
fast, as you will miss your
targets more easily. Just as in
the other Subgames, it is
possible to get an AAA rating.

  +-----------------------------
  + Character Profiles [KiChar]
    +
  +-----------------------------

Kirby is not the only character
in this game. There are several
playable ones. Here's how to
unlock them, and more
information:

 Kirby
 -------
 Kirby is the hero of the game.
 His normal form is a tiny pink
 Ghost, but in Canvas Curse, he
 has been cursed by a witch.
 Now, Kirby is looking like a
 ball. He rolls through the
 various stages with help from
 Rainbow Lines. Kirby is the
 only playable character that
 can steal abilities. He does
 this by running into stunned
 enemies. Kirby can also dash
 forward if you touch him when
 he hasn't got any other ability
 Kirby has 4 Health Points at
 the start of the game, but you
 can unlock more of them in the
 Medal Swap section.

 Waddle Dee
 ----------
 Waddle Dee is also a ball like
 Kirby. He is unlocked by
 beating Drawcia Soul in the
 Main Game using Kirby. Waddle
 Dee is more bouncy and lighter
 than Kirby, and is able to
 dash. He is a slow one, so he
 doesn't compete with Kirby when
 it comes to fast movement.
 Waddle Dee has four Health
 Points.

 King DeDeDe
 -----------
 Once you've beat Drawcia using
 Waddle Dee, you can unlock King
 DeDeDe in the Medal Swap
 section of the game. King
 DeDeDe was originally an evil
 creature, but this time around,
 he has teamed up with Kirby.
 Maybe he's planning something
 for the next game in the
 series? Who knows? Anyways, the
 King sinks when he gets into
 water. If you touch him, he
 will use his hammer, which is
 useful for breaking certain
 blocks, Wodden Pieces and
 taking down enemies. King
 DeDeDe has seven Health Points,
 and costs 20 Medals to unlock.
 You need to have unlocked
 Waddle Dee to unlock the King.

 Meta Knight
 -----------
 This character is a little
 energy bomb. He is very bouncy,
 very fast, but has only three
 Health Points. Meta Knight uses
 an insisible sword to take down
 enemis. You can hear a sound of
 him using it when he rolls into
 an enemy. He can be unlocked in
 Medal Swap for 25 Medals, once
 you've unlocked King DeDeDe.
 Meta Knight floats in water,
 just like Kirby. You need to
 have King DeDeDe unlocked in
 order to unlock Meta Knight.

 Waddle Doo
 ----------
 Waddle Doo is unlocked after
 you've beat Drawcia using all
 of the other playable
 characters. He has a Beam
 Ability by default, and has
 five Health Points. Floats in
 water, and is not very fast. An
 alternate way to unlock Waddle
 Doo, is to beat Drawcia while
 the GBA cartridges "Nightmare
 in Dreamland" or "Kirby and the
 Amazing Mirror" is inserted in
 your GBA slot. Next time you
 load a file, Waddle Doo will be
 unlocked.

  + Rainbow Run Medals [KiReda]
    +
  +-----------------------------

Rainbow Run is a mode where you
can play the stages that you
have completed in the Main Game.
You can choose to play each
stage in either Time Trail mode,
or Line Trial mode. The thing
with these modes is that if you
get a good enough high-score,
you get a medal. In Time Trial,
try completing the stages as
fast as possible, and in Line
Trial, try using as little Ink
as possible. However, you do not
play the whole stages, just one
of the areas found in the Main
Game stage. If you beat the
highest score, you get three
medals, if you beat the middle
score you get two medals, and
you get one medal for the lowest
score that has been set by the
game.

Below, hints and tips for each
and every stage is provided,
both for Time Trial and Line
Trial. If you follow the hints
and tips, you should be able to
get three medals in all of the
stages. Good luck!

Just dash forward until the

Seconds]

a Wind Cannon. Use some Ink to
get out of it, and drop down to
the right and steal the Burning
Ability. Use it to dash over two
gaps, and then use some more Ink
to get upwards into the room
with all the cannons. After this
room, just dash using the
Flaming Ability while being mid-
air to get all the way to the
Exit.

gap, as a bubble will save you
from falling down. Blow up the
Star Blocks and Bomb Blocks
above you while floating
upwards, and then go right. Draw
a Line to roll over, yes over,
the No Paint Zone. Keep dashing

get to the end of the road, draw
Lines pointing upwards to the
left to get to the exit.


Rift Ruin Time Trial [Beat 27
Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

The most important thing here,
is to don't waste time on
stopping the Spiked Winders, and
to draw sharp turning Lines at
the start, as that you almost
instantly get to the floor
above, with just one Line. When
you get to the Wind Cannons,
blast upwards just before the
flames above disappear. After
the final Wind Cannon, there is
a usual cannon to your left. Get
into it, draw a Line that will
take Kirby directly to the exit
at the top left, so that you
will blast into this line.


Rift Ruin Line Trial [You need
more than 550ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Dash to the right. Don't bother
drawing Lines to get over the
two fist balls you meet, and
taking damage is ok. Get through
the port, and draw a line to get
into the cannon on the other
side of the gap. Dash below the
giant ball, and wait for it to
roll past, and draw a line to
get up, and continue left.
Repeat this once, and draw small
lines to roll over the pool. Get
into the cannon, blast upwards
and touch the lowest Star Block
and draw a Line to get though.

jumping enemies. You will get to

right, and draw a line into the
box behind the second enemy from
the bottom.


Contrast Cave Time Trial [Beat
37 Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

This one is very easy. Touch the
stream of big star Blocks that
are gathered to the left. Once
you've broken a few, tap Kirby
once and make him fall into the
hole. Continue tapping the
blocks and dashing with Kirby.
When you get the Beam Ability,
discard of it, as dashing like
usual is much more effective.

At the far left, you will get
the Stone Ability. Keep it and
drop into the No Paint Zone.
Roll into the first gap
(remember to destroy the block
here), and then use the Stone
Ability to break all the blocks
below you to get to the exit.


Contrast Cave Line Trial [You
need more than 300ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Take out the Star Blocks to the
left and drop down. Dash into
the air above the cannons, and
draw a small line to make it to
the other side. Just run into
the spikes - loosing some Health
isn't bad for you in Line Trial.
When you get to a fork with an
upper and a lower path, get into
the cannon and choose the upper
one. Here, steal the Burning
Ability. One you've got it, you
won't have to use more Ink at
all. Just dash right with the
Burning Ability after you've
dropped down. Through the
Winders, and wait for the Evil
Blocks to drop down. Then Burn
all the way left, over the gap,
past a few enemies, and get to
the exit at the far bottom left.

and draw a Line to get up of the
water. Press the button here to
open the port. Continue left, go
through two ports and let the
crane take you over the electric
floor. Drop down, dash right and
press the Bomb Block that is
mounted into some Blocks that
are preventing some enemies to
get down. Dash to the left, into
some water, and dash to the
surface on the far left. Touch
the Bomb Block there, drop down,
and draw Lines to get over the
green poles at the start of each
gap. Ignore the two small
cannons, and draw a line into
the bigger one at the top. Shoot
yourself to the right, and exit.

a Line to get up the small hill
to the left, and dash left over
a button, through a port and
touch the Bomb Block at the far
left to get further left. Drop
down, dash right past three
Spiked Winders underwater. Dash
into a button and through a port
at the far right, and drop down.
Dash into buttons to open ports
- if you are too high up to
reach a button, just dash into a
wall to bounce downwards. At the
far left, drop down and continue
dashing until you see a Stone in
the ceiling above a gap. Draw
extremely small lines to get
over the gap - and several other
ones right after it. You can't
just dash, as there is a current
here. At the end of the gaps,
there is a green pole. Wait
there until an Evil Block has
dropped down. Now, you can exit
the area to your right.

laserbeams. The Exit is waiting
for you.

the far left side, shoot into
another cannon, and you will
eventually end up in a third
cannon after having bounced
around a little. Shoot to the

the wall. Now you can roll into
the Exit Door.

50 Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Dash right, touch the lights to
get rid of the darkness. Watch
out for the spikes, and draw
nice Lines that give Kirby more
speed. Remember to dash all the
time, even while rolling on
Lines. You will eventually get
to a Green Pole. From there, go
upwards, then drop down in the
next room with the spikes on the
wall. In the next room go up,
and in the one after that down.
After a while you will get to a
room with some Cannons. At the
top, you can exit the area.


Dreamy Darkness Line Trial [You
need more then 300ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Draw a small line to get up to
the Needle type enemy. Steal its
ability. You see, when you are a
Needle, Kirby will fly much
higher after he has gotten onto
a Line pointing upwards, or any
other direction. Just draw short
Lines and get onto them while
being a Needle, until you reach
the exit at the top. You
absolutey need to be a Needle to
make it with more than 300ml
left.


Paletto Polis Time Trial [Beat
45 Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Dash left, and use Lines to get
to the top. Ignore the Sticky
Pad. Continue using lines to
roll through the spiked areas,
as well at the flat ones. When
you reach the two cannons, draw
a Line between the two of them
and roll through.Again, ignore
the Pad, and draw Lines between
all the cannons. Try avoid being
hit, even though it's hard. At
the top, go far left to exit the
area.


Paletto Polis Line Trial [You
need more than 1450ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Prepare for the most tricky Line
Trial so far!

Touch the Bomb Block, drop into
the pipe at the bottom, and wait
for the spikes to appear. Now,
quickly dash all the way over
the area with the spikes, and
enter the pipe at the other
side. Dash to the right, and
draw a Line to take you upwards
past the spiked wall. Enter the
pipe on the left, and drop down
while touching Bomb Blocks. Dash
instead of using lines to avoid
the spears. At the bottom there
is a cannon. Enter it and get
shot onto a Sticky Pad. Jump
right until you get to the
moving Sticky Pad. Once on it,
wait until it reaches the far
right, and jump off into a No
Paint Zone. Make all the buttons
turn red, and dash right, draw a
Line, and get into the pipe in
the ceiling above you. Now for a
tricky part; draw short Lines
upwards, as you will need to get
to the top of this room with all
the Glass Blocks in. Dash like
crazy to gain air. You will need
to draw quite a few, but short,
Lines.

At the top, touch the Bomb Block
at the right wall, and roll left
after the explotion. Dash left,
and draw a small line to get
over the gap and onto the other
side. Press the button here, and
drop down. Dash left, run over a
button, and use a Line to get up
again to the room you were in
earlier. Get into the pipe
again, but this time, draw Lines
upwards, and touch the Bomb
Block you get to in order to
make a cannon fall down. Enter
it and shoot upwards through
some Black Blocks. Dash right
through some No Paint Zones. At
the far right, make all the
buttons turn blue. Drop down and
you will get to another room
with Glass Blocks in. Make sure
to watch closely, as there is a
button in this room one some
Glass Bocks. Dash to reach and
press the button. Drop all the
way down, and draw another small
line to get over the gap, and
onto the HIGHER ground on the
other side. Here, be quick and
turn all the buttons yellow.
Drop down, draw a line that can
take Kirby down and then left,
and exit the area. Phew.


Cold Course Time Trial [Beat 90
Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Roll onto the button in front of
you, draw a line and roll onto
the second one above you and to
the right behind an enemy, and
draw another line left, and then
draw lines to take you all the
way to the upper left corner of
the screen to press a new
button. Now, you can drop a
little down, go to the right,
and press yet another button.
The next step is to go ALL the
way back to the start, up, and
then press a new button. Get up
to the upper left of the screen
again, and use the path that has
opened towards the right. Steal
the Ability from the snow type
enemy here, and drop a long,
long way down, using narrow
lines to avoid spikes. Keep to
the right, drop down past the
Star Blocks and onto a Sticky
Pad. Get rid of the Freeze
Ability, and use lines to
quickly go left, avoiding spikes
that are falling from above. At
the far left, the exit is
waiting for you.


Cold Course Line Trial [You need
more than 300ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Dash to the right and use the
cannon to shoot you upwards
after you've removed the Star
Blocks above. Dash right off the
Sticky Pad, touch the Blocks
that the cannons stand on, and
draw a small Line to get over
the gap. Make sure you quickly
touch the big Star Blocks at the
other side, and continue rolling
right until you meet a Wind
Cannon. Get in its stream of
wind, touch it to get upwards
and draw a line so that you can
enter the path to the right. If
you get the Wheel Ability, get
rid of it, and dash all the way
down the platforms and exit the
stage.


Cold Course Line Trial [You need
more than 350ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Dash down to the platform you
can see and steal the Stone
Ability. Use it to drop down
until you see some Bomb Blocks.
Break them all, get rid of the
Stone Ability, and dash to the
right past some spikes. If you
run into the spikes, it's not a
very big deal. Now just float
upwards, and touch stones that
might appear above you. At the
surface use a small Line to get
Kirby up on the ground. Dash
quickly right, through all the
enemies, and under the stones
that will fall down from the
ceiling, and drop into the water
on the far right. IF you get an
ability, get rid of it. Now,
dash downwards, touch the Spikes
Winders to stop them, and float
up after you've gotten a little
to the right. Stones will drop
down from above, so be on your
guard. Use a small Line to get
to the ground after having
reached the surface. Use Lines
to get to the top here, and drop
down in the water to your right.
Dash into all the buttons to
open the ports and exit the
stage at the bottom.


Dungeon Dome Time Trial [Beat
100 Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Steal the Spark Ability from the
enemy on your right, and draw a
line up to the right into the
fake white wall. Dash right, and
use the Ability to take down
enemies. Use lines to go higher
and change direction when you
need to. When you get to all the
Star Blocks above you, use the
Spark Ability to remove the ones
placed closest to the right, and
draw Lines to go upwards. You
will meet more Star Blocks, so
use the Spark Ability. Get up
into a new fake wall, and head
right. Get rid of your Spark
Ability. At the end, you will
have to get up to another floor.
Keep as much to the left as you
can when you roll up using the
Line, as there is a green enemy
that will come out of the right
wall and try to eat you. If you
run into any Abilities, get rid
of them. Dash all the way left,
and drop down through a pipe.
While falling down, touch all
the enemies that appear under
Kirby.

When you reach the bottom, do
not dash, but touch the Bomb
Block that is located above you,
but below some enemies, now,
nicely roll into the gap that
opened on the floor. Drop all
the way down, and use Rainbow
Lines to get to the far right.
Then use Lines to get upwards
until you reach the exit.
However, you should stay as far
away from the walls as you can
(stay in the middle), as there
are monsters scattered around
trying to eat you.


Dungeon Dome Line Trial [You
need more than 350ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Steal the Stone Ability that can
be found on the platform belove,
drop down into the water using
it, and make your way past the
spiked floor. Get rid of the
Stony Ability and get to the
surface. Use a Line to gt up on
the ground, and then dash right
and down into some water. Dash
downwards, touch the Spiked
Winders to stop them and float
all the way to the top. Use a
line to get onto the ground
above you, and then two small
ones to get up the big hill
you'll meet. Now dash right, and
get to the exit on the bottom of
the water.


Canvas Canyon Time Trial [Beat
34 Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Start by drawing a line that can
get you to the top of the
platforms and dash all the way
up. Touch the Bomb Block, and
dash into the air. Note that you
should go below the loose green
ground that blocks the top of
the screen. The rest is very
easy. Just dash right all the
time while drawing long and flat
Lines under Kirby. With some
luck, you will avoid all enemies
and bombs falling down from
above. I recommend drawing the
lines pretty far up, and not at
the bottom of the screen.
Beating this stage using less
than thirty seconds is fairly
simple.


Canvas Canyon Line Trial [You
need more than 550ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Draw three small Lines; each to
get to one platform higher up.
At the top, touch the Bomb
Block, and fall down to the
right. When you see the lowest
ground, dash once to reach it.
Use a small line to get into the
cannon on your right, shoot out,
and use another line to enter
another cannon. You will now
shoot into yet another one. You
will stop at a green pole. From
here, dash left, and then draw a
line to get onto the platform
below you. Blow up the Bomb
Block, get into the cannon, let
it shoot you out, and then dash
once to fall into another
cannon. Shoot into the next
cannon, dash when you're as far
up as the blast can take you to
fall into another one, and
repeat this until you reach the
last cannon. From here, draw
small lines and dash to the
exit.


Collapse Castle Time Trial [Beat
75 Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Activate the light, then dash
right. Draw a Line to get over
the electric floor, and then
roll over a button at the far
left. Do not hit the spikes on
the wall, and dash back through
a port. Drop down, activate
another light, and dash right.
You should drop down, and draw a
line pointing down and to the
right, in order to avoid being
catch ed by the Wind Cannons. It
doesn't matter if you hit an
enemy, just get to the bottom
and dash left to fall into
another gap. Down here, activate
another light, stop at the green
pole and touch the Spiked Winder
to stop it. Now roll over the
gap using a Line. Repeat this
one, and just ignore the
cannons. When you've rolled over
the gap with the second Spiked
Winder, you will get to another
one. Stop it so that it points
upwards 90 degrees. Drop down,
stop another Winder, and make a
Line so that you can roll
through the air and into the
path on the left side. Here,
there's a button at the far
left, but you will need to draw
a very flat line and roll on it
to activate the button that's
placed behind some laserbeams.
Now roll back and drop down the
gap you've opened up. Keep on
drawing Lines and dashing over
the electric floors you meet,
and reach the exit at the bottom
left. This level might take some
tries, I know I used a few.


Collapse Castle Line Trial [You
need more than 650ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Dash right, touch the Ice Block
to make it float upwards, and go
through the pipe. You will get
to some Ice Blocks above you
that are preventing you from
getting through a pipe. First,
touch the rightmost one, and
then the third one from the
left. Draw a very small line,
and use it to dash through the
opening that you've made. Now,
some of the Blocks will have
trapped an enemy between them.
First touch the Ice Block that's
closes to the ceiling, then the
one closest to the bottom, so
that it falls a little down.
Now, touch the leftmost one to
make it float towards you. Draw
a small line to get over it, and
touch the bottom block to make
it float upwards when the enemy
is not circling directly above
it. It doesn't matter if the
enemy damages you. Now, with all
blocks out of the way, drop down
through a pipe.

Now, dash left, and smiley touch
all the Ice Blocks to make them
stop the laserbeams. Roll
through the No Paint Zone, and
through another pipe. You will
get to another laserbeam, but
this time there's no blocks to
protect you. Don't waste Ink,
just dash through it. You will
loose a Health Point, but you're
fine with that, right? Ignore
the first Ice Block that's
located to the left of some
spikes. Draw small lines to get
to the other side of the spikes,
and touch the Ice Block at the
right side, so that you can
easily fall down the gap. Now,
ignore the next Ice Block, and
draw small Lines to go to the
other side of the spikes. Roll
over the green and purple
buttons to open two ports. In
the next room, draw a Line to
get up to the leftmost
laserbeam. There's a button in
the middle of the beam, so draw
a Line above Kirby to protect
him from laser until he's rolled
over the button. Repeat this
step with the rightmost
laserbeam. Now, drop down to the
main floor, use a Line to block
the laserbeam that has appeared
in the middle of the room, and
press the button. Roll through
the pipe to the left. You will
get to a No Paint Zone. Just
dash to the right all the time,
over buttons and gaps. At the
end, there is a gap that you
will have to draw a small Line
to get over. Now, exit the
Stage.


Volatile Volcano Time Trial
[Beat 32 Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Dash right to bounce over a lava
pit. On the top of the hill
after this pit, draw a line to
stop Kirby for a second or two,
and let the lava rise, and then
fall. Continue Dashing right.
You will get to a red pole. From
this point of the Stage, the
lava won't rise high enough to
hurt you, so just dash to the
right all the time. This is all
you have to do until you get to
the flames that are shooting
upwards. Draw lines above the
flames, and make Kirby roll on
the Lines while dashing. You
will reach a button, but you
don't need to activate it. Just
continue dashing and drawing
lines until you are at the exit
on the far right. A very easy
trial, don't you think?


Volatile Volcano Line Trial [You
need more than 400ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

At the start, dash right past an
enemy. Draw a small line to get
over the gap. Dash while being
mid air, as you can fly over two
gaps using just one Line. Repeat
this. It's important that you
dash while being mid air, so
that you won't get hurt by
enemies. At the far right, drop
down and dash left past the
green pole. Dash left past three
Flame Winders. Draw small lines
to get over the lava. At the end
of the lava, after you've passed
a platform with a Green Pole,
there's a port of lava rising up
and falling down. If it hits
you, just try once more. Drop
down at the far left, avoid the
Flame Winder, and use small
Lines to get over the lava, and
right. You will get to a place
where you will need to use very
small lines to bounce to the
other side, as there's no ground
there. A crane will pick you up.
Let it take you right. The third
flame that it shooting upwards
might hit you, but this doesn't
really matter. You can of course
avoid it if you want to. Well,
now you're at the exit.


Silent Seabed Time Trial [Beat
77 Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Touch the Bomb Block to your
left, steal the Stone Ability,
and drop down through the Star
Blocks. Use Lines to keep Kirby
to the right, and drop down to
the Ice Blocks, Touch one to
fall down, draw a Line to roll
left, and touch one of the new
Ice Blocks to fall further down.
Fall downwards, and keep Kirby
to either the left or the right
side, but try not falling while
being placed ALL the way into
the wall, as there are blocks
there, that might be stopped by
enemies when you try to move
them. And thus, it's best to
stay away from the blocks. Well,
you will get to lots of Star
Blocks, but you can easily fall
through them since you're stone.
You will now get to a button.
Use lines to roll into it, and
some blocks will blow up. Fall
down through a pipe at the
bottom. Get rid of the Stone
Ability, dash right and steal
the Spark Ability. Get up the
pipe at the far right, and use
the Spark Ability to blow up the
Star Blocks while floating
upwards. It's important that you
use narrow lines to lead Kirby
upwards right after you've used
sparks, as he'll also dash to
one of the sides, but you want
to go straight up. After a while
you will meet some enemies. Just
keep floating upwards. The exit
is at the top, and you can make
it there in time even if you're
hit by enemies.


Silent Seabed Line Trial [You
need more than 500ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Dash left past two speedpads,
and you will get to a Spiked
Winder. Follow the stream down
and left until you see the path
at the top. Draw a small line to
get up there, and dash left to
activate a button. Dash right,
under an electric ceiling, and
onto a speedpad. At the far
right, float upwards past some
Stone Blocks, and use a Line to
get up to where a button is.
Activate it, and dash down and
to the left. Touch the Bomb
Block to get through. Dash
downwards, pass the laserbeam
without protecting Kirby, as
damage is fine, and get to
another Spiked Winder. Get to
the path on the left, and
activate a button to blow up the
ceiling. Touch the enemies that
fall down, and then float
upwards. After passing some
electric walls, use a line to
get onto the ground above you
and dash right. Choose the lower
path, follow the stream of the
Spiked Winder, and touch the
wall with a '!' on to break it
and get through. Dash all the
way to the bottom, activate a
button, float up again, and dash
to the far right to exit the
stage.


Frozen Fantasy Time Trial [Beat
90 Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

This one is pretty hard. At all
times, dash like crazy. Never
rest! Touch the rightmost
breakable wall below you. Use a
line to get down there and roll
over the button. Roll out on the
other side after breaking the
wall, and then draw a Line to
get all the way to the top.
Break a new wall, draw a Line,
press the green button, and drop
further down. Once in the water,
dash down, and then left. Break
a wall, break the ground, and
press the button that's placed
under the breakable ground.
Break another wall to the left,
and get into the next room.
Follow the current a little, and
draw a Line to get upwards.
There's a button on the left,
and a spiked enemy is guarding
it. Roll over the button to
activate it, and use Lines to
get upwards again. You will see
the Exit, but it has been
blocked. Ignore the two nearby
buttons and draw Lines to go
upwards. Break the wall, and
then go right past a green pole.
Let the Evil Block drop down,
and draw Rainbow Lines to roll
over it, and to the right. Press
the button placed on a platform,
and drop down. Take the right
fork, stop the Spiked Winders
and activate the purple button
at the far right. Now, dash ALL
the way left until you reach the
room with the Exit Door. Here,
exit the stage.

need more than 3000ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Another hard one! Dash! Activate
the button to your right, use
small Lines to go higher up, and
activate a new button further
right. Now, use lines to go to
the upper left part of the room.
There's a spiked floor/ceiling
here, so dash past when the
spikes have just disappeared. At
the other side, you will need to
use some Ink to avoid the
speedpad that's trying to send
you back. Press the button near
the speedpad to blow up the
wall, and then use a small Line
to press a new button further
right. Use more Ink to go
upwards, and take the right
fork. Here, you need to use
extremely small Lines to get
past all the spikes, travel one
floor up, and then press a
button. Remember to dash while
flying mid air. Go back to the
fork, and head upwards. Use as
little Ink as possible while
passing all the spiders. At the
top, pass two speedpads, and
dash right when you get to all
the falling stones. There's a
button at the far right. Once
activated, you can head left
again, use some Ink to get up to
the Exit Door, and leave.


Mad Mechanism Time Trial [Beat
60 Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Dash right into the No Paint
Zone, avoid the spiked enemies
by waiting a little, and fall
down at the far right. Let the
crane pick you up, fall down at
the second gap. Dash further,
but remember touching the
enemies many times each in order
to blow them up. At the next
crane, drop down at the third
gap. You will get to an area
with four walls that need to be
broken. Two bombs will spawn
again and again. Draw Lines to
roll Kirby towards one of the
walls, and take a bomb with you
on the way. This room is really
what takes most skill in this
level. Once all four walls are
broken and all four buttons are
pressed, drop down and exit the
stage.


Mad Mechanism Line Trial [You
need more than 1300ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Dash right, use a Line or two to
get to the flat floor at the
top, and then dash right.
There's three laserbeams here.
Roll through them, don't use any
Ink at all. You will now drop
down to a Sticky Pad. Ride it,
defend Kirby from laserbeams
using Ink and jump down in a gap
at the end. Before you land at
the Sticky Pad below, draw a
small Line that will make Kirby
bounce left. Get to the floor,
and dash onto the Sticky Pad to
your left. Protect Kirby from
beams using Ink, and get to the
far left. Use the bumper to gain
a little air, and use small
lines and some dashing to do the
rest. Get onto the Sticky Pad,
and jump between some electric
blocks, and draw one last line
to get to the exit.


Spectacle Space Time Trial [Beat
85 Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Steal the nearby Missile
Ability, use it to fly to the
upper right corner of the
room/space and press the button
there, Now, fly towards where
you started, but pass the ground
and go left, then down and press
another button. Now, fly back
again to the start using
whichever way you want to use as
long as you don't crash, and
make all the buttons around the
Exit Door turn red by touching
them. Congratulations, you've
cleared the final stage, if we
look away from the special ones
in the sections below.


Spectacle Space Line Trial [You
need more than 1600ml left]
--------------------------------
Character of Choice: Kirby

Ok, here we go. Dash right, draw
a small Line so that you can
dash and fly into the spiked
area. Use extremely small lines,
and dash while rolling on them,
to get to the second Balloon.
Ignore the first one. The second
Balloon is located right after
you've gone right at the first
fork. Steal the Balloon Ability,
use it to get to the top right,
and then get rid of it. Use
small lines to go left past some
spiked enemies, then up when you
get to the Green Pole, and then
left. Since the spikes go
downwards after you've turned
left, you can just dash while
floating mid air here. Go up
again when you need to, and draw
lines, or drop down to the
spikes and dash while loosing
Health if you want to, to get to
the far right, and the exit.


Stone A Time Trial [Beat 55
Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

Fall onto the Speedpad, take
down an enemy, and then use the
Stone Ability to roll down to
some Bomb Blocks. Touch them all
as you fall. Once you've taken
out the last Bomb Block, draw a
line to get to the upper path,
deactivate the Stone Ability and
roll onto another speedpad. When
you reach the air, use the Stone
Ability again to fall all the
way down. Hurry up and get into
the first cannon after you've
deactivated the Stone Ability
again. Shoot all the way right
and use the bumper to gain air.
Draw Lines to get to another
bumper above you. Repeat this
until you are at the top. Pass
the Green Pole and then roll
down the hill while being stone.
Keep to the left, and you will
fall onto some Stone Blocks.
Touch the Bomb Block here, and
fall down, still keeping to the
left and being stone, to break
lots of yellow Star Blocks.
Deactivate the Stone Ability
again, draw a Line to make Kirby
quickly roll onto the path i the
middle, as there's one without
any ground to roll on, one with
a Speedpad, and one with a
crane. You will want to go with
the Speedpad in the middle. Now,
you are at the exit.


Stone A Line Trial [You need
more than 350ml left]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

This one is so easy, your
grandma's cow can do it. Well,
use the Speedpad to roll right,
and stun the enemies, then roll
past them. Touch the Bomb
Blocks, drop all the way down,
touch the Star Blocks, and roll
left down to the cannons. When
rolling below the second cannons
from the left, use the Stone
Ability, to make Kirby jump into
the cannon. Shoot all the way to
the right, deactivate the
ability, and use the bumper to
gain air. Draw extremely small
Lines to bounce Kirby up to the
next bumper. Repeat until you
are at the top near the Green
Pole. Roll down the hill as a
stone, and keep to the left once
you've made it further down. Use
the Stone Ability to break the
Star Blocks, and use a very
small Line to get Kirby up to
the speedpad, and then dash left
to exit the Stage.


Wheel A Time Trial [Beat 36
Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

Use the Wheel Ability to dash
all the way to the far right,
passing seven sets of Wheel
Blocks. Once you see the end of
the road, draw a nice
backwards-C formed Line that
will bounce Kirby to the left.
Once Kirby faces left, activate
the Wheel Ability again. Once
you've rolled through five Star
Blocks, you will get to a place
where you'll crash if you don't
draw a nice flat Line for Kirby
to roll on, so do that. You will
eventually get to a cannon. Just
drop into it, activate the Wheel
Ability once you're out again,
and roll into a new cannon.
Shoot upwards, draw a Line for
Kirby to land on, and activate
the Wheel Ability to roll left.
Now, draw a Line to transport
Kirby between the laserbeams.
Once Kirby crashes into the left
wall, use the Wheel Ability to
roll right, draw a Line over the
gap, and exit stage.


Wheel A Line Trial [You need
more than 400ml left]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

Another very easy stage. Well,
roll all the way right using
your Wheel Ability. Then use it
to roll left. Use a little Ink
to get over the small hindrance,
and roll into the first, then
into the second cannon. Use some
Ink again to make it to the
ground to the left of the second
cannon, and roll left. Don't
mind the laserbeams, as some
damage won't stop you. At the
end of the stage, use a little
Ink to get Kirby over the gap
while he's rolling using the
Wheel Ability.


Missile A Time Trial [Beat 68
Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

What can I say.. Just use the
Missile Ability from start.
Guide Kirby through the only
path he can take using Lines,
and don't crash. If you avoid
crashing, which is very easy,
you'll get three medals.. The
easiest Time Trial in the game.


Missile A Line Trial [You need
more than 600ml left]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

This one is easy. Just keep
doing the same as in Missile A
Time Trial, but use very, very
small lines to control the
Missile Kirby is flying around
as. If you crash, look around
you; if there's any chance to
roll instead of flying around,
do that. You shouldn't need to
if you use small enough lines
however. The first time I got
three medals, I had 988ml left
if you want to know.


Balloon A Time Trial [Beat 50
Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

Touch Kirby to make him fly
upwards. Do so until he blows.
Now while being in the usual
form, draw a line to go right or
left. Touch Kirby to make him
fly higher again, and repeat
until you get to a room where
you need to go through a passage
at the top center of the room.
Transport Kirby to the center,
and use the Balloon Ability to
go all the way up here, just
like earlier. At the top, use
lines to direct Kirby through a
new passage to the right, and
then in the next room, center.
You will reach two cannons. Go
back to normal form, draw a Line
to get Kirby to the far left,
and then go up, and exit.


Balloon A Line Trial [You need
more than 900ml left]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

Very easy one. Just use the
Balloon Ability to bounce around
until you are at the exit. Since
you have unlimited with time,
this shouldn't be hard. I've
done the stage without even
using Ink at all lots of times.
If you get frustrated, a little
Ink doesn't hurt though.


Stone B Time Trial [Beat 87
Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

Start by drawing a Line to the
right, activate the Stone
Ability and fall down past all
the spiked enemies. Once landed,
touch the Bomb Block below you
to fall further down. Right
before you land, draw a small
Line to the left so that Kirby
lands on a button. Now, draw a
Line to take Kirby right.
Deactivate the Stone Ability to
float right past some spikes
using a line as a protective
ceiling, then float up, roll
past more spikes, and activate
the Stone Ability again to fall
down past some spiked enemies.
Repeat this until you reach a
downhill with a Spiked Winder at
the end. Activate the Stone
Ability and roll down the hill.
Stop the Winder, then deactivate
Stone Ability to float up at the
far right. Get to the surface,
roll left, but avoid the Wind
Cannons, and instead draw lines
to take you upwards past the
spikes. Repeat this until you
find yourself at the top, having
passed all the Wind Cannons.
Enter the Huge Cannon up here
and shoot all the way left.
Activate the Stone Ability again
to roll all the way downhill,
and draw a line so that you can
pass the Speedpad at the bottom.
Theres a Wooden Piece that you
need to roll onto while being
stone. Drop down, roll left. You
will see several flames. Once
you're close to one, activate
the Stone Ability to get past.
At the far left, exit the stage.


Stone B Line Trial [You need
more than 2000ml left]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

Drop down using the Stone
Ability, touch the Bomb Block at
the bottom and fall further down
Touch Kirby to get yourself
bouncing into the wall on the
left, and bounce back over the
button, and further right to
fall down a gap. Now, touch
Kirby to transform into normal
shape, and float right. Touch
him again to use the Stone
Ability when you're at the top,
with a ceiling of spikes above
you. Repeat this until you get
to a downhill. Roll down, and
stop the Spiked Winder.
Transform back to standard
shape, and float up at the far
right. Sine avoiding the Winder
is pretty hard, it doesn't
matter if you take a little
damage. At the top, draw a line
to get up to the ground and roll
left past the bomb type enemy.
Get into the Wind Cannon, and
shoot upwards between the
spikes. Use Lines to continue.
Do this until you have passed
all the Wind Cannons. If you get
too close an exploding enemy,
just turn to stone. Well, after
all the Wind Cannons, use a
small line and dash up to the
bumper above you. Use a small
line after having gained some
air, and roll into the cannon
you get to see. Shoot all the
way left, roll down the hill as
stone, roll over the Wooden
Piece at the bottom and drop
down. Now roll left through the
No Paint Zone. When you meet a
flame type enemy, turn to stone,
and then turn back to roll
further. At the far left, exit
using a tiny line.


Wheel B Time Trial [Beat 45
Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

Use the Wheel Ability to roll
right. You will get to two gaps
with spikes below you. Use some
lines to get over the lava.
Afterwards, you will run into a
place with lava both in the
ceiling and the floor. Here,
draw a single, long line that's
pointing straight right, to make
Kirby roll into a cannon. Shoot
out, and use the Wheel Ability
to speed left. After having
passed ten or so Star Blocks,
crash into the wall on the far
left, and bounce to the right.
Do not enter the pipe down at
the floor, but draw a line to
that you can use the Wheel
Ability to roll onto the path
above the pipe. Roll further
right past some Wheel Blocks
until you crash into the wall on
the far right. Now, use the
Ability again to roll left, and
draw a couple of lines to get
over the gap. Repeat this, and
then draw a line to get upwards
at the far left. Now, just draw
a line to get further up at the
right side again, but don't use
the Wheel Ability before you're
at the top. Now, roll to the far
left and exit.


Wheel B Line Trial [You need
more than 800ml left]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

This one is very easy. At first,
get over the two gaps with
spikes in by rolling over them
using the Wheel Ability. Use
Very small lines. The place at
the far left with lava in the
ceiling and on the floor doesn't
have to be avoided; just roll
through the lava using the Wheel
Ability. When you get to the
pipe, use it instead of going
above it. When you get to the
huge gaps at the bottom of the
stage, do not use the Wheel
Ability, but instead draw small
lines to counce Kirby all the
way to the other side. When you
need to get to the top after
these two huge gaps, use small
lines, but do not use the Wheel
Ability. When you're at the top,
just roll all the way left, and
exit the stage.


Missile B Time Trial [Beat 53
Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

The important thing here is that
you never stop or crash, or turn
back to normal form when you
don't absolutely need to.
Well,Start flying using the
Missle Ability, and guide Kirby
using lines until you reach the
room with the first button.
Here, fly into the Star Block to
make the button drop down. Roll
over it as fast as you can. This
is the only place that you need
to crash. Well, continue flying
upwards through some Star Blocks
and Missile Blocks. Guide your
Missle right to fly through some
Bomb Blocks, then left, then
right again. The falling stones
are not dangerous while you're
flying. The rest is your usual
drill; protect Kirby for
laserbeams, and then run into
the button at the other side.
Continue flying, and run into
the buttons without stopping. At
the top, exit the stage.


Missile B Line Trial [You need
more than 500ml left]
--------------------------------

This stage might look so hard
you'll cry, but the truth is
that it's a very easy one. You
can afford to use Ink every
single time it is neccessary to
turn the Missile. Just do just
as you did in Missile B Time
Trial, but use very small lines.
It does not really make the
course harder, you just need to
concentrate on drawing exremely
small lines that your Missile
will fly into, and then turn.
I've done this course with 684ml
left without even trying to
break a record or anything like
that.


Balloon B Time Trial [Beat 55
Seconds]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

At the start, draw a line to go
left or right, and then activate
the Balloon Ability to make
kirby draw in air, and fly
higher. Do this until you've
reached the top of the room.
Here, deactivate the Ability,
and draw a Line to carefully
make Kirby roll up the passage
at the top of the room. Now, use
the Balloon Ability again, and
float upwards while touching the
Star Blocks to remove them. Once
you've passed all the Star
Blocks, deactivate the Balloon
Ability again, and touch the
Bomb Block at either the left or
the right side of the room. Draw
a Line to travel upwards, while
breaking Bomb Blocks. When you
feel comfortable, use the
Balloon Ability to float up to
the next room. Here, repeat what
you did in the previous room,
and continue upwards. In the
final room, use the Balloon
Ability to float straight up to
the exit.


Balloon B Line Trial [You need
more than 800ml left]
--------------------------------
Character: Kirby

A very easy stage, but hard to
write a guide for. Basically,
what you need to do is the same
as in Balloon A Line Trial. Just
Use the Balloon Ability to
bounce into a wall. Keep on
bouncing until you reach the
place you want to go to. If you
get too frustrated, use a little
Ink, but not much. Bouncing
alone can get you to the exit
without using any Ink at all.

  + Switch Locations [KiSwit] +
  +-----------------------------


When you are travelling in the
different Stages, you will
eventually meet colored floors
and walls. There are Medals
hidden on the other side of the
walls and floors. To get to the
other side, you will have to
find a switch with the same
color as the wall or floor that
you want to get to the other
side of. The switches are
located at very different
places. Read this section to
find all the switches!



 Orange Switch
 -------------

Iello Adventure, Rift Ruin is
where you'll find the Orange
Switch. In Area 2, go upwards
using the Wind Cannons until you
encounter an enemy with the
Stone Ability. Steal the
ability, and then enter the
Hidden Door to your right. Its
very close. Inside this room,
the Orange Switch is located
below some Stone Blocks that you
will have to break using the
Stone Ability.

 Green Switch
 -------------
Bloo Hills, Cold Course is where
this one is found. In Area 2,
below the first Wind Cannon you
will meet, there is a wall that
can be broken. Inside, the Green
Switch is located. The first
Windcannon is found by simply
rolling to the right from start,
then going up, then right.


 Blue Switch
 -----------
Wonder Lilane, Frozen Fantasy is
where this one is found. In Area
2, get onto the lower Sticky Pad
close to the start of the area.
Sit on it until the Pad starts
going right. Stop it once this
happens, and dash off to the
right. Kirby will follow a line
of stars, and then land on a new
Sticky Pad. Now, sit on this one
until you get to a door. Enter
this door. Inside, touch all the
Bomb Blocks you can see, but let
the closest one be the last
block you touch. Now, after
touching this closest Bomb
Block, the big ball above you
will start rolling. Now go right
as fast as you can, break the
remaining Bomb Blocks, and then
run over a button. If you were
fast enough, the ball will drop
down, and activate the Blue
Switch!
