[2] INTRODUCTION
================================

This guide was made to walk
those playing either the
American Pokemon Diamond or
Pearl through their adventure.
While Pokemon isn't a terribly
difficult kind of game to
understand, anyone can have
problems playing almost any
game, for whatever reason.

When you first start your new
game, you will be introduced to
the game's basics by a character
named Professor Rowan. He will
ask you some questions, and
within these questions you will
define your character's gender,
name, and your rival's name.
Thankfully you're given the
option to skip many rudimentary
lectures about the game you're
playing. If you're not familiar
with the game's controls, you
can always pick the option to
listen to the lecture concerning
them within the conversation
with the Professor. After all
that, your adventure begins.


================================
[3] WALKTHROUGH
================================
 1) Starting Your Adventure
--------------------------------

    =---------------------------
    =- a. Twinleaf Town -=
    =---------------------------

As soon as your adventure
begins, you will see a
television show about some group
that failed to catch sight of a
red Gyarados. After that, you
will find yourself in your room
of your house. Like previous
Pokemon games, you'll see
Nintendo's current-gen
television console hooked up to
your T.V. This time around,
Nintendo's Wii is their current-
gen television console, and one
is appropriately hooked up to
your television, which is a nice
touch.

Contrary to previous Pokemon
games, your PC does not contain
a Potion inside of it. In fact,
no longer does any PC anywhere
hold items. All items this time
around are always carried on
your person. This, however, is
not problematic, because you can
carry up to 999 (yes, that's
three digits) of all items in
the entire game with you at all
times.

Walk down the stairs, and your
mother will greet you. She
recommends that you go check on
your friend, who will also be
your sparring partner (a.k.a.
rival) in this game. Go ahead
and leave your house. Your
mother will bother one more time
to remind you that you don't
have any Pokemon of yourself,
and because of such you
shouldn't wander into tall grass
where Pokemon may roam. As soon
as you're outdoors, you'll see
four houses. The only two that
matter to you are the ones with
mailboxes. Of the four houses,
walk to the top-left one with
the mailbox, and up to the door.

As soon as you reach the door,
your rival will come bursting
out of it, and into you. After
he converses with you, he'll
forget something and return into
his house. Follow him into his
house, and up the stairs into
his bedroom. He'll talk with you
once more when you get upstairs,
and will leave soon after.

For some reason, there seems to
be much more dialogue and
character interaction this time
around. While that's a good
thing, it still takes up your
playing time! I suggest you go
into your Menu (by pressing X)
and select "Options". I, myself,
have the text set on "Fast". I'd
do the same if I were you.

Leave your rival's house and
walk north to Route 201.

    =---------------------------
    =- b. Route 201 and Verity
       Lakefront -=
    =---------------------------

Your rival will stop you and
talk about that television
report about the red Gyarados.
After suggesting that both of
you go and see if your local
lake has such a creature, he
asks you to lead. With him
following, head west to a place
called Verity Lakefront. Coming
soon is when you get to choose
your first Pokemon! You'll see a
2x2-sized patch of dirt leading
up to a gap in between the
trees. I suggest that you save
as soon as reach the dirt, as
you'll soon have no control over
events and will no longer have
the option to save in case you
want a specific starter (such as
having particular stats, or
gender).

As soon as you cross the patch
of dirt, your rival will begin
to talk to you, and afterwards
you'll both enter the lake
through the trees. When you both
enter the area, you'll see
Professor Rowan, this time in
person, and either the male or
female character that you didn't
choose as your gender when you
began the game talking to the
Professor. After a conversation
between the two, together they
will leave, with the Professor
leaving his briefcase behind.

Your rival will lead you into
the tall grass, against your
mother's wishes, and, surprise,
wild Pokemon attacks you! Both
of you look into the briefcase
to see if you can use one of the
Professor's Pokemon to help you
get out of this jam, and you get
first pick.

Your selection is a Grass
Pokemon called Turtwig, a Fire
Pokemon called Chimchar, and a
Water Pokemon called Piplup. The
most naive question that could
possibly be asked at this point
is which one to choose. I
will_not suggest to you a
particular starter Pokemon.
However, very unlike previous
Pokemon games, this time there
is not a singular starter that
will have an easier time or a
harder time battling against the
many Gyms. This time around, the
game is much more balanced in
that aspect, although I'd like
for you to know that Chimchar is
one of the _very_ few new Fire
Pokemon in this game. With this
in mind, if you know you like
Fire Pokemon, I highly suggest
you get Chimchar.

After you two have chosen your
Pokemon, you both will fight
each Starly separately. After
you win your first fight (Notice
I didn't give you any battling
tips), either Dawn (your female
friend) or Lukas (your male
friend), will come and pick up
the briefcase that was left
behind and run away. Once the
two of you leave the lake, walk
east to Route 201, where you two
will meet the Professor and your
friend. After a long
conversation, with both your
rival and yourself surprised at
the lack of anger of the
Professor, you two will split
ways. After the whole
conversation, you will suddenly
appear at your house.

After your mother talks to you
some more, she'll give you the
running shoes. Hold the B button
to run. This time around, you
can run inside buildings! Run
outside and towards Route 201 in
order to continue your
adventure. Run east through the
brush. On Route 201 you'll find
low-level Starly and Bidoof.
After you walk past the first
patch of grass, for a free
Potion, walk upwards and then
west on the raised land.
Continue to walk far west until
you come upon a group of
flowers. Press A while looking
west, but 2 steps away (2 steps
away, as in if you walked two
placed east from standing on top
of) the western-most flower.
You'll pick up an invisible
Potion.

Know that no one will battle you
on Route 201, so continue east
until you reach Sandgem Town.

    =---------------------------
    =- c. Sandgem Town -=
    =---------------------------

When you first arrive, your
friend (again, either Dawn or
Lukas) will stop you and lead
you into Professor Rowan's
laboratory. There, the Professor
will ask you to keep the Pokemon
you chose and for you to collect
information about the Pokemon
you see on your travels with a
device he'll give you. After you
agree, you'll receive something
called a Pokedex from him. With
this device, you can learn
detailed information about each
Pokemon that you've seen and
captured on your travels. After
more talking, run out of the
lab.

As soon as you leave the lab,
your friend will take you on a
tour of the town's featured
locales. On the short tour, she
briefly explains the Pokemon
Center and the Pokemart. After
she leaves, you can collect an
antidote at the beach below, to
the left.

Notice that you can already
wirelessly trade with people
nearby you in person at the
Pokemon Center. You can trade
with friends as well as battle
low-level Pokemon against each
other. Other than that, you can
send text messages. Other than
these wireless features, at the
Pokemon Center you can sign your
Trainer Card with your very own
signature.

As your friend suggested while
giving you the tour, you should
return to your hometown,
Twinleaf. When you walk into
your house, your mother will
give you a Journal after hearing
about the major help you're
giving the Professor. Things you
do in the game are automatically
recorded in this Key Item, so if
you have forgotten what you did
last, you can always check this.
Not only that, but if you
haven't played your game in a
long time, when you start the
game the journal will
automatically appear telling you
what you did last of
significance in the game.

After that, the mother of your
rival will walk into your house
looking for him. Your mother
will volunteer you to take a
package from your rival's mother
to her son. After all this,
return to Sandgem Town and head
north to Route 202.

    =---------------------------
    =-         d. Route 202     
    =---------------------------

When you arrive at the first
patch of grass, your friend will
stop you and show you how to
capture Pokemon. After the
demonstration, he or she will
give you 5 Pokeballs and will
leave afterwards. In this Route,
you will encounter your first
Trainer battles. If you're new
to Pokemon, know that you cannot
capture any of your opponent's
Pokemon, and any Pokeball that
you throw will be swatted away
and will be forfeited
permanently.

The first Trainer you will fight
will bring a level 5 Starly
against you. Know that there is
no escape from a trainer battle,
so be well prepared and save
before each one. This Starly
will know Quick Attack, which
will do much damage to a level 5
starter Pokemon. To ensure
survival, raise your starter
Pokemon to level 7 through
defeating wild encounters, and
capture and slightly raise a
Bidoof or Starly if you have
much trouble. I, myself, had all
three starter Pokemon from
trading with someone else
locally and restarting my game
twice. However, I had to capture
a junk Pokemon to meet the
2-Pokemon requirement to trade.

After the first fight, there's a
good chance your Pokemon are
pretty beat, so backtrack over
the ledge (avoiding the high
grass) towards the Pokemon
Center below you. Backtracking
will be common in your
adventure.

The next trainer that will fight
you will send out a level 3
Bidoof first. After your first
fight, this shouldn't be a
problem at all. After the girl's
first Pokemon goes down, she'll
send out another level 3 Bidoof.

Not just the first two, but also
the third is also a mandatory
fight! He'll begin and end the
fight by sending out a level 5
Shinx, an Electric Pokemon.
Shinx will mostly use Leer,
which lowers the defense of a
Pokemon, and will occassionally
use Tackle.

Those were the only three
Trainers you'll find on Route
202. Obviously the developers
wanted to make sure that noone
got too far without fighting
other trainers. Before you leave
the road, pick up a visible
Potion in the grass to the left.
Up next is Jubilife City, where
your rival's mother said her son
would probably be.

    =---------------------------
    =- e. Jubilife City -=
    =---------------------------

As soon as you enter the city,
your friend will confront you.
She or he'll tell you that your
rival went by the Pokemon School
within the city.

There are many places of
interest in this city. However,
most of them are off-limits,
especially the Global Trade
Station, which only becomes
accessible after you collect
your first Gym badge. The
Pokemart in this city has a
second person standing behind
the desk, who sells Air Mail for
50 Pokedollars and Heal Balls
for 300 Pokedollars (100
Pokedollars more than normal
Pokeballs) each. Just about
every single person inside the
city will first refer you to the
Pokemon School, so go there.

There are many students at the
school, but you merely want to
give your rival the parcel you
were bringing him from his
mother. It just so happens his
mother accidentally packed two
Town Maps, which is one more
than your rival needs. As a good
buddy should, he gives you the
other one! After your rival
leaves, you can read the
blackboard to learn information
about malignant status
conditions of Pokemon.

After you leave the school, walk
north, only to be stopped by a
man claiming to have invented a
special Pokemon watch, this
"Poketch." In order to get a
free Poketch from him, you need
to find three clowns in the city
and answer their questions.

1) One stands almost immediately
   east of the man, walking
   around in front of
the Pokemart. He asks you if
Pokemon grow by defeating others
and gaining Experience Points.
The answer is "Yes", which
rewards you with a coupon, #1.

2) Another is at the very
   northwestern area of the
   town, near a two-door blue
building. He asks if the moves
of a Pokemon can have a type
like the Pokemon that uses them
can. The correct answer is
"Yes". He gives you Coupon #2.

3) The last one stands in front
   of the city's television
   broadcasting building.
He asks you if Pokemon can hold
items, and the answer is "Yes".
He gives you Coupon #3.

Hand the man his coupons, and he
rewards you with a free Poketch!
This device will eventually
contain 23 different
applications! Right now it shows
the time (which goes by the DS's
built-in clock), it functions as
a calculator, it functions as a
Step Counter (which can be reset
at your will), and it can show
the health of your party of
Pokemon. The Poketch is always
on, and you can toggle between
its functions by pressing the
big red button on the right of
the touch screen.

Exit through a building to the
northwest and talk to a man in a
red hat inside the small
building to receive an Old Rod
from him. With this item you can
now fish. Route 218 to the west
is a nice fishing spot, but you
cannot go any further into the
Route, as it is mostly made up
of Water.

In the northern apartment
building within Jubilife City, a
young woman on the first floor
will give you a Pokemon-held
item called the "Quick Claw".
This speeds up the attacks of
your Pokemon (not the Pokemon
itself) when it holds this item
in battle.

Don't head north to Route 204,
as it leads to a cave that is
blocked off for now. Instead,
head east to Route 203.

    =---------------------------
    =-         f. Route 203     
    =---------------------------

When you first arrive at Route
203, you are challenged to a
battle by your rival. He starts
the battle by sending out a
level 7 Starly. This is your
fourth Pokemon Trainer battle,
and I myself am already
surprised by the quickly rising
difficulty of the game. He will
next send out a level 9 starter
Pokemon that has a natural
advantage against the one you
chose. I, myself, had a close
match against him. Because most
of these earlier battles are
rather simple, I can't give you
much helpful information, as
brute force wins early on.

In the first area, the battles
are much tougher, although you
can avoid every single one of
them, as opposed to Route 202.
Of the two items in this area,
there's a very-accessible
Pokeball within a Pokeball soon
upon exiting the fight with your
rival. There's also a Repel way
north, which can be very
helpful. It'll repel most
Pokemon whose level is equal to
or lower than your lead
Pokemon's level--another reason
to level your Pokemon a lot.

I, myself, avoided all the
fights because I didn't want my
Pokemon to level up too quickly.
If you have no Gym badges and
your Pokemon level up too
quickly, they can become unruly,
and especially so if you got
them in a trade--that's very
important for those who
restarted twice to have all
three starter Pokemon. East is
the Oreburgh Gate, which is a
cave that leads to Oreburgh
City.

    =---------------------------
    =- g. Oreburgh Gate -=
    =---------------------------

Upon immediatley entering the
cave, a man will greet you with
a gift. The Hidden Machine given
to you, number 6, contains the
move "Rock Smash". This allows
you to break away certain rocks
(you can tell what you can break
by just looking at them).
Luckily, you don't have to teach
your Pokemon this utility-only
move this early on, as the
Oreburgh City Gym badge is
required to use it outside of
battle--it's only good use.

Both trainers in this place can
be walked around. You'll mostly
find Geodudes in this place,
which are pure Rock-type
Pokemon. Exit this small place,
only to immediately enter
Oreburgh City itself.

    =---------------------------
    =- h. Oreburgh City -=
    =- FIRST GYM - Leader: Roark
       -=
    =---------------------------

You're almost there--you're so
close to going up against your
first Gym leader of the game.
Early upon walking into the
city, a boy will escort you to
the location of the first Gym,
with your rival standing outside
its front door.

According to your rival, the Gym
leader isn't there! Apparently
he has gone to work in the
mines. Before you go, retreive a
free Dusk Ball from a woman
walking around the second floor
of the first building you saw
when you entered the city. In
the very next building to the
right, a girl on the first floor
is willing to trade you an Abra
for your Machop (you can catch
one in the grass immediately
above the city) Another feebie
can be collected from a boy of
the second story of a building
to the southeast of the city.
From him you can get a Great
Ball.

The only path you can take is
south towards the mine. If you
maneuver yourself to the
northwestern-most part of the
field, you can find hidden
Stardust in the left corner of
the slagheap. You can also
receive a free Super Potion from
the man working with his Machop
in the southeastern-most part of
that same area. From this
immediate area, go down into the
actual mining area past the
descending slope.

In the mines, you are liable to
get attacked by wild Rock-type
Pokemon, such as Onix and
Geodude. After you go down the
major slope, you'll come across
an area with a gigantic lump of
coal in the middle. Walk around
it and talk to the guy in
between two pieces of rock. That
would be Roark. One you've
talked with him, he'll
immediately leave, presumably
for his Gym. Walk around the
right side of the coal, since
the left has a ledge to it
(although there is an escape
rope in a Pokeball to the left).

Roark's Pokemon Gym is open for
business! He is by far one of
the toughest first Gym leaders I
have ever seen. There are two
very valuable Pokemon that are
available to you. If you chose
Turtwig, you can raise him or
her up to level 13, at which it
will learn Razor Leaf. If you
didn't choose Turtwig (and
Piplup's Bubble isn't much
help), you can catch a Budew at
Route 204 (north of Jubilife
City), which learns Mega Drain
at level 13. Either of these
Pokemon with those moves will
prove to be very useful at this
Gym. Since both of these levels
are somewhat high for not even
having beaten the first Gym
leader, it would be advised to
fight any skipped trainers.

Gym Leader Roark's Pokemon are:
(1) Geodude:  Lv. 12
(2) Onix:     Lv. 12
(3) Cranidos: Lv. 14

After you win, you get 1680
Pokedollars, TM76 (Stealth
Rock), and the Coal Badge (Look
at your Trainer Card to see
it!). With this Badge, your
Pokemon will be able to use HM06
that you received just before
entering the city. You can also
rub the League Badge with your
stylus or finger while looking
at it on your Trainer Card in
order to make it shine. At first
it's dull, but you can rub it
until you see four white lights
sparkle.

Before you leave the city, head
to the Pokemon Center. You'll
notice that no one blocks the
escalator. As soon as you walk
down it, a woman at behind a
desk will summon you, and from
her you'll receive the Pal Pad
Key Item. With this, you can
register the WiFi codes of your
friends so you can play with
them online. Remember how you
used to be blocked from the GTS
station at Jubilife City before?
Now that you have your first Gym
Badge, that's not the case
anymore! In addition, you can
choose your online avator by
speaking to the older guy to the
left. Depending on your Trainer
ID, you have 8 different sets of
four choices to choose from.

Since you can go no further
without a Bicycle, all you can
do now is head back, west
towards Jubilife City.


--------------------------------
 2) On towards the 2nd Gym
--------------------------------

As soon as you begin to leave
Oreburgh City, your rival will
slam into you from behind. He
points you out to a place called
Eterna City as the next
available Gym. Route 207, the
path north of the city I said
was impassable without a
bicycle, your rival also tells
you requires a bike. As you
enter the Gate, you can now
smash the rocks within it,
providing you used HM06 on
something. If you travel north
through it, further than
previously accessible, you can
collect TM70 (Flash) and some
Stardust from the floor below.
In order to travel further in
the basement of the Gate, you
need a bicycle or a Pokemon that
can surf.

While you're here, you can
collect the Memo Pad Poketch app
from the owner of the Poketch
company, of which the building
is located at the northwestern
part of the city. You couldn't
do this before because you
hadn't had one badge yet. Come
back later to receive another
app after you get two more
badges.

After you're done with touring
the GTS at Jubilife City, travel
north towards Route 204. You
will see your friend and
Professor Rowan talking to a
couple of people. It turns out
that you and your friend are
going to double team Team
Galactic (Your first double
battle)! They will send out
against the two of you a level 9
Zubat and level 9 Wurmple. This
fight should be too easy. After
you win the battle, someone from
Jubilife TV Company will give a
Key Item called the Fashion
Case. With all this done, the
Television Station building is
open. You can tour that as well
if you like. If not, head
towards Route 204 again!

    =---------------------------
    =- a. Route 204 and Ravaged
       Path -=
    =---------------------------

The only new addition to the
Pokemon here is Budew, which you
might needed to have used
against the first Gym leader.
There are three trainers before
a cave shortly ahead of you, a
cave called the Ravaged Path.
This cave is rather small, and
the only path you can really
travel is right back out off to
the right. However, slightly to
the left is TM39 (Rock Tomb).

The first trainer that will
battle you when you come out of
the cave is difficult to dodge,
and I wouldn't bother attempting
to dodge her every time you pass
by. Take out her Budew and
Cherubi with ease. The second
person willing to fight is a lot
easier to dodge. You can later
return and cut down some bushes
to find a woman who will give
you TM78 (Captivate). Along the
path you'll come across TM09
(Bullet Seed). Route 204 is very
short, as you soon arrive at
Floaroma Town.

    =---------------------------
    =- b. Floaroma Town -=
    =---------------------------

I tell you what--this place is
ridiculous. There are more
flowers in this one place than
in any other one Pokemon game.
If you haven't noticed yet, the
Pokemarts you continue to find
are selling more and more items,
especially here. Out of all the
new items, the Net Ball is
probably of the most importance
to you, that is if you're having
difficulty capturing Water and
Bug-type Pokemon.

A woman in the flower shop will
give you an Aspear Berry if you
talk to her. Another woman in
that same shop will give you the
Sprayduck watering can, so you
can water the berries that you
may plant on your adventure.
Make sure that when you come
across a berry tree that was
planted in a place before you
ever got there to pick it as
soon as possible. All plants die
off eventually, and an accessory
for your Poketch that you
acquire later in the game only
tracks the plants that you have
planted.

It won't take you long to find
Team Galactic huddled in a
corner at the top- left part of
town. Why don't you pay them a
visit? At first that'll do no
good to you, so walk a little
ways east through Route 205
until a girl stops you and asks
you to take care of the space-
outfitted men. Return and you'll
see that they've disappeared. Go
through the trees and you'll
find them once again, with their
backs to you. Apparently they're
trying to take "Sweet Honey"
from this man.

Fight them. This is not a double
battle, but you'll be up against
both, one by one. The first
Grunt will send out a level 9
Wurmple. You won't have issues
with this Pokemon. The second
Pokemon the enemy will send out
is a level 9 Silcoon. After the
first fight, the next Grunt will
only send out a level 11 Zubat.
When you beat them, the man they
accosted will pick up an item
they accidentally left behind
and give you this "Works Key".
The man will also give you some
Honey. He tells you that if you
use it on a sweet-smelling tree,
Pokemon might be attracted. An
example of what a "sweet-
smelling tree" might look like
is off to the right. Exit when
you're done, which you are.

    =---------------------------
    =- c. Route 205 and Valley
       Windworks -=
    =---------------------------

On Route 205, where the girl
first stopped you, notice that
you cannot travel northward to
the Eterna Forest, due to some
Team Galactic Grunts standing in
the way. Notice the windmills as
you soon pass into Valley
Windworks what I consider the
first visually impressive object
in a Pokemon game ever--the
windmills. Fight the person
standing in between you, and
getting inside that building. He
has a level 11 Glameow.

So you know, Route 205 has a
completely different set of wild
Pokemon to capture. Anyway, I
personally am enjoying the
occasional Internet jargon usage
in the game such as "noob" and
"owned". Well, the person you
apparently "owned" just locked
the door behind him when you
beat him. Unlock the door and
just walk right on in, but not
before healing your Pokemon!

As soon as you walk in, the guy
who you recently defeated tells
you that he is going to alert
his boss. I'm going to assume
you're fighting the first
person, and not the second in
this small building. The first
guy throws his only Pokemon, a
level 11 Cascoon at you. I
caught a level 9 Shellos right
outside that defeated it in two
hits of Water Pulse. I
personally skipped the second
guy.

Walk right up to the guy with
red hair. Apparently he's one of
Team Galactic's three
Commanders. Commander Mars
challenges you to a fight. He
first throws a level 14 Zubat at
you. The Zubat will immediately
use Toxic on any Pokemon you
throw at it, which badly
poisons, that is, poisons a
Pokemon that damages more HP
every turn, as opposed to normal
poison. The next Pokemon he
sends out is a level 16 Purugly
that's holding an Oran Berry
(which automatically cures 10 HP
when you whittle its health down
to halfway). Don't feel bad if
you had trouble with both of
these Pokemon, because I did
too.

1280 Pokedollars isn't enough to
pay for the crap that fool put
you through. After all that,
Team Galactic leaves, and you
get nothing for reuniting a
daughter and father. Anyway, on
your way out, know that Drifloon
will appear right outside the
Valley Windworks building every
Friday. It's level is around the
20s and it is of the
Ghost/Flying-Type. Surprisingly,
poison won't kill Pokemon in the
field this time around. It'll
simply reduce their HP to 1
before going away. You soon
learn this after dealing with
the many Pokemon of Team
Galactic.

When you've healed your Pokemon
head north through Route 205.
There is almost no trainer here
you can't skip. The lower path
leads to nowhere right now, but
if you take it, there's an
Antidote hidden on the seemingly
useless platform. Remember that
running will always attract the
immediate attention of anyone
who looks around for trainers.
Also, just because a person
walks around doesn't mean they
won't fight you. It certainly
lowers the possibility, but
there's one non-stationary
female picnicker here that will
fight you.

Towards the end of Route 205,
there is a house with a couple
inside. The woman will offer you
a bed to heal your Pokemon and
rest yourself. Mine were pretty
beat, so I suggest you don't
risk things and take a nap.
Later when you have Cut, you can
skip the Eterna Forest as you go
through Route 205 and collect
SilverPowder (Ups Bug-Type
Moves) and TM82 (Sleep Talk). In
addition, a woman nearby in the
initially-blocked area will give
you a "Big Tree" for your
Fashion Case. After you heal up,
head the only way you can go,
right into the Eterna Forest.

    =---------------------------
    =- d. Eterna Forest -=
    =---------------------------

Soon after you walk into the
forest, a girl named Cheryl
stops you to ask a favor. She
doesn't want to go through the
forest by herself with Pokemon
that tend to appear in pairs and
Team Galactic on the loose. Help
each other out and find the exit
together, because as she said,
there's "safety in numbers".
This also happens to be the very
first time in Pokemon history
where you, the gamer, has the
opportunity to fight wild
Pokemon in Double Battles.

Cheryl uses a Chansey level 15,
and isn't bad at all in the
actual fights. The only real
time she'd get in your way is if
you're trying to capture a
certain Pokemon. She'll cause
the one you're trying the catch
faint quite often, which can get
really annoying. There are many
new Pokemon in this place, such
as Murkrow and Buneary, so I
suggest that you spend some time
in here if you're interested in
your Pokedex. However, know that
you cannot capture any wild
Pokemon if there are two in the
field, and it also becomes much
more difficult to escape from
battle. Noramlly you'll have to
make one faint.

While it is difficult to capture
Pokemon now, however it is very
difficult to black out, as after
each battle Cheryl, as she
promised you, completely heals
your Pokemon (presumably with
her Chansey). That's a very good
thing, especially since it's
rather difficult to run away
from fights in the forest.

There are a couple mandatory
trainer battles. This first
time, the enemy has more than
one Pokemon per trainer. The
first two sent out are a level 9
Wurmple and a level 14
Pachirisu. After you defeat the
first two, the third, a level 13
Beautifly will come by itself,
though you won't be given the
option to change your Pokemon at
the switch no matter what.

After the first mandatory
trainer battle, you fight a pair
of psychics who only send out
one pair of level 15 Abra's. The
two of them do one thing, and
one thing only--Hidden Power. At
least you get more money from
Double Battles than Single
Battles.

Only two Double Battles are
mandatory. While they are pretty
cool, they take up a lot of
time. After them, I used a repel
and ran way up north through the
grass, passing by every pair of
trainers. There's nothing that
special in this place to pick
up. To go anywhere, you need
Cut. As soon as you make it to
the exit in the northeastern
area of the forest, Cheryl will
leave you.

This means that you can go back
and capture anything she
prevented you from capturing.
However, this also means that
you're on your own, and you
won't be healed after every
battle from now on. However,
when you return much later with
an Eevee, head to the rock in
the southwestern part and level
up your Eevee around that rock
if you want it to evolve into
the Leaf-Type Leafeon. Do
whatever you feel like needs to
be done before you leave, then
head to Route 205 towards Eterna
City.

Really, the second, smaller part
of Route 205 doesn't deserve its
own section. Walk over the
bridge, fighting the fishermen
only if you want to and
collecting the berries to the
north, and cross over into
Eterna City.

    =---------------------------
    =- e. Eterna City -=
    =- SECOND GYM - Leader:
       Gardenia -=
    =---------------------------

There is a_lot to do in Eterna
City. You may not even know
where to start, and you're
probably wondering what's up
with Team Galactic walking
around. First of all, I think
it's pretty obvious from the
header of this section that you
can go up against your second
Gym. Luckily, there's no side-
quest needed to challenge the
Gym leader, so you can beat that
whenever you feel like. Before I
go into further detail about the
Gym, there are many other places
of interest in the city that you
need to know about.

First of all, east of the
Pokemon Center, inside of which
is a woman who gives you the
Happiness Checker app for your
Poketch, is the house of the
Underground Man. Talk to the
older man towards the mid-right
part of the house to receive an
Explorer Kit. This is a very
important device, as a lot
occurs underground. Go ahead and
take up the older man's
challenge and walk outside in
order to go straight underground
to see how it feels like.

As soon as you go underground,
you'll be greeted by Roark, the
leader of the first Gym you beat
quite some time ago. No, you
won't fight any Pokemon down
there. Return to the old man and
he'll give you three traps for
your underground playtime. He
next asks you to dig up some
treasure spheres for him. He
explains that you should go to
the yellow dots on your map and
use your stylus to find places
to dig. Tap the screen to find
places to dig. After you dig
some spheres up, talk to the old
man again. He'll give you three
spheres. He next asks you to go
bury some spheres--do it!
Remember where you place things,
bury something, and return.
He'll give you the Digger Drill
in return.

It's good that you have the
Digger Drill now, as the entire
time you've been working towards
being able to make your Secret
Base! Just like the last game,
you can make your Secret Base
anywhere you like, but this time
on the walls of the underground.
I'll cover the Secret Base in
more depth in a later section of
this guide, but for now know
that when you use the Digger
Drill, like a TM, it breaks.
Don't worry, as you can always
trade a sphere underground for
another one.

Anyway, you can return to the
surface and collect a Plain
Table, a Wooden Chair, a Small
Bookshelf, and a Buneary Doll
from the old man for your Secret
Base. Use the stuff he gave you
to complete his final test for a
Doll of your starter Pokemon.

Just before you leave, talk to
him again to learn how to get
rid of the annoying boulders in
your base. (1) Find a friend's
Secret Base (2) Go to your PC
and steal your friend's Flag.
(3) Run back to your PC with the
Flag.

This is something that can only
be done with a friend, so if you
can't play with someone else
right now, I suggest you move
on.

It's good that you got that out
of the way, because there are
many more things to do. You'll
notice that the Bicycle Shop's
owner is gone, and apparently is
at Team Galactic's base to the
north. Go there, only to be
stopped by someone named
Cynthia, who will give you HM01
(Cut). We'll worry further about
this when it's time to beat the
Gym.

The Herb Shop, which sells
inexpensive medicine that makes
your Pokemon unhappy with you is
to the right of Team Galactic's
Base. The Name Rater, who rates
names and allows you to give
Pokemon new nicknames is east of
the Pokemart, which now sells
Nestballs, sitting on the first
floor of the condominiums. Also
on that same floor is someone
willing to give you a Chatot in
exchange for a Buizel, which I
conveniently caught from Route
205 right before I fought
Commander Mars. His "Charap"
will be at the same level as and
the same level of the Buizel you
give him.

Now you can focus your attention
on the Gym. By the way, there's
a Super Potion behind it. You'll
have to walk through the trees
from the left. Anyway, I trained
at Route 211 to the east in
order to help me win.

The Gym's leader will greet you
and tell you that you must
defeat all other trainers before
you can get to her. Walk through
the door after she leaves. It's
your job to find the
competition. This Gym might as
well had been a Ninja Gym, with
Fighting Pokemon, as the people
are pretty hard to spot. I'll
help you about by getting you to
each of the trainers.

(1) Walk north from the entrance
until you reach where the Gym
leader obviously will eventually
appear at. Walk left through the
trees from that green platform
nearby. Immediately walk south,
and press A on the person hiding
in the corner.
    This person's Pokemon is a
    level 15 Cherbi and a level
    15 Roselia.
(2) The next trainer's location
is told to you by the first
trainer you defeated. As stated
by her, she's past the two
boulders down to the left.
    This person has a lvl. 14
    Budew, a lvl. 13 Budew, and
    a lvl. 15 Budew.
(3) The previous trainer also
hinted that this next one is in
the middle of three trees. While
you did pass these trees on the
way to the first person, only
now do they appear. As you walk
back towards the entrance, you
can't miss her standing behind
the middle of the three fake
trees.
    This girl merely wields a
    level 17 Turtwig...good
    luck.
(4) You are told that your next
opponent is beside four flowers.
From the entrance, walk east and
up the long path to find a
blonde haired girl in the
corner. This girl is also the
last. After her, the Gym leader
appears.
 She uses one level 17 Roselia.

Gym Leader Gardenia's Pokemon
are: (1) Cherubi: Lv. 19 (2)
Turtwig: Lv. 19 (3) Roserade (w/
Sitrus Berry): Lv. 22

There are many helpful Pokemon
that you can bring to this
fight. There's Chimchar, that
learns Flame Wheel at level 17,
or its evolved form Monferno,
which learns Flame Wheel two
level later at 19. In addition,
there are many Flying-type
Pokemon as well as one good bug
Pokemon (Kricketune) that you
can bring to this fight, so this
shouldn't be too difficult.

2640 is the amount of
Pokedollars that you get, in
addition to TM86 (Grass Knot),
and the Forest Badge, which
allows you to use Cut outside of
battle and makes all Pokemon up
to level 30 obey you without
question.


--------------------------------
3) Going After the Third Badge
--------------------------------

Before you go after Team
Galactic, if you have seen 35
Pokemon head south to the gate
towards Cycling Road. The man
who is Professor Rowan's
assistant and your friend's
father is waiting to reward you
with your progress on your
Pokedex with an Exp. Share! With
this, raising weaker Pokemon
becomes a lot easier!

Anyway, with Cut, you can now go
a great many more places, such
as Team Galactic's base at the
northern part of the city.
Before you head into the
building, cut the bush to the
right and collect TM46 (Thief)
off to the right.

Only two of the four people here
will fight you, and they're the
couple standing near the
stairway. They, together, both
send out a level 13 Wurmple and
a level 14 Zubat. Glameow at
level 14 replaces the Zubat,
whenever you kill it, and
Cascoon at level 13 replaces the
Wurmple, whenever you kill that.

You can skip everyone on the
second floor if you like with
ease. On the third floor, the
first mandatory fight will start
off with a level 12 Wurmple
pitted against you. The second
Pokemon will be a level 12
Silcoon. Lastly, you will fight
a level 12 Zubat. The second
fight on the third floor will
have a scientist use a level 15
Kadabra against you.

On the fourth and last floor,
you'll see a man and a purple-
haired woman staring at each
other. Talk to the purple-haired
girl to start a fight with
Commander Jupiter and her level
18 Zubat and level 20 Skuntank
holding a Sitrus Berry. I had
one Pokemon left with 9 HP when
I beat her; so don't feel bad if
you struggled. Her Skuntank is
ridiculous, I know. Out of her
stupidity and your dumb luck is
how you'll most likely win that
battle. After you win, Team
Galactic will leave, so talk to
the Bicycle Shop owner. He'll
thank you and then leaves.

Before you leave, go get
yourself a Bicycle from the man
you just helped out. Unlike the
last game, which had you switch
out bicycles every time you
wanted to do something different
with your bike (either do tricks
or go really fast), this time
all you have to do is press the
B button to change between the
third (for tricks) and fourth
(for speed) gears--way more
convenient! If you try to exit
west back towards Route 205, a
man will stop you and say that
you can go to Hearthome City by
the way of Cycling Road.
Remember that you can only mount
your bike when you're still, but
you can change gears at any
time. Go ahead and register it
for your Y button in the menu.

Don't bother heading east, as
there's only TM12 (Taunt) way
below on Route 211, which is
rather useless unless you like
pulling tricks, such as Taunt +
Bide combo or you like
collecting things. Head south
towards Cycling Road/"Route 206"
instead.

    =---------------------------
    =- a. Routes 206-207 -=
    =---------------------------

When you first arrive at the
Cycling Road, you'll notice that
you cannot dismount your bike at
all. There will be a slew of
trainers along the path, and it
is extremely difficult to dodge
them all, even though many can
be dodged, if not by skill but
by luck. Most of the cyclists
here use electric Pokemon, so
bringing either a Ground or
Rock-type Pokemon would prove
useful.

As soon as you pass this short
road, you can get a free "Flag"
(for your Fashion Case) from the
blonde-haired girl in the
building to the south. After you
pass the actual biking part,
you'll still be on Route 206,
but you can now cut down some
bushes and walk right under the
bridge, capturing some new
Pokemon along the way if you
want. The featured Pokemon under
the bridge are Ponyta and
Stunks. There's a Poison Barb to
the northwest, which boosts
Poison- Type moves when a
Pokemon holds it, and Wayward
Cave (which is dark inside) is
to the north.

Eventually go back to the main
road when you're done. Route 207
is right below Route 206. Almost
as soon as you enter, your
friend shows up and asks you to
pick a hand that's behind her
back. I picked the left hand and
she gave me the Vs. Seeker (Key
Item that allows you to refight
trainers) and the Dowsing
Machine (Poketch app that acts
as an Item Finder, except much
more practical). After you're
done talking with her, she will
leave. Now the road splits--you
can either take a detour and
heal up at Oreburgh City down
below, or you can go right.

Since there's nothing about
Oreburgh City that's new that I
can tell you about, I'll
continue to walk you through the
game as if you didn't break and
continued east. You'll soon run
into a mandatory Double Battle.
They will send out one pair of a
level 19 Ponyta and Pachirisu.
This is an actually difficult
battle, as both of these Pokemon
have the ability to hurt many
significant weaknesses.

There are no further mandatory
battles before you reach Coronet
Mountain unless you want to get
a hidden Rare Candy next to a
hiker near a bridge that's hard
to miss. I suggest you heal
before you head into Mt.
Coronet.

    =---------------------------
    =- b. Mt. Coronet -=
    =---------------------------

When you walk into Mt. Coronet,
you'll head south then east
some. At a pair of ramps, a
blue-haired man will stop you
and quote what's apparently
Pokemon mythology. After he
talks for a bit, he'll leave.
You really can't go far yet in
this cave. You'll have to be
able to use Surf to go anywhere
else but the short exit to the
right.

There's also not much to collect
here for now. There's an ether
hiding on a rock up the ramp
above you, and below you there's
nothing but more water to tread.
You can either break rocks using
Rock Smash to head east, or you
can walk over the ramp above and
walk around. Either way, nothing
happens here, and there aren't
even any new Pokemon to capture.
Once you're done with this
place, which is probably now,
exit to Route 208.

    =---------------------------
    =-         c. Route 208     
    =---------------------------

There's an X Speed on the
platform down northward, so you
don't have to bother going after
it, unless you're dying for 250
Pokedollars. The Hiker is a
mandatory fight, unfortunately.
He'll send out two level 17
Geodudes, but that's nothing you
haven't dealt with before. "LOL"
is all I have to say. This is
the third time I've seen slang
used in a Pokemon game. First
noob as soon as you walked into
Oreburgh City, second "owned"
when you went into Valley
Windworks, and now "served" by
this Hiker right before you head
into a new locale. Graphics
weren't the only thing enhanced
about this game.

The second hiker looks like he's
a mandatory battle, but he
actually does move around from
time to time. However, do you
really want to dodge a guy that
difficult to dodge every time
you go by here? I didn't think
so, so beat up his one level 19
Onix--no problem. You have the
ability to capture a few new
Pokemon in this area, and right
before you reach Hearthome City,
the Berry Master's house is to
the northeast. In his house is a
girl who will give you the Berry
Searcher app for your Poketch if
you answer yes to her question.
All you do now is walk east into
Hearthome City.

    =---------------------------
    =- d. Hearthome City -=
    =---------------------------

Almost as soon as you walk in, a
woman's Buneary runs into you.
After thanking you for allowing
her to put her Pokemon into its
ball, Keira, a Pokemon Contest
Judge, tells you to drop by the
Contest Hall so that she can
thank you properly (i.e., a
gift).

This is another big city, just
like Eterna. Unfortunately,
nothing new is sold here, which
may seem surprising at first
(like, where's the Great
Balls?), but remember that you
haven't even beaten the third
Gym yet.

When you first enter the town,
it's pretty much a dead end. You
can't go anywhere else for now,
as two men block the east gate.
The guy standing near them will
give you a Happiny Egg. If you
want this Baby Chansey, drop off
a Pokemon at the Pokemon Center
and pick it up from him. As soon
as you pick it up from him, turn
to your Pedometer on your
Poketch--reset it. It'll hatch
in 10,240 steps, so save before
it hatches so you'll get exactly
what you want.

Anyway, go by the Pokemon Fan
Club, which is straight ahead
behind the man in the red cap
standing before you. The
Chairman (man, does this place
look familiar!) gives you a
Poffin Case, which boosts the
various different kinds of
visual appeal to Pokemon. In the
apartment building to the right
of the Pokemon Fan Club, a woman
on the second floor will give
you a Shell Bell, which restores
HP to a Pokemon that inflicts
damage upon another.

If you want to make Poffin for
your Pokemon, you can enter the
house next door to the left of
the Pokemart. You use berries to
make the Poffin, which increase
the visual attributes.

East of the Pokemon Center is a
girl named Bebe. After you talk
to her, "Someone's PC" when you
access a PC turns to "Bebe's PC"
from now on, which doesn't
really do much, but happens in
every Pokemon game.

Before you go after the bigger
stuff like the Contest and the
Gym, take a stroll in Amity
Square. You have to take a cute
Pokemon with you to enter,
although that Happiny egg you
just receive probably won't
hatch for a long, long-butt
time. Hopefully you caught
something like a Pachirisu on
Route 204.

At Amity Square, you can get a
lot of free items. Almost as
soon as you enter, you can get
TM43 (Secret Power) to the
right. TM45 (Attract) is also
towards the top of this place. A
girl tells you near the east
gate that you should talk to
your Pokemon often, as it will
pick up things for your Fashion
Case. Every 200 steps your
Pokemon will pick up something.
North of that girl in the left
old building is an Amulet Coin,
which doubles the money earned
in battle when held by a
Pokemon. There's also a Spooky
Plate, for turning your Arceus
into the Ghost type. Arceus is
the very last Pokemon, number
493, which can change into many
different Elemental types when
you give it plates.

Back to business: Go to the
Contest area and this city's Gym
leader, Fantina, with her crazy
purple hair, will leave. When
you enter the place, the person
you helped out earlier when you
entered Hearthome City, Keira,
notices you as she was talking
with mother. Apparently, your
mother is the famous Johanna.
Keira gives you Glitter Powder
for your Fashion Case. As Keira
leaves, your mother will give
you a Tuxedo for you to wear
when you enter contests. Walk up
to the man at the counter to get
free Mild Poffin from him. The
middle counter is for when you
compete alone, the one on the
right is for practicing, and the
one on the left is for competing
with friends in the Super
Contests.

Let's fight your rival. Attempt
to exit the place, having saved
beforehand if you think you need
to. He has a level 19 Starly, a
level 20 Buizel, a level 21
evolved starter that has the
elemental advantage of yours,
and a level 20 Roselia. Flay
him. Receive 2100 Pokedollars
from him. He'll leave to
challenge the Veilstone Gym. Now
even though you haven't defeated
the Gym (with a still- absent
leader), Route 209 is already
open. By the way, have you
looked at your Trainer Card yet?
Fantina ought to look rather
familiar--she's definitely not
the next one you're after.

    =---------------------------
    =-         e. Route 209     
    =---------------------------

Soon after you enter, take the
Good Rod off the hands of the
guy fishing. A mandatory battle
with a level 19 Bonsley and
level 19 Mime Jr. occurs right
before you can go any further.
Don't talk to the Pikachu, as it
is a trainer in disguise. Walk
east then north a bit. If you
take a rather difficult bike
path to the left, you can get a
Calcium. You can avoid the
trainer at the top of the
immediate mud slope if you walk
in the grass, but that'd be
annoying to do every time,
wouldn't it? Take the hidden
Awakening on the rock near the
mud slope, and take the slope
and clobber that girl's 5
Bidoofs. Pass the monument on
the right, as it does you not
good, and head into the next
town.

    =---------------------------
    =- f. Solaceon Town -=
    =---------------------------

I'm not fond of skipping Gyms,
but Fantina is way out of your
league for now. The very first
man you see on the road in this
place will give you the Pokemon
History app for your Poketch.

The Pokemon Day Care Center is
here, where an older couple
raises two Pokemon for you.
Basically, while you leave your
Pokemon with them, for each step
you take, that Pokemon gains 1
Experience Point under their
Care. If you leave two Pokemon
of opposite gender and similar
species, an egg (that will be
the female) might be given to
you after such two parents are
left for a while.

If you leave a Pokemon with the
woman, exit the house and
return, there'll be a man
sitting down who will give you
the Day Care Checker app.

Off to the right, there are
ledges that lead to different
places. Take the second ledge to
reach the middle house, where a
woman will give you a Seal Case,
which allows you to decorate
your Pokeballs.

The Solaceon Unown Ruins are
furthest east, after you jump
the rightmost ledges
continually.

The only way this town makes up
for its severe lack of things to
do is the fact that the Pokemart
has one new item for being
purchased, which is the Dusk
Ball
--something you'll learn to love
  not too long from now. Pass
  this place and
head through Route 210.

    =---------------------------
    =- g. Routes 210-215 -=
    =---------------------------

You can pass almost everyone
here, either it be through the
grass or by crossing the
platforms with the bike in
fourth gear. Before you come
across a cafe, a woman on an
earth platform to the right will
give you TM51 (Roost). There are
three people you can battle in
this cafe. The collector on the
right of the table has three
Sudowoodos. The one on the left
has three Mr. Mimes. The woman
in the center has a level 22
Clefairy. No one else fights
you. The woman sells you Moo Moo
Milk for $500.

You'll notice that behind the
shop Psyducks are blocking the
path. At this time there's
nothing you can do about that.

Obviously, it never stops
raining at Route 215--that also
affects the battles. Water and
Electric moves' power is
enhanced, and Fire moves' power
is decreased.

The first mandatory fight
against the Ruin Maniac starts
you off against his level 21
Bronzor. This is especially
difficult if you're relying on
Monferno to fight it, as Fire's
power, again, is weakened
against a Steel_and_Psychic, of
which allows it to exploit
Monferno's secondary Fighting-
Type. The next thing sent out is
a level 23 Shieldon--probably
the first of this Steel-Type
you've ever seen. Water moves
are especially effective this
time.

The item the nearby man circles
is an Ether, so if you don't
feel articulate enough to snag
it, don't worry about it. Just
be careful when passing him by.
The Karate guy looking the away
from you will give you TM66
(Payback). When two bridges meet
on a raised platform, there's a
hidden Honey on the right
flower. As you continue around
that platform, you can cut down
the grass at the upper- right
part of the screen to fight a
karate guy in order to get a
Fist Plate (for that Arceus you
won't be getting). If you passed
the previous karate guy through
the brush, there was a Guard
Spec. down from the southern
bridge as you came across two
raised bridges.

Don't be fooled by the eventual
clear path between trees--
there's another karate guy
hiding behind the bottom one.
Instead, pass through the grass.
Before you come across the last
mandatory battle for this
location, there's TM34 (Shock
Wave) behind some grass that can
be cut.

All four Pokemon thrown at you
are level 23 beasts. The first
two are Glameow and Monferno.
Monferno when defeated is
replaced by Gyarados. Glameow,
when defeated, is replaced by
Kadabra. This is one tough
fight. I barely got by this
fight, which is why I'm happy
that I got you, and now you, go
to Veilstone City. Notice that
as you passed through the
building, the man said that he
couldn't go to Celestic City due
to some Pokemon blocking the
road. That could mean to get to
Celestic City that you need to
take care of those Psyduck...

    =---------------------------
    =- h. Veilstone City -=
    =- THIRD GYM - Leader:
       Maylene -=
    =---------------------------

With your first look at the
city, you might notice that a
major Team Galactic's
headquarters is stationed here,
guarded at all entrances by some
of their members. As you walk
the only way you can, you'll
notice that it's not going to be
convenient walking from place to
place, as almost everything is
elevated on top of rocks.

At the first fork, take a right
and heal at the Pokemon Center.
The two houses above the center
won't do anything for you, but
the department store left of
them sure will. This is the
first time you've ever gotten a
real Pokemart upgrade, so take
advantage of this opportunity to
spend the money you've collected
up until now. I'll give you a
rundown of the different floors.
(1) Medicine and Items (2)
Battle Items and their
permanently upgrading versions
(3) Utility and Greatly-Damaging
Technical Machines (4) Dolls and
other Miscellaneous Secret Base
Items (5) Vending Machines

Also, on the second floor, the
one of the women behind the
counter will give you the
Counter app for your Poketch.

Leave the department store when
you're done. At the next fork,
you'll immediately notice
craters with asteroids in them.
They are there so that if you
have a Deoxys transferred from a
GBA game, you can press A on
each one of them to change the
form of your Deoxys at any time
you please. The Normal, Defense,
Power, and Speed forms
correspond to each of the four
asteroids in the ground.

North of the fork in the road is
the main entrance to Team
Galactic's massive building.
South is where everything else
is. As you go south, you'll
notice the Casino, called the
Veilstone Game Center, and the
building to the right of it
where you cash in for prizes. In
order to get a Coin Case to make
use of these places, continue
past these places to the end of
the road, and go inside the
house on the farthest right.

Inside is a clown, who asks you
to guess in which of his hands,
which according to him are
behind his back, is a coin. The
answer is random; he changes it.
He'll reward you with some more,
lol, slang ("A winner is you!"),
and the Coin Case, which you can
use to gamble at the Veilstone
Game Corner.

By the way, the left house has a
girl inside that will massage
one of your Pokemon a day, in
order to make them happier with
you. Often you'll get items for
your Fashion Case from the
massaging procedure.

If you continue past these two
houses, you'll meet your friend,
who seems to be worried about
her Pokedex. It really is a
short conversation. Ahead of you
is the Fighting-Type Gym of
Maylene's.

This Gym has a puzzle that isn't
too terribly difficult. However,
due to the nature of the puzzle,
it would be very difficult for
me to explain to you exactly how
to push the sliding wooden
boards in order to get to
Maylene. The idea is to push
them so that entrances open to
you so that you may get to the
Gym leader. Regardless, I can
clue you in on which trainers
that you can't not fight.

The only mandatory fight is the
man in the bottom-right cubicle.
Black Belt Rafael only has a
level 28 Meditite to send out
against you.

While there is only one
mandatory fight, however the guy
directly in front of Maylene is
tough to miss. I suggest that
you don't waste time trying to
dodge him in case you might have
to reenter this Gym too many
times. While you are going to
want to heal right before the
big fight, unfortunately all the
sliding wooden boards reset.
It's a good thing the puzzle
isn't difficult itself.

Black Belt Colby, the one right
in front of Maylene, has three
level 25 Machokes. I hope you've
caught on before now that, and
even the guy standing near the
door told you, that Flying and
Psychic Pokemon are the way to
go.

After you've healed up after
those two or more fights, go
ahead and fight Maylene.

Gym Leader Maylene's Pokemon
are: (1) Meditite: Lv. 27 (2)
Machoke: Lv. 27 (3) Lucario
(with a Sitrus Berry) : Lv. 30

My suggestion is a Flying-Type
for the Meditite, a Phychic-Type
for the Machoke, and a Fire-Type
for the Lucario (as it's a
Fighting/Steel-Type). If you are
having trouble with this fight,
you can walk down Route 214 to
train your Pokemon. By the way,
a Psychic will stop you on your
way out.

When you defeat Maylene and
receive 3600 Pokedollars from
her, you'll receive TM60 (Drain
Punch), and the Cobble Badge,
which enables you to use the
hidden move Fly outside of
battle.

As soon as you leave the Gym,
your friend who was standing
right outside while you fought
will walk up to you and ask for
some help. Apparently, the
reason she was bummed out was
because Team Galactic
accidentally got a hold of her
Pokedex. Help her out and meet
her at the warehouse, which is
immediately above the west
entrance to the city.

Meet your friend near the west
entrance to the city and
together whip the two blocking
your way. As your friend sends
out her level 25 Clefairy, the
first two enemy Pokemon sent out
will be a level 25 Beautifly and
Dustox. A level 25 Stunky
replaces the Beautifly when
defeated. When Dustox goes down,
a level 25 Croagunk replaces it.
If your friend's Clefairy
suffers, she'll replace it with
her own level 25 Kadabra.

After you defeat them, they tell
you that whatever was in that
warehouse was moved to Pastoria
City. HM02 Fly is inside the
warehouse, so go get it. Next up
is the Fourth Gym (Water), which
remarkably takes almost no time
at all to beat, very much unlike
the first three Gyms. The next
thing you do would have been to
head south from Veilstone City
to Route 214, but first you
ought to collect the Marking Map
app from the Poketch company
owner first.


--------------------------------
4) To the Fourth Gym
--------------------------------

    =---------------------------
    =- a. Route 214 and Valor
       Lakefront -=
    =---------------------------

Route 214 is short. In fact,
almost everyone can be skipped
other than the psychic with her
level 22 Ghastly, level 24
Kadabra, and level 23
Misdreavus. However, the large
man in blue is impractical to
continue to skip every time you
pass by Route 214, so I suggest
you beat this collector's three
low-level Roselia at 20, 22, and
24. By the way, there's TM28
(Dig) in the cave to the very
left. Also, the man inside won't
do anything if you show him an
Unown.

In the beginning of Valor
Lakefront, there's not much
other than grass. Make sure you
don't miss that painfully
obvious Paralyze Heal. As you
continue, you'll come across a
woman who has been locked out of
her house. Pass her by for now,
and take a left, since the guy
towards the right says that
there's been a major blackout at
Sunyshore City. At the Seven
Stars Restaurant, you can
partake in no less than five
double battles at your leisure.

Honestly, I've never seen a
Route with this many houses on
it. In fact, Valor Lakefront
together with Route 213 probably
has more houses than some towns!
At the very southwest of Valor
Lakefront, which technically is
Route 213, right under a
swimming pool, is a PP Up. In
fact, opposite at that PP Up is
the Game Director's house! He
tells you to come back when
you've filled up your Pokedex.

Pass these two short areas by
and into Route 213.

    =---------------------------
    =-         b. Route 213     
    =---------------------------

The split-second you cross over
into Route 213, walk into the
left house. Talk to the clown in
the corner and he'll give you
TM92 (Trick Room). Before you
walk into Hotel Grand Lake below
you, pick up the Suite Key on
the left side of the concrete,
two steps away from the
building. Head back to where the
girl was to receive a Lava
Cookie (a nostalgic Full Heal).
When you go back to and enter
the Hotel at Route 213, talk to
the Police Officer so that he'll
heal your Pokemon. Remember to
pick up the Red Shard to the
left as soon as you exit the
building.

When you reach the beach, go
ahead and fight the beach girl's
level 23 Bibarel. There's no
reason to walk through a mostly
peaceful Route 214 and Valor
Lakefront, only to have to dodge
a single person every time you
pass. Continue west for quite a
bit. The first fisherman you see
won't fight you, but the second
one will, though both have their
backs turned.

Don't pass the hut by, as the
guy inside might give your
Pokemon a Footprint Ribbon if
your Pokemon has a "top-quality
footprint". What this means to
you is that if your Pokemon
likes you, he'll give it a silly
Ribbon. Not a bad freebie, in my
opinion. Shortly upward is
Beauty Cyndy with her level 23
Glameow. I wouldn't want to
avoid her either, or at least I
don't want to pass her by and be
surprised. I'm sure you might
feel the same way sometimes.
TM40 (Aerial Ace) is behind the
breakable rock somewhat guarded
by the large man north of it.

This wasn't as short as the
other ones, but it wasn't long
either. Travel north until you
can no longer travel in that
direction and of course move
west from there. You have now
finished the traveling right up
until Pastoria City, home of the
Fourth Gym.

    =---------------------------
    =- c. Pastoria City -=
    =- FOURTH GYM - Leader:
       Crasher Wake -=
    =---------------------------

While this isn't a shrimp town,
there could be bigger cities.
The house immediately below you
as you enter has a green-haired
boy (you had to talk to his
sister in order to tell that the
person was a boy...) inside that
will award you a Ribbon if she
sees the lead Pokemon excelling
in a certain visual attribute,
such as Cute, Cool, Tough, etc.

From the Pokemon Center, two
houses down and one to the right
is the Move Tutor's house. If
you trade him Heart Scales he'll
teach your Pokemon moves. If you
surf east from his house, then
eventually north, you'll find a
Mystic Water, which increases
Water-Type moves by 10%. in a
Pokeball in an alcove. Also, the
house at the west exit has a
woman inside who gives you a
different berry every day you
meet her. She has 17 different
berries that she'll give you,
and after 17 days, she'll
restart her gift-giving cycle
back to the first berry she ever
gave you.

At the Pokemart, Quick Balls are
now sold--perfect for wild Abra.
Not only that, but Great Balls
and Super Repels are sold at
this typical Pokemart. By the
way, when you buy 10 Pokeballs,
you're given a free Premier
Ball. It's not better than a
Pokeball, and does nothing
special. It's free and merely
looks different.

Also here is the Safari Zone!
This time, you're finding
Pokemon in an exotic marsh. You
pay $500 for 500 steps and a
supply of 30 Safari Balls to
capture all the rare Pokemon
with. On the second floor of the
main building is the
observatory, where you pay $100
to take a look out at the Safari
with the Binoculars. Using them,
you can search what Pokemon are
available for capture in the
different areas. This doesn't
guarantee an actual appearance
of the Pokemon you spotted, but
it does give you an idea of
what's available.

The safari swamp is at the very
top of the city, and the moment
you start a $500 session at the
Safari Zone, a green-haired
person on the right will give
you HM05 (Defog). Because there
are almost no areas in the game
where you will need this, I
suggest you don't even teach
this to a single Pokemon. After
you receive this Hidden Machine,
I suggest you simply head to the
Gym if you're not interested in
capturing Pokemon.

There are three mandatory fights
in the Gym. I'll walk you
through the small puzzle first.
Walk forward, then left towards
the stairs. Walk south towards
those stairs and step on the
Orange button, lowering the
water level. Walk down the
nearby two flights of stairs and
move around the other side of
the wall, through the opening in
the right. From here, walk
through the only other opening,
over another set of logs. Travel
up two flights of stairs in
front of you and hit the green
button, raising the water level.
Walk completely around towards
the blue button.

Sailor Damian fights you with
two level 24 Wingulls. Walk
south over the raised logs and
fight Tuber Jacky's level 26
Buizel. East you'll soon fight
Tuber Caitlyn's level 24 Azurill
and Marill. Travel north and hit
the green button. Walk down the
button set of stairs, skipping
the orange button to your left,
and hit the orange button at the
very bottom of the path. Travel
north over three flights of
stairs. Walk all the way around
and, lol at "That's just how I
roll". Anyway, this fool sends
out two level 24 Shellos's, and
a level 24 Wingull. Hit the blue
button and the Gym leader is
yours.

Gym Leader Crasher Wake's
Pokemon are: (1) Gyarados: Lv.
27 (2) Quagsire: Lv. 27 (3)
Floatzel (with a Sitrus Berry):
Lv. 30

I suggest an Electric Pokemon
for the Gyarados and Floatzel,
and a Grass Pokemon for the
Quagsire. The reason I don't
suggest a Grass Pokemon for
Floatzel is because it knows Ice
Fang.

$3600 is your cash reward, as
well as TM55 (Brine). The Fen
Badge allows you to use Defog
outside of battle, as well as
forces all Pokemon level 50 and
below to obey you, which is very
cool.

After him there's not much else
you can do in this town. You can
talk to the Team Galactic member
standing near the swamp safari,
afterwards who runs off. Run
after him and save. Talk to him
again and your rival fights you.
He starts off with a level 26
Starly. He'll change the Pokemon
among his team at any time, of
which includes a level 25
Roselia, a level 25 Buizel, and
an evolved level 28 starter with
the advantage over yours.

You can do a couple things. You
can train at Route 212, which is
something I badly needed to do,
or you can continue to follow
the Grunt to Route 213. I will
spend time in the next sub-
section talking about things
worth mentioning in Route 212.
If you feel powerful enough to
take on Pokemon leveled in their
mid-thirties (what you'll face
in the fifth gym, which takes
almost no time to get to), then
search for "Route 213 and Valor
Lakefront" and skip ahead.

    =---------------------------
    =-         d. Route 212     
    =---------------------------

As you leave Pastoria City,
there's a hidden Full Heal in
the puddle below. When you reach
Route 212, west of Pastoria
City, know that a bicycle cannot
cross the mud up above. You'll
often get stuck in the mud,
although you'll also not find
any Pokemon in it. To get
unstuck, spin your character
around in place. If you enter
the mud from the rightmost edge
as possible and walk two steps
north and one to the east, you
can find a hidden Hyper Potion.

The first person you come across
won't fight you. Any of the
fights here occur during
constant rain, and since the
only reason I'd bother coming
here is to capture Pokemon and
to train, you'll need to
remember that. TM06 (Toxic)
comes up soon after the first
fight.

Before the first fight and
before you collect TM06, you can
see a log extending off of a
raised earth platform guarded by
bushes. First, go under the log
north and collect the Revive.
Once you do actually cross over
the log itself after having cut
down a bush or two, you can
collect an X Special north and
fight someone else. From this
location, you can travel west,
fight a Parasol Lady and collect
a Zinc shortly afterwards.

Eventually, all methods of
travel, either through the mud
or not, leads you to a house
with a trainer in front. In the
house, you can trade the shards
you might have collected along
your adventure in exchange for
Technical Machines. In fact, the
plaque hanging in the back of
the house tells you what TM you
get in exchange for the shards.
The girl on the left also tells
you that you must get ten of
these shards in order to make
the trade.

As you walk left, there are many
more people to fight, and just
about all of them can be
avoided. However, I don't know
why you're here if you're
avoiding fights. TM62 (Silver
Wind) can be collected by riding
over a log (the fact that those
wire-like lines are logs is
confirmed by the scientist near
the log towards the TM). On the
other side of that same platform
(accessed by cutting bushes
north of a bridge below) allows
you to cross other logs. One
takes you to a hidden
TinyMushroom in the bottom-left
corner of the 2x2-sized earth
platform. As you continue west,
the police officer standing
around won't fight you, unless
it's nighttime.

South from him are more battles
and soon a visible Antidote.
While you begin to leave the
area, there is a mandatory
Double Battle against a couple
Rangers. At first an Aipom and
Prinplup both at level 21 are
sent out. Another level 21
Prinplup replaces the first one,
and a level 21 Marill replaces
the Aipom.

As soon as you leave the rain,
there's an Elixir hidden behind
the first signpost you see. TM11
(Sunny Day) in plain view waits
behind some bushes that can be
cut. All around this Pokemon
Mansion are people willing to
fight you. There are also many
more police officers surrounding
the whole campus willing to
fight you only at night.

Once you get into the Mansion,
you can head right and pick up
TM87 (Swagger) from where the
master of the estate stands in a
room. In the rooms to the left,
you can pick up a Burn Heal in
the first room's trashcan. In
the second room to the left, a
woman will give you a Soothe
Bell. As you can plainly see in
the adjoining room to the left,
there is a Great Ball there.

In the garden of the Mansion are
a couple nice Pokemon here and
there. If you come back after
you get the National Pokedex,
return here and talk to the
owner of the Mansion. Say "Yes"
twice in order to listen to him
rant, and he'll mention that he
found a Porygon, which isn't in
the Sinnoh Pokedex. The Butler
will leave the room, so follow
suit. Walk back into the room to
hear that the garden now has a
bunch of Pokemon that weren't
there before. When you're done
training, I suggest you fly back
to Pastoria City, and head to
Route 213 from there.


--------------------------------
5) Before the Fifth Gym
--------------------------------

    =---------------------------
    =- a. Route 213 and Valor
       Lakefront -=
    =---------------------------

When you get to Route 213, go to
the beach and head east. You'll
see that same Grunt again
looking out to the ocean. Talk
to him, and after listening to
him talk to himself, he'll take
notice to you and run away
again. Pass through the entire
beach and head through Hotel
Grand Lake.

As you exit the hotel, you'll
soon hit Valor Lakefront. Take a
right at the Seven Stars
Restaurant, and you'll see the
Grunt once more. Speak to him
and he'll run north. Follow him,
and the next thing he'll do is
fight you when you speak to him
next. Knock his one level 25
Glameow out cold.

That's the last you'll ever see
of him, but regardless head
north and you'll soon see
Cynthia, the one who gave you
HM01 Cut at Eterna City. She'll
ask you if you have seen the
group of Psyduck on Route 210,
which you have. Even if you say
you haven't seen them, she'll
give you this SecretPotion for
them.

Using a Pokemon that can use
HM02 Fly, with this method go to
Solaceon Town, which appears
blue on the map.

    =---------------------------
    =- b. Solaceon Town and
       Route 210 -=
    =---------------------------

Solaceon Town hasn't changed a
bit since you first saw it, so
head immediately north to Route
210.

When you reach Route 210, simply
head north to where the Psyduck
are standing behind the cafe.
Press A on one of them to be
given the option to use the
SecretPotion on them. As soon as
the potion cures their headache,
Cynthia will come from behind
and asks you to deliver an Old
Charm to her grandmother in
Celestic Town.

As you head further into Route
210, you can pick up a Super
Repel off to the left. In the
tall grass, there are three
little kid ninjas who will pop
out of nowhere and fight you. If
you walk straight north through
the brush you are sure to fight
one. If you look closely at the
grass, you can see their small
green hats. The Dowsing Machine
app (a.k.a. Item Finder) can
also locate them for you. A
Hyper Potion is in the middle of
the grass.

Eventually you will run into a
foggy area, which sucks. When
you fight in your battles here,
everyone's Pokemon miss physical
attacks much more often. Moves
that can't miss like Aerial Ace
and non-physical attacks such as
Psybeam are very welcome. Walk
around the right side at first.
Hiding under a green hat is a
ninja, who has two Zubats, a
Golbat, and a Skorupi. Walk west
over the ledge, skipping the
grass. Fight the inevitable
fight with the Ace Trainer and
her level 27 Ponyta and Grotle.
She's not afraid to switch them
out, by the way.

Pass the two people walking
around the elevated ground, as
you have more fights coming up.
Fight the Ace Trainer on the
even higher platform if you
want, but I wanted to preserve
myself. The log (looks like a
wire or rope) to your left can
be ridden over with your
bicycle. While you don't have to
fight the hidden ninja boy to
get to TM30 (Shadow Ball) south
of the next log, you do have to
fight the Karate guy, so make
sure to get your Flying and
Psychic-Type Pokemon ready for
his one level 29 Machoke. Right
before the ground turns green,
walk blindly down the stairs.

A boy to the right down there
guards a Smoke Ball (which when
held by a Pokemon enables the
holder to flee from a wild
battle without fail) with his
level 25 Croagunk and Golbat. To
the left walk into the mandatory
fight with a trainer's level 27
Hoothoot and Noctowl.

Walk north, then west over the
bridge. If you're beat, you can
skip the Veteran above you, who
only guards four berries. I was
in bad shape at this point, so I
simply headed west towards
Celestic Town. By the way, come
back to this route once you have
the ability to use the Hidden
move Waterfall so you can get a
visible Wave Incense and a
hidden Meadow Plate for the
Arceus you don't have.

    =---------------------------
    =- c. Celestic Town -=
    =---------------------------

Thankfully, nothing stands in
your way from immediately
healing at the nearby Pokemon
Center. At the Pokemon Center, a
man to the left will give you a
Great Ball if he sees that your
lead Pokemon likes you.

If you travel west from the
Pokemon Center, an elderly woman
will stop you and speak of an
angry and threatening member of
Team Galactic who stands near
the shrine down from the stairs
above you. Yes, that's Cynthia's
grandmother. Before you deal
with him, check out some other
aspects of this small town.

In the house to the very bottom-
left, a man will give you the
Analog Watch app for your
Poketch. Now you can check the
time with style I guess, as
that's the only reason people
nowadays wear analog watches--
style.

In the very top-left corner of
the town is a house that acts as
a Pokemart. In fact, the house
sells exactly the same stuff,
with the addition of the Timer
Ball, a ball that "becomes
progressively better the more
turns there are in battle". The
man wearing glasses inside this
building will give you
BlackGlasses, which when held by
a Pokemon powers up Dark-Type
moves.

After you've checked all that
there is to see about the town,
and that was it, you can talk to
the Team Galactic member
guarding the entrance to some
ruins. He gives you the option
of kicking his butt or not. His
level 25 Beautifly and level 27
Croagunk isn't anything you
probably haven't dealt with
before. Not only that, this town
isn't foggy like what you used
to deal with not too long ago.

After you win the fight,
Cynthia's grandmother will thank
you and offers for you to check
out the ruins.

Walk inside the Pokemon-free
ruins. Check the painting in the
back of this small room and
Cynthia's grandmother will give
you HM03 (Surf), which opens an
entire new world of places for
you to explore...but not now.
You need the Hearthome Gym Badge
to use it. As soon as you leave
the cave, the man you saw back
in Mt. Coronet right before the
3rd Gym will introduce himself
to you as Cyrus. Apparently he's
the leader of Team Galactic,
with a weird-butt vision of
changing the Pokemon world as
you know it. Cynthia's
grandmother is now in the main
building at the top of the town,
but you can pay her no
attention.

For now, fly to Hearthome City.

    =---------------------------
    =- d. Hearthome City -=
    =- FIFTH GYM - Leader:
       Fantina -=
    =---------------------------

There's not much you can do in
this city that you couldn't do
before, except for fighting
Fantina, user of the Ghost-Type
Pokemon and leader of the fifth
gym you'll face.

When you walk in her Gym, take
the elevator up. You'll come
across a series of puzzles.

The first puzzle says,
"Question: 3 plus 5 plus 7 is?
Answer: <-2 ^16 ->15" The answer
is 15, I hope, so walk through
the door on your right.

What happens if you get it
wrong, you ask? You get to
immediately fight one of that
Gym leader's followers, I
answer. Do you know what else I
say? I say that you need some
training. So, like the girl in
the middle door says, throw the
quiz so you can battle with her,
or anyone else in this Gym you
think you need to level up from.
Hopefully the 8 screw-up trainer
fights will help you get to
where you need to be.

In the room on the right, take
the elevator to get to your next
quiz.

This next puzzle says,
"Question: 12 plus 28 is?
Answer: <-30 ^40 ->50" The
answer to this one better be 40,
so to get close to the Gym
leader take the door in the
middle.

Same as last time go up the slow
elevator and receive your next
quiz. The third quiz asks,
"Question: 3 times 13 is?
Answer: <-39 ^93 ->33". I'm so
glad Pokemon is getting children
to become more familiar with
their times tables and
elementary arithmetic skills. It
might have evidenced the heart
that Nintendo puts into their
games if it wasn't for the fact
that your Poketch also functions
as a calculator. Oh well--left
door.

The final test is "Question: The
first room's answer? Answer: <-2
^16 ->15" Now this one stumped
even me. Luckily, I did the
trial-and-error work for you and
figured out that it is indeed
the right door.

Quack Fantina's Pokemon are: (1)
Drifblim: Lv. 32 (Has a
secondary Flying-Type) (2)
Mismagius (with a Sitrus Berry):
Lv. 36 (Pure Ghost) (3) Gengar:
Lv. 34 (Has a secondary Poison-
Type)

And if you need to return to a
Pokemon Center, I'll list the
Doors for you: 1st Door: ->
(Right) 2nd Door: ^ (Middle) 3rd
Door: <- (Left) 4th Door: ->
(Right)

Know that Normal-Type moves
won't affect any of her Pokemon.
However, some things you
wouldn't think would affect
Ghost-Type Pokemon, such as
Flying-Type moves, do. Take
advantage of the fact that many
Ghost-Type Pokemon have low
Physical Defense, even though
Flying-Type moves are powered
with Physical strength. Of
course, there's the old-
fashioned Psychic-Type way, with
which the Kazza the girl in
Oreburgh City might have traded
for your Machop would work
nicely.

This is a very difficult battle.
Almost anything you throw at
Mismagius can be easily beaten.
It's almost a pure might
struggle here. Fantina will use
a Hyper Potion on any Pokemon
you get into the red health
zone, every time. Because of
this, you need to make sure you
cause her Pokemon to faint from
the yellow zone. If you have
problems matching the levels of
Fantina's Pokemon, I suggest you
go back and fight people in
Route 212 or fight wild Pokemon
in Route 211, which is west of
Celestic Town.

The reward is not enough for
what you had to go through. The
only thing worth mentioning is
that her Relic Badge allows you
to use Surf outside of battle.
You also get a measly 4320
Pokedollars and TM65 (Shadow
Claw) for damaging her Pokemon.

Anyway, as soon as you leave
that wretched Gym, Cynthia finds
you and suggests that you should
check out the library at
Canalave City. With no time to
lose, shine your Relic Badge in
your Trainer Card--you don't
dare let _this_ one dull after
dealing with a Gym like that.
Now that you're done here, fly
over to Jubilife City, from
where you will Surf west to
Canalave City.


--------------------------------
6) Collecting the Sixth Badge
--------------------------------

    =---------------------------
    =- a. Jubilife City and
       Route 218 -=
    =---------------------------

When you arrive at Jublife City,
head to the Poketch Headquarters
at the northwestern part of the
city, and receive the Link
Searcher from the President now
that you have five badges. He
also tells you that you will
probably get another when you
get your Seventh Badge. Also, if
you ever forget how to use one
of your Poketch applications,
you can head to the third floor
of the Poketch Company building
and check the computers to learn
how to use each one. For now,
let's just focus on the sixth
gym badge and leave this place
to the west.

As soon as you get to Route 218,
surf north around the trees and
grab a Rare Candy from the
northeast corner. Notice the
whole new set of wild Pokemon
you'll be encountering in the
water. Take the north path above
the rocks if you don't want to
fight anyone. If you take the
southern path, you will
eventually have to fight a
Guitarist with his level 31
Luxio, even if you skip the two
fishermen. Oh, and did anyone
else catch the "fishing is for
the win" from the fisherman on
the bottom? XD

Passing this route, you'll reach
Canalave City almost
immediately. As soon as you
reach the building that connects
the two places, your friend's
father (also Professor Rowan's
assistant) will stop you and
upgrade your Pokedex. Now your
Pokedex can display the
differences between how male and
female Pokemon look. When he
leaves, notice the policeman at
the top of this room saying he's
thirsty. However, none of the
game's four drinks (Bottled
Water, Soda Pop, Lemonade, or
Moomoo Milk) will satisfy him,
which is somewhat of a
disappointment, as such a thing
uncharacteristically contrasts
previous Pokemon games.

    =---------------------------
    =- b. Canalave City -=
    =- SIXTH GYM - Leader: Byron
       -=
    =---------------------------

Don't become distracted by the
beauty of this city. Be very
aware that as soon as you cross
the bridge your rival will fight
you. Heal at a Pokemon Center
and save before you deal with
him.

In the very first house you see
when entering from the east, a
girl to the right in this
building will give you TM48
(Skill Swap). Above this house
is the Pokemart, where there is
a plethora of new items being
sold. The Repeat Ball, Ultra
Ball, Hyper Potion, and Max
Repel are now sold here. In the
house right above the Pokemart
is where the Move Deleter
resides.

Above the last house is the
bridge, Pokemon Center, and an
old hotel. The girl on the left
in the Pokemon Center tells you
she got the Hidden Machine
Strength in the Lost Tower on
Route 209, a tower I told you to
avoid when you first passed it.
In the old hotel is where you
begin a quest to capture the
rare Pokemon Darkrai, but you
cannot begin that quest without
the Membership Card key item,
which can only be obtained
through a special promotional
event of the kind that Nintendo
tends to hold in Japan only. It
looks like you're out of luck,
unless you have a friend with or
you yourself have an Action
Replay device from Datel
Electronics.

Time to fight your rival. From
the concrete, one step onto the
wooden bridge and two more after
that makes three steps before
your rival stops you for a
challenge. He starts off with
his level 31 Staravia.
Following, he will send in a
level 35 evolved starter (or
fully evolved if you chose
Prinplup as your starter) that
has the elemental advantage over
your starter. Afterwards he will
send in a level 30 Heracross
(Bug-Type), and then a level 32
Buizel. Lastly you will fight
his level 32 Roselia. I honestly
can't imagine anyone having
trouble with him if you have
recently beaten Fantina. $3500
is your reward.

As you can see, this city
somewhat would have been a dead
end if it wasn't for the dock,
accessible from the southwestern
part of city. As soon as you
feel like it, the sea captain is
willing to take you to Iron
Island. After you take care of
the Gym, I'll cover the library
and then getting the HM
Strength.

Because you at least have the
fourth Gym Badge, and because of
that can control all Pokemon up
to level 50, there's no reason
not to fight anyone in this Gym.
Not only that, the moment you
beat this gym, you'll be able to
control all Pokemon up to level
70, which is light-years away
from where you are now.

In this Gym, Steel Pokemon are
used, so get used to using your
Fighting, Ground, and Fire-
Types. While Water and Electric-
Type moves aren't super
effective, they're the only
other two moves that aren't "not
very effective", and Poison-Type
moves don't affect Steel-Type
Pokemon at tall. Steel Pokemon
are pretty much what the old,
old-gen Ghost and Rock/Ground
Pokemon used to be--those immune
to the typical stuff, except
Steel are immune to a tad more
than them.

The first obvious fight is
against Black Belt Ricky's one
level 33 Steelix. If you have a
well-balanced team, his Steel-
Type shouldn't give you too many
problems. While the next fight
off to the right on this very
floor (the colored platforms are
super-elevators) may not be
mandatory, it's one of those
that'd be annoying to skip every
time. I suggest that you fight
Worker Gary's one level 31 Onix,
not only out of convenience but
also so that your Pokemon don't
fall behind in level. Out of the
four elevators, take the one on
the very far right.

When you reach the next level,
take the next one down. This
next mandatory fight against Ace
Trainer Cesar (who said
"noob"...) starts off with you
against his level 30 Skorupi
(which is a Poison/Bug-Type?).
He next sends out a level 32
Steelix. From here is pretty
much a straightforward until it
splits into two paths. Of the
two moving platforms, with one
going up and the other going
right, take the one going up.
Don't take the next one you see,
as the one guarded by Worker
Gerardo's two level 29 Onix's is
the one you want to take.

Go ahead and walk right into a
fight with Black Belt David's
level 30 Onix and level 32
Steelix. Take the U-turn of
platforms to the south, and then
descend. Ace Trainer Breanna has
one level 33 Azumarill (Water-
Type?). You'll eventually come
across the red platform that
takes you straight to Byron.

Gym Leader Byron's Pokemon are:
(1) Bronzor: Lv. 36 (With
secondary Psychic-Type) (2)
Bastiodon: Lv. 39 (With
secondary Rock-Type) (3)
Steelix: Lv. 36

Only until after I met Byron did
I learn that Roark was a boy (I
also modified this guide's usage
of pronouns when I found out).
Roark is this guy's son. Now
normally I'd start off using
Fighting-Type moves if it wasn't
for the fact that they will only
do 1x the amount of damage to
it. Only Fire-Type moves are
super effective against it.
Because Byron also uses Hyper
Potions like nobodies' business,
I used a slightly weaker Fire
move to lower its HP to the
point where one more-powerful
Fire move would kill it without
fear of it being healed first.

Bastiodon will use Flash Cannon,
which is a Steel-Type
move...which did 5 Hit Points of
damage to my level 37 Empoleon.
Make sure you're prepared
against that. His Steelix isn't
anything special that you
haven't dealt with before, so
after his Bastiodon, you won't
have to worry about a thing.

Take his 4680 Pokedollars, TM91
(Flash Cannon), and his Mine
Badge. With the Mine Badge, you
can use the hidden move Strength
outside of battle (when you get
it very soon) and now all
Pokemon up to level 70 will
"obey you without question",
which is nice. From where he is,
take the right moving platform
and hold that route until you
reach the very bottom. Now you
can leave without dealing with
his Gym's silly maze.

As soon as you leave the Gym,
your rival will congratulate
you. He asks you to follow him
into the library, so do so.
Nothing occurs on the first two
floors of the library. On the
third, your rival will seat you
down next to your mentor buddy
and Professor Rowan. Now I
really do enjoy this. This game
truly does incorporate more
story than the previous Pokemon
games. Professor Rowan talks of
the Mirage Legendaries (this
game's legendary triplet) and
sends your mentor buddy to Lake
Verity, your rival to Lake
Acuity, and you to Lake Valor.

Suddenly an earthquake occurs.
Before you leave, remember that
only on this third floor can you
read any of the books, and every
bookshelf has a book that you
can read. You can now leave the
library. Once you get outside, a
sailor tells your group that an
explosion came from Lake Valor--
where you were supposed to go,
and where two mysterious men
guarded the actual lake.

There are quite a few things
that you can do now. You can fly
to Solaceon Town, traveling
south to reach the Lost Tower on
Route 209 for the Hidden Machine
Strength. You can fly to
Veilstone City, where you can
head straight to Pastoria City
to get to Lake Valor--you have
less wild Pokemon to deal with
if you approach Lake Valor from
Pastoria City, as opposed to
Veilstone City.

Because you don't want to get
behind in your side-quests, let
us first collect Strength from
the Lost Tower, south of
Solaceon Town on Route 209.


--------------------------------
7) Preceding the Seventh Gym
--------------------------------

    =---------------------------
    =- a. Route 209 and the Lost
       Tower -=
    =---------------------------

When you fly to Solaceon Town,
immediately head south and
straight into the Lost Tower.

The first floor is fairly empty.
You will come across many Ghost-
Type Pokemon of a level much
lower than yours. The only
reason I have only mentioned
this place now is because that
without the sixth badge,
Strength is useless. In
addition, you've probably seen
only one or two times in which
you could have used it.

On the second floor, I suggest
you fight Youngster Oliver's
pathetic team of a level 16
Stunky, Shellos, and Kricketune.
No--it wasn't for the Oval Stone
that he "guards", but for the
added convenience.

On the third floor, you're
forced to fight Roughneck
Kirby's one level 19 Cleffa.
Behind him is a Revive. You can
walk around the next loser.

On this next floor, you're going
to have to fight someone, so I
suggest the Young Couple Mike &
Nat who has one pair of level 19
Murkrow and Misdreavus. TM27
(Return) is the Pokeball you see
towards the bottom of the
screen.

On the last floor, the woman on
the right will give you a
Cleanse Tag, which reduces the
amount of wild Pokemon
encountered if held by your lead
Pokemon. The woman on the left
will give you HM04 (Strength),
so now that you're done, leave
this place. Unfortunately, an
Escape Rope won't make that
process any faster.

Next, all you have to do is fly
to either Pastoria or Veilstone
City. My suggestion is, again,
Pastoria, as there are less wild
Pokemon battles before you reach
the actual lake. Regardless of
the city that you fly to, from
them head to the Valor
Lakefront.

    =---------------------------
    =- b. Valor Lakefront -=
    =---------------------------

When you get to Valor Lakefront,
head west through the forest on
a path that used to be blocked
by two men. When you get there,
it'll look like the whole lake
was blown up. The first person
you see won't fight you, but the
next person you see will fight
you no matter what. She sends
out a level 33 Glameow first and
Croagunk second. Only three of
the six Team Galactic members
will fight you outside, but that
was the only mandatory fight.
South of where you entered the
lake there is a cave. Go inside.

In the cavern you will see
Commander Saturn. Save before
you talk to him. He first sends
out a level 35 Kadabra. Next
he'll send out a level 35
Bronzor. Lastly he'll throw a
level 37 Toxicroak
(Poison/Fighting-Type) holding a
Sitrus Berry at you. After you
take his 2960 Pokedollars, he'll
leave. As you walk back outside,
you might notice that every one
of the three that wouldn't fight
you before have left along with
him. When you talk to one of the
two that you didn't have to
fight before (providing that you
beat him), he mentions that Team
Galactic is probably conducting
its business near Twinleaf Town
--your town. Let's see if we can
do anything about that.

    =---------------------------
    =- c. Twinleaf Town and
       Verity Lakefront -=
    =---------------------------

When you reach your hometown,
immediately head northwest into
the Lake area. When you arrive,
you'll see Professor Rowan, who
was talking with a Team Galactic
member. There are two double
battles here, and you have to
deal with both of them.

Starting off with the first two
Grunts, the first pair of
Pokemon thrown at you are a
level 33 Glameow and level 32
Silcoon. A level 32 Golbat
replaces the Silcoon, and a
level 32 Glameow replaces the
first one.

In the second fight, the first
two Pokemon sent out are a level
32 Stunky and level 31
Beautifly. A level 33 Glameow
replaces the Beautifly, and a
level 32 Glameow replaces the
Stunky.

Walking near your friend and
Commander Mars will not
automatically activate an
encounter. Instead, save
beforehand you talk to Commander
Mars, and you'll fight him
again! He'll start off the fight
with a level 37 Golbat. Next up
comes his level 39 Purugly. This
Purugly is fond of putting you
to sleep with Hypnosis. Lastly,
he will send out his level 37
Bronzor (w/ Levitate). Take his
3120 Pokedollars.

After the fight, Commander Mars
will tell you that at Team
Galactic's headquarters is the
captured Mesprit, "the Being of
Emotion", Azelf, "the Being of
Willpower", and Uxie, "the Being
of Intelligence." When he's done
and gone, Professor Rowan will
ask you to go to Lake Acuity and
find out if your rival is okay.
Before you do, surf southwest
across the lake to pick up TM38
(Fire Blast).

Head to Celestic Town and then
go west across Route 211. But
before you do, I highly suggest
you heal and stock_up on
supplies. Now it's time to use
up some money.

    =---------------------------
    =- d. Route 211 and Mt.
       Coronet -=
    =---------------------------

West of Celestic Town is Route
211. There are a couple fights
although not one of them is
necessary to cross. However, if
you talk to the person looking
out towards the grass, you'll be
given TM77 (Psych Up). When you
have Rock Climb and Rock Smash,
you can come here for TM29
(Psychic).

When you get into the actual
Mountain, remember that you're
trying to head north.
Immediately move the boulder
above you out of your way with a
Pokemon using Strength so that
you can pass. Before you go down
the slope, break the rocks up to
your left to reach a Rare Candy.
When you take a left turn after
you go down the slope, you'll
reach a new, foggy place. Only
now do the wild Pokemon
encounters become more powerful.

When you reach the foggy area,
go ahead and pick up the
Stardust behind the breakable
rock. If you want, you can
completely skip this entire area
and head north on one path to
reach an ascending slope to the
right. However, you would be
missing many items. A Revive is
behind a moveable stone towards
the upper- middle part of that
foggy area. If you pass where
the Revive is and break one rock
up, you'll pick up a Full
Restore--very nice. Close near
the water towards the upper-
right part of the area, there is
a Max Elixir. Some Light Clay is
in the middle of the body of
water on a small 2x2 platform of
land. Some Soft Sand is on one
ledge lower than and to the
right of the main pathway.

When you come out of the foggy
area from the ascending slope,
you can simply walk around until
you reach outside to Route 216.

    =---------------------------
    =- e. Routes 216-217 -=
    =---------------------------

Now this is one good-looking
place to travel in. First of
all, where two bridges run
across the higher section of
this area, in the top-left
corner is an Ice Heal. I'm sure
you've also noticed by now how
you slow down in the snow--
there's nothing you can do about
that.

Up above, if you've taken one
bridge north to where the Ice
Heal was, take the other bridge
south to where Ace Trainer Laura
will fight you with her one
level 37 Lopunny. By now you
should also have noticed that
Hail during battles will buffet
any Pokemon that isn't of the
Ice-Type. If you didn't take the
higher path, which I suggest
because there are no random
battles in the Hail, it doesn't
matter much because both wind up
in the same place. Personally, I
fought as many people as I
possibly could, not because I'm
an idiot and want to take an
early trip back to the Pokemon
Center, but because the next Gym
is in Snowpoint City, which is
immediately east of the Acuity
Lakefront.

Besides, very soon is a lodge
where you can heal up, as well
as the fact that you should
always fight absolutely everyone
not worth dodging in the future.
Walk into the lodge and fall
asleep in the bed. When you're
done, fight the Skier right
outside, heal again, and save.
From there, walk north into
Route
217. When you return with Rock
     Climb, remember that there
     is TM13 (Ice Beam) at
the end of a path past many
trainers.

When you reach Route 217, you'll
soon notice that it is hailing
like mad here. As you walk
north, you'll run into a
mandatory fight with Ace Trainer
Dalton, who first throws a level
34 Raichu at you. Next up comes
his level 38 Hippopotas (Ground-
Type), who changes the Hail up
into a Sandstorm. His final
Pokemon is a level 36 Pelipper.

Luckily there are no random
battles here, because the
trainers themselves are good
enough for you or me. If you see
what you think might be an item
Pokeball in the middle of
nowhere, sometimes it might be a
Ninja. Now there is one Iron out
there, but you should really
make sure before you check. Last
time I fought everyone merely
because there was a lodge up
ahead--now it's perseverance.

Funny enough, TM07 (Hail) is
southeast of a house that's near
the left of the route. In that
house is a man who said he
dropped his Hidden Machine Rock
Climb in the snow. Do you know
what that means? Pick up this
HM08 (Rock Climb) that's _right_
outside his house, to the
northeast. Go back inside and
talk to him to receive an Icicle
Plate for the Arceus you don't
have. As you continue up this
route, watch out for crazy,
spinning trainers. I suggest
you, after receiving the HM, go
immediately across the snowfield
to the right. Hug the walls and
you'll find another house. The
girl inside will give you a
Spell Tag, which intensifies
Ghost-Type moves when held by a
Pokemon.

You'll notice that after the
house is a rock and a dead end.
If you have an Eevee and level
it up when near that rock, it
will evolve into a Glaceon.
Unfortunately, you'll have to
take the time to walk all the
way back over to the left. Black
Belt Luke up ahead is almost
impossible to miss. He doesn't
have anything you haven't
handled before, however.
Unluckily, he wasn't the last of
this Route. Coming up soon is
Lake Acuity, but before that,
you'll have to fight Ace Trainer
Olivia's level 37 Roselia and
Seaking.

When you cross the first patch
of grass after Olivia, you'll
run into Lake Acuity, with a
not-so-severe hail.

    =---------------------------
    =- f. Acuity Lakefront -=
    =---------------------------

Almost as soon as you reach this
place, the path decidedly
splits. You can either talk to
the two Team Galactic Grunts
guarding the actual Lake, or you
can head east to Snowpoint City.
You'll reach Snowpoint City soon
enough, so for now, help out
your buddy like you originally
intended to...or not. They won't
fight you--they're there to keep
out Snowpoint City's Gym leader,
not you. Unfortunately, you'll
have to hold off dealing with
Team Galactic and find the Gym
leader; don't they tend to hang
around in Gyms?

Along the way as you walk east,
towards the top of a grove is an
Ultra Ball. There is a lot of
grass for wild Pokemon to bother
you in, so continue the annoying
path east. Luckily, this is a
short route.

    =---------------------------
    =- g. Snowpoint City -=
    =- SEVENTH GYM - Leader:
       Candice -=
    =---------------------------

Upon reaching this place, you'll
notice another dock--this dock
takes you to the three special
areas on a massive island in the
northeast part of the Sinnoh
region. You can only make use of
this guy's boat once you've
become the region's Champion.

The Sailor near the Pokemon
Center says that there's nothing
much to do around here. He's
right. In fact, apart from the
Gym and the Temple in the back,
there's only one thing you can
do. In the northwest house, a
girl is willing to trade you a
Haunter in exchange for a
Medicham (which could be caught
in the previous Routes), and
that's it. That's the town.

What makes the Pokemart unique
is its Snow Mail...yeah, let's
heal at the Pokemon Center and
get the next badge.

This next Gym just looks
annoying, and it is. Basically,
you have to run into the balls
of ice at high speeds in order
to break them. Not all fights
are mandatory in this place, but
they might as well be, seeing as
you're going to have to run all
over the place every time you
reenter this place.

Go ahead and get all fights out
of your way. Aimlessly go all
over the place and fight as many
people as you can--I'll walk you
through the puzzle once you've
fought everyone, healed, and
returned. Because of such a
difficult task, you will need to
understand that people here will
never ever run up to you and
fight. People will only fight
you if the other person and you
meet face to face--another
annoying slow-down to this
process.

Ace Trainer Isaiah's one level
39 Quagsire is one mandatory
fight--he's to the right of the
inner circle. One the left of
the middle circle is Ace Trainer
Brenna with her one level 39
Snover (Grass/Ice-Type). To the
very bottom-left of the Gym is
Ace Trainer Sergio, with his
level 37 Floatzel and Sneasel.
In the top-right corner, there
is a hidden snow pad right above
Ace Trainer Savannah, with her
level 35 Pelipper, level 37
Steelix, and level 36 Golduck.
Walk left from Savannah to reach
the near-last trainer.

In the upper-left corner, Ace
Trainer Allicia sends out a
level 37 Sneasel and then a
similarly leveled Tentacruel.
The trainer north of Savannah
and nearest to Candice, Ace
Trainer Anton, has one level 39
Snover to throw at you.

Now get out of here and heal. Up
next is my D-Pad-pressing guide
to reach her, and then my
commentary on Candice herself.

When you get back, just one
space to the left of the wooden
stairs straight in front of you,
run north while sliding into two
ice balls.

Go back to the entrance and do
the exact same thing on the
other side of the wooden stairs
immediately in front of the
entrance, breaking three more
obstacles.

From here, slide to the right
and the north to the corner.
There are two snow pads to your
left. Slide over to them, and
then walk over to on top of the
left one.

Slide down until you reach
another snow pad, then slide
left into another obstacle.

From there, continue to slide
west and south alternatively
until you reach a padding of
snow just southeast of Ace
Trainer Sergio.

From there, slide north, then
west into a wall, then north
again onto another padding of
snow.

Slide to the right onto a hidden
snow pad, then one more time to
break the snowball down below.
Now go in a south, west, and
south alternating pattern until
you're southeast of Ace Trainer
Sergio again.

From the pad of snow, go up once
onto another pad, and then north
again until you hit an ice
obstacle. Next, slide right.
From here, return to the
entrance (by heading towards
Sergio).

At the entrance, slide the very
same direction you went the
first time you went anywhere.
Slide west into Ace Trainer
Allicia, then all around her
until you hit the ice obstacle
on the very left. Slide right
into another snowball. Return to
the entrance, Sergio style.

From the entrance's big padding
of snow, slide into the snowball
to the very bottom-right. Travel
north, then north again until
you're on the bottom of two pads
of snow, side-by-side. Travel
west to break another snowball.

In the very same direction you
traveled the very first time you
went anywhere, one step left of
the wooden stairs north of the
entrance, travel north. Slide
west into Ace Trainer Allicia,
then south, then east.

Return to the entrance Sergio-
style and face the Gym leader.

Gym Leader Candice's Pokemon
are: (1) Snover: Lv. 38
(Ice/Grass-Type) (2) Sneasel:
Lv. 38 (Dark/Ice-Type) (3)
Medicham: Lv. 40
(Fighting/Psychic-Type) (4)
Abomasnow (w/ Sitrus Berry): Lv.
42 (Ice/Grass-Type)

I hope you came well prepared
for this fight, because I know
that I never want to do any of
that again. Fighting and Flying-
Type moves work very well
against Snover. I used Fire-Type
moves against Sneasel.
Personally, with a level 41
Staraptor and Infernape, the
first two went down in one hit
each.

The next one is an oddball.
However, Flying and Ghost-Type
moves are what work really well
against it. It's immune to
nothing, and only Fighting and
Rock-Type moves' power is
halved. I went back to my
Staraptor with this one. With
the assistance of the hail,
Medicham went out in one turn.

Abomasnow is the evolved form of
Snover. I didn't use the same
thing I used for Snover, because
Candice is keen on using Full
Restores on her Abomasnow, even
if it isn't in red health. I
took it out in one hit with what
I used on Sneasel (Fire-Type).

As you might tell, I would have
difficulty in understanding why
anyone would have any trouble
with her. If you have a
scenario, which you think may
make it harder for some people,
tell me the plight and I'll be
more than happy to guide those
people in a paragraph replacing
this one.

Take this girl's petty cash of
5040 Pokedollars, your TM72
(Avalanche), and her Icicle
Badge, which enables the use of
Rock Climb outside of battle.

Now that you're done here (she
won't talk to you about the Lake
yet), go heal at a Pokemon
Center. Before you head west
towards the Acuity Lakefront,
fly to Jubilife City (now that
you have seven badges), and
receive the Move Tester app for
your Poketch. Fly back and head
west towards the lake.


--------------------------------
8) For the Final Badge
--------------------------------

    =---------------------------
    =- a. Acuity Lakefront -=
    =---------------------------

When you reach the entrance to
the Lake, you'll notice that the
two Grunts have split up to
either side of the entrance.
They won't fight you, so you can
assume that someone already has.
Obviously your rival blew them
out of the way, because now he's
backed up Commander Jupiter into
a corner. When everything has
been taken care of, you can pick
up TM14 (Blizzard) at the very
top-right part of the lake.
Notice that the grass around the
Technical Machine is pretty much
the only place where you can
fight that area's Pokemon
without it hailing.

This didn't take too long
unfortunately (adding story to
the Pokemon games can only be a
good thing), so now the only
place you have left to go is to
where Team Galactic HQ is,
Veilstone City.

    =---------------------------
    =- b. Veilstone City -=
    =---------------------------

If you haven't noticed already,
you can travel to new places
with Rock Climb. You can pick up
a Full Incense (I've no idea
what it does) to the left of the
Pokemon Center. Now that you got
that, it's time to head to Team
Galactic's Headquarter, at the
northeastern part of the city.

When you arrive on the premises,
you might notice the Grunt that
wasn't standing there before.
Talk to him and he'll run away,
leaving behind a Storage Key.
From the looks of things around
this joint, you'll have to
infiltrate the base indirectly.
While it probably wouldn't have
been a problem to simply fight
your way past every single one
of those suckas, you can't fight
your way through their steel
doors.

Because you can't waltz right in
and take over their operations,
head over to where you helped
your friend retrieve his or her
Pokedex, near the storage
facility. With the Storage Key,
walk right past the guy
"guarding" the door, picking up
the obvious Dusk Stone on your
way downstairs.

The scientist won't fight you,
but the Galactic member down
towards the right sure will. You
don't have to fight him, but
he's also placed inconveniently
in your way. Besides, he only
has one level 37 Golbat. As you
pass him, go ahead and pick up
the Zinc. This next guy you
can't dodge. Apparently, you're
the first intruder ever in their
building, but with that intruder
being you, they better hope they
don't get another. He has a
level 35 Dustox and Bronzor.
Prove to him you're bored of his
too-common choice of Pokemon.
From there, go ahead and head
upstairs.

The oddly placed guy in this
room won't fight you nor tell or
give anything of use to you. On
the next floor, however, you
will have to deal with one
Grunt's level 37 Glameow. When
you arrive at two warp panels,
the right one will take you to
TM49 (Snatch), while the other
will have you progress further
in their base, to the room on
the left.

In that room on the left,
obviously take the only other
warp. From this room, take the
stairs up. In here, the warp on
the left _eventually_ takes you
to the exit, while giving you
the opportunity to pick up TM36
(Sludge Bomb) and this "Galactic
Key" along the way. The right
path leads you to TM21
(Frustration), but you need the
Galactic Key first. No matter
what you want to do, go to the
warp. On the way down, there is
a scientist with two Kadabras,
but you don't have to fight him.
The Grunt past him won't fight
you, so pick up Sludge Bomb and
the Galactic Key.

If you really want TM21, you
will have to fight the Galactic
member in between the two
staircases with the warp you
took. He has a level 32 Wurmple,
a level 36 Dustox, and a level
34 Cascoon. On the floor above
him, the guy looking away won't
do anything, but the guy down
the hall will fight you with his
one level 37 Stunky. The next
guy running up and down the
halls looking almost every which
way is fun to dodge. I did it
both times I passed him. Use the
Galactic Key on the door to get
TM21 (Frustration) in the
adjoining room.

Do you know what there's left to
do here? Nothing. With the
Galactic Key, apparently you
_can_ waltz right into the main
entrance of their headquarters.
Exit this place through the warp
since you've collected
everything. As you come near the
exit, use the Galactic Key to
open the door.

After you heal at the Pokemon
Center, go to the main entrance
of their base. Take the left or
middle door and use the Galactic
Key to continue to the next
floor.

What comes next is rather
interesting. You have the option
of taking on two Grunts
separately, or together. If you
want to fight each one
individually, fight the first
Grunt when he's looking up, and
then the next as she looks left.
If you want to fight them at the
same time, pass the guy on the
left as he looks right, then
come into the view of both of
them when that guy on the left
continues to look right (he'll
face either north or east). Both
of them first send out two level
36 Golbats. The female Golbat is
replaced by level 34 Silcoon,
and the male Golbat is replaced
with another just like it.

As you continue, know that
bothering the scientist will
result in a battle. Off to the
right, taking the warp at the
top takes you to a purposeless
room, while the warp on the
bottom eventually takes you to
the Max Revive on the other
side. Obviously, only the warp
near the scientist takes you
anywhere.

In the room that you are taken
to by that warp, you have the
opportunity to rest and heal up.
By taking the stairs, you soon
wind up in a double battle. The
first pair of enemy Pokemon is a
level 36 Stunky and level 35
Croagunk. A level 36 Croagunk
replaces the Stunky, and a level
35 Stunky replaces the first
Croagunk. Lastly, you'll face a
level 35 Glameow.

Eventually you'll come upon
three warps. The upper-left one
merely takes you to one Elixir.
The upper-right warp takes you
nowhere, so that leaves the
bottom- left one as the warp you
want to take. When you arrive in
the room that warp takes you,
ascend the staircase.

Here is the very last room of
Team Galactic's HQ. I suggest
you heal (at the beds) and save.
As soon as you walk into the
room, Galactic Boss Cyrus will
start a fight with you. He'll
first throw a level 40 Murkrow
(Dark/Flying-Type) at you. Note
that Cyrus will use Super
Potions often. After the Murkrow
will come his level 40 Golbat
(Poison/Flying-Type). Lastly,
he'll use his level 43 Sneasel
(Dark/Ice-Type). When you win
the fight, he'll honor your
power by giving you a Master
Ball.

Take the man's suggestion and
leave by the warp.
Unfortunately, you'll have one
more major fight up ahead.
Neither of the scientists in the
next room will fight you, but
talk to Commander Saturn in the
room afterwards to start another
battle. He'll first send his
level 38 Kadabra. Next up is his
level 38 Bronzor. The last
Pokemon you have to fight at the
Team Galactic HQ is Saturn's
level 40 Toxicroak
(Poison/Fighting-Type).

Take Saturn's advice (did you
have a choice?) and press the
button on the consol.
Apparently, Cyrus has gone and
shackled something in chains on
Mt. Coronet. As you take the
yellow warp out of there, you'll
notice that the path to the
green warp has been cleared,
allowing you to leave. Don't
forget to pick up the PP Up on
the left side of the building
after you leave.

The Coronet Mountain is
obviously the next place you
need to go. However, there are
multiple entrances to it. The
way you want to enter that will
allow you to progress in the
game's story is traveling west
from Hearthome City.

    =---------------------------
    =- c. Hearthome City and
       Route 208 -=
    =---------------------------

Before you head straight into
the mountain, know that a very
pivotal point will occur in the
game. In fact, up ahead is
pretty much the ending of the
game's plot. After this, only
the Eighth Badge and the Elite
Four will be in between you and
the game's end. Because of this,
head to the Pokemart and prepare
yourself (make sure you carry
two Pokemon Center trips-worth
of supplies) for one long
journey ahead. In addition to
many healing items, buy many
higher-end Repels and many, many
Dusk Balls. Dusk Balls, when
used in dark places and at
nighttime, have the highest
chance of capture over all other
conventional Pokeballs, at 4x
(Ultra Balls are at 2x). Oh, and
get an Escape Rope.

Don't bother healing now if you
haven't taken care of everyone
at Route 208. If you think that
absolutely no one will stand in
between you and Mt. Coronet, go
ahead and heal and head that
direction. If not, don't bother
and beat all the trainers that
might needlessly hurt your
Pokemon before you take
one_big_trip into the mountain.

Once you've cleared every
trainer that might get in your
way, heal and then head straight
to Mt. Coronet, past Route 208.
Use normal repels over the grass
in Route 208, and then once you
get into Mt. Coronet yourself,
begin to use your Super and Max
Repels. Wild Pokemon should be
the last thing to waste your
time and Pokemon's health.

    =---------------------------
    =- d. Mt. Coronet and Spear
       Pillar -=
    =---------------------------

When you arrive in Mt. Coronet
(the part where you start using
Super and Max Repels), either by
breaking the rocks below or by
running around over the ramps,
move towards the left. You can
if you like, now that you can
surf, pick up the Dawn Stone at
the very bottom of the cave. In
this room, move all the way
around to the very top-left
part, past the exit on the left.
Surf right across the small
expanse of water. Pick up the
obvious Protein. When you get to
the very right, carefully walk
along the edge and rock climb to
the next area.

Walk the only way you can in the
next place, picking up the
obvious Max Potion and the not-
so-obvious Ether hiding at the
stone on that same elevation.
When you have the option of
traveling further, instead head
down to collect an Escape Rope.
TM80 (Rock Slide) is in this
convoluted area in addition to a
Revive. I'm not going to give
directions in this silly room,
but I will tell you that you
want to leave this room by the
dark opening in the upper-left,
and not the exit to the bottom-
left.

When you go into the next room,
walk up the obvious staircase.
After you reach the next room,
head immediately to the stairs
on the other side, picking up a
hidden Max Revive in this dead-
end room. Of course return to
the three-way room.

In the three-way room, a Grunt
that's difficult to dodge has
one level 40 Beautifly. I
suggest you dodge her unless you
think you can act first and end
the match in one move. Further
in this room is a guy who's
actually not that hard to dodge,
believe it or not. Basically, he
only looks up or down--not left
or right. Run around the first
rock when he's on the left, and
then pass the next rock also
when he's on the left. Only move
to in front of the door when
he's out of sight. Walk outside
afterwards.

When you come outside, you can
stop using your Super Repels and
switch to the normal Repels as
you walk through the grass--your
job right now is preservation.
In the first patch of grass is a
hidden Full Heal. After you
climb one set of rocks (climbing
the second set will only net you
one hidden Nugget), walk south-
west, moving stones to avoid the
massive patch of grass and break
the rock at the very bottom-left
to pick up a hidden Max Potion.

In the entrance to the mountain
on the very right, there is a
hidden Ultra Ball up a big ramp
going up. However, continuing
this way does you no good, as
you cannot climb waterfalls, not
having the Hidden Machine or the
Eighth Badge. Because of this,
you might as well exit and head
for the other entrance to the
same place from the far left--
which requires no Repels to get
to.

When you re-enter from the left,
use a Super Repel and run up to
climb the wall. The Grunt only
looks left, even though he will
battle you. The next Grunt isn't
so easy to dodge, although it's
not that difficult. You can pick
up an obvious, though hidden
Escape Rope at the rock below on
your way out.

When you go outside, know that
there's no reason for you to
walk into the big expanse of
linear grass unless you're dying
for a Rare Candy. Outside, the
only other thing of use to you
is a hidden Big Mushroom,
towards the very bottom, which
is also the very northern-most
part of the downgrade. There are
two more entrances into the
mountain--you want to go up, so
walk all around towards the left
to continue to the insides.

In the next room there's
nothing, so continue up the
stairs. South and above is an
inevitable fight with this Grunt
and her level 38 Bronzor and
Glameow. Hidden on a rock
directly below that fight is a
Stardust. Unfortunately, you'll
have to fight one more Grunt,
with his level 37 Bronzor and
Golbat. Head up the stairs.

I tell you what--Game Freak
hates you. In the biggest battle
of preservation ever, they throw
_another_ mandatory Grunt fight
at you in this next room. She
starts off with her level 37
Golbat. If you have an unhealthy
habit of raising your Pokemon
perfectly equal like me, forget
about it for now--at this point
only use what works best. You
fight a level 37 Glameow
followed by a level 37 Bronzor,
after which the fight ends.
Anyway, I must say--isn't this
room foreboding or what? Check
out the design. You don't have
to save before you walk outside
--I always tell you where to
save.

You have one last annoying fight
to deal with, and this time it's
a Double Battle! First up is a
level 38 Dustox (Flying, Rock,
Fire, and Psychic moves' damage
--2x) and Stunky (Ground 2x).
The second set is a level 38
Glameow (Fighting 2x) and
Croagunk (Psychic 4x, Flying and
Ground 2x).

Up next is the end.
Congratulations for surviving
this far. It's not easy to tell
when you lose control, so I'll
tell you how many steps are too
many before you save. Using a
reset Step Counter (Poketch app
04), walk 12 steps from in
between the two Grunts, and then
save. If you feel that it was
somewhat difficult to
_perfectly_ understand my
directions, you might as well
save in between the two Grunts.
When you take the 13th step
towards Commander Jupiter,
Commander Mars, and Boss Cryus,
you cannot turn back.

Cyrus will summon either Dialga
or Palkia. Can we say epic?
After Cyrus rants some more, you
will gain control again. Walk in
between Mars and Jupiter,
knowing that two level 41
Bronzors will come your way
first, and with the help of your
rival kick their butts. A level
42 and level 41 Golbat will
replace each Bronzor. By the
way, the left Pokemon on the
bottom screen is the bottom
health bar, just in case the
double pairs confused you. A
level 46 Skuntank replaces the
level 41 Golbat, and a level 45
Purugly replaces the level 42
Golbat.

Thank the heavens that your
rival heals your Pokemon before
he leaves. After some dialogue,
I suggest you pause it for a
while once you start to see
either Dialga or Palkia radiate
--you don't see that many cool
things in Pokemon that often.
Hooray! The Pokemon you helped
out not only stopped the world
from ending, but they also
stopped Cyrus from ever
attempting to end the world
again by breaking his chain.
Cyrus, having been pwned, will
take his vengeance on you.

He'll start the fight off with
his level 45 Honchkrow
(Dark/Flying-Type). Cyrus will
withdraw Honchkrow in a
heartbeat with his level 45
Gyarados (Water/ Flying-Type) if
you do significant damage to it.
Gyarados will also be the
Pokemon that follows a fainted
Honchkrow. If Gyarados ever uses
Giga Impact and your Pokemon
survives, know that Gyarados
must recharge after he uses it.
Third comes Cyrus's level 48
Weavile (Dark/Ice-Type). Lastly,
all you have to deal with is
Cyrus's level 46 Crobat
(Poison/Flying-Type; he was nice
to his Golbat?).

Take his 8640 Pokedollars like
this sucka was a Gym leader,
because he was just as tough.
When they leave, your friend and
Professor Rowan come to give you
some words of encouragement.
Luckily, you have the option of
using your Pokemon Center's
worth of healing supplies that I
told you to buy. That, and you
have the option to save. Now I'm
going to describe both Dialga
and Palkia.

Dialga at level 47 is a Steel
and Dragon-Type: (+) Fighting
and Ground-Type moves does twice
as much damage to it. (-)
Normal, Ghost, Steel, Electric,
Water, Bug, Psychic, Dark, Rock,
and Flying
    -Type moves do half as much
     damage. Grass-Type moves do
     one-quarter damage.
(x) Poison-Type moves do no
damage to it whatsoever.

Palkia at level 47 is a Water
and Dragon-Type: (+) Dragon-Type
moves do twice as much damage to
it. (-) Steel-Type moves do half
as much, and Fire and Water-Type
moves do only
    one-quarter as much damage
    to it.

With this in mind, adjust your
starting Pokemon accordingly. I
suggest you capture it. There is
absolutely no reason for you not
to. Not only that, but don't
ever use a Master Ball on a rare
Pokemon that's stationary.
Always use things like Dusk
Balls, Timer Balls, and Ultra
Balls. What if you luckily came
across a non-stationary
legendary that runs away when
you first see it? Those are
times for Master Balls.

Anyway, make sure you save
immediately after the Cyrus
fight, and after you heal your
Pokemon. After I got it into its
red health, with it pwning one
of my Pokemon in one move
(either Pokemon has its own
super move which causes it to
charge the next turn), I caught
it with my _first_ Dusk Ball--
see how awesome these things
are? I bet that you'd really
feel stupid if you used your one
Master Ball on it. Now, of
course the Dusk Ball won't
capture it in one try for
everyone--I was somewhat lucky.
However, I promise you that
capturing it without a Master
Ball isn't that hard, even
without dumb luck.

Your friend and Professor Rowan
will take you away from where
the fight with either Dialga or
Palkia was. However, don't
immediately leave. Instead,
because you really don't want to
come back up here a second time,
run ALL the way back up, past
where the legendary stood, and
pick up a special item. If you
have the Diamond version of the
game, inside the Pokeball is an
Adamant Orb, which increases the
Steel and Dragon-Type moves of
Dialga. If you have the Pearl
version of the game, instead
will be a Lustrous Orb, which
increases the Water and Dragon-
Type moves of Palkia.

Unfortunately, after everything
you can't fly away, even if
you're on top of a mountain. I
used some of my Super Repels and
rode my bike in the fourth gear
way down and out. However, the
moment you go outside for the
second time (where it snows) is
when you can fly away. Now where
to fly? There are two places of
interest--Celestic Town and
Pastoria/Veilstone City.

What is there to do at Celestic
Town? If you head there and
speak to Cynthia's grandmother
in the big house at the top of
the town, she'll show you a
picture of the legendary that
you didn't have the opportunity
to capture in your version of
the game. After you see that
picture, that other legendary is
put into your Pokedex! That's
actually important in this game,
since merely seeing a Pokemon is
enough for it to count as a
significant entry in your
Pokedex-- just like in the
Pokemon anime.

I suggest you continue your game
by going to Pastoria City, since
there are less wild encounters
along the way as opposed to
Veilstone, even though they are
geographically just as close to
Route 222 to Sunyshore City. No
matter which way you come from,
you end up at the Valor
Lakefront.

    =---------------------------
    =- e. Valor Lakefront and
       Route 222 -=
    =---------------------------

It seems that there's so little
to do now, with the entire plot
of the game completed seven and
a half-ninths of the way through
the game! At least you got more
dialogue in this game than in
previous installations of the
series.

By the way, if you took towards
Valor Lakefront from Pastoria
City, you could have used Rock
Climb to nab TM05 (Roar), for
whatever that's worth.

Once you actually reach the
Valor Lakefront, there are many
more opportunities to make use
of Rock Climb. If you use Rock
Climb at the very southeast part
of this place, going down
towards a cut-off house that
technically lies in Route 213, a
man inside will give you the
Poketch app Coin Toss. In the
trashcan in that same room is a
Max Revive. Further down from
that house is a Protein. East
and north of that house is a
Rare Candy. East and south,
however, is nothing.

If you use Rock Climb behind the
developer's house and continue,
going every which way, you will
eventually be able to collect
TM85 (Dream Eater), on the other
side of the bushes of the house
of the girl you helped out a
long time ago.

Notice that the guy blocking the
road to Sunyshore City is gone.
You almost don't have to fight a
single person at Route 222, but
I felt like celebrating my
imminent 8th Gym Badge retrieval
early and fought everyone.

On the actual road first up is
Rich Boy Trey, with his one
level 43 Luxio. Way past the
grass on the left of the road,
in the middle of three branches
is a hidden Full Restore. Next
up on the actual road is Beauty
Nicola, with her one level 43
Lopunny. If you deviate north
from the road before the dirt
turns into concrete, you will
have the opportunity to cut past
some bushes for a Carbos (a
Honey was to the south).

Next up is a Police Officer, who
will fight only if it is at
nighttime. After him is another
opportunity to have a Double
Battle. I choose not because
they take too long. A level 43
Mantyke is all that Sailor Marc
has. Next to him is Tuber
Conner, who only has a level 43
Remoraid. Last is the only
mandatory fight of Route 222,
pitting you against Sailor
Luther. He has a level 37 Feebas
first, and then sends out a
level 40 Machoke. His Gastrodon
(Water/Ground-Type) at level 43
comes last.

On the beach is the Pikachu Fan
Club and the house of someone
who gives you stuff for showing
him certain big fish Pokemon. I
only fought Tuber Holly's level
43 Remoraid, as she's the only
one who actually looks for a
fight at the beach. A hidden
Honey is in a patch of grass
past a breakable rock. Not only
that, but if you surf further
from that patch of grass, you
can find a hidden Big Mushroom
in some more grass.

Next up is Sunyshore City.
You've almost collected your
final badge. I'd be excited if I
were you.

    =---------------------------
    =- f. Sunyshore City -=
    =- EIGHTH GYM - Leader:
       Volkner -=
    =---------------------------

As soon as you exit the other
side of the gate, Flint of the
Elite Four will run up to you
and ask if you'd please fight
this city's Gym leader. Of
course you'll help him out. Now
this city is weird. I'm going to
try to describe locations
instead of places, so bear with
me.

If you want to leave this city
going north and expect to get
anywhere, as Jasmine (Gym leader
in Gold/Silver/Crystal versions)
pointed out, you'll need all 8
badges, so don't bother heading
towards Victory Road for now.

New at the Pokemart is Steel
Mail, the Luxury Ball (which
captures like a Pokeball, but
acts like Gold/Silver/Crystal's
Friend Ball), and nothing else.

Northwest of the Pokemart is
obviously the Seal market. It's
the only place in the game where
you can buy Seals for adding
special effects to your
Pokemon's Pokeball entrances
during battles (just in case you
hadn't figured that out by now).
The man wearing glasses will
sell different Seals every day,
and his selection's rotation
restarts every week.

At the very northeast part of
the city, a girl named Julia
might give you Ribbons starting
the day after you meet her if
you tell her stories.

In the southeastern-most part of
town is a Thunderstone inside a
Pokeball, and up the rocks to
the right is a house inside of
which is a man who gives you
different Poketch apps based on
the different natures of the
Pokemon you show him.

He starts off wanting to see a
Pokemon with a serious nature,
and if you show him a Pokemon
with such a nature, he'll give
you the Calendar app. Next, show
him a Pokemon with a naive
nature to receive the Dot Artist
app. Lastly, show him a Pokemon
with a Quirky Nature to get the
Roulette app.

Volkner isn't at his Gym at the
moment, so meet up with him at
the lighthouse, which is at the
very southeastern-most part of
the city. After he brags a
little to you, he'll leave.
Before you go, look through the
binoculars for something really
cool--a view of the castle where
the Elite Four and the Champion
reside!

Flint has been standing at the
door of Volkner's Gym, so talk
with him now that you've found
Volkner and he'll leave.

In the first neat room of his
Gym, School Kid Tiera has one
level 44 Pachirisu to throw at
you. In the second room, fight
Guitarist Jerry's one level 44
Luxio. In this second room, you
obviously have no other choice
than to hit the blue button
three times.

After you hit it for the third
time, run around to the left and
fight School Kid Forrest and his
one level 44 Mr. Mime. Following
the match, hit the nearby blue
button, and then hit the green
button. Now the path to the
right has been opened. Obviously
the Pikachu is Poke Kid Meghan,
wielding four level 41 Pikachus.

In the next room, you'll
probably have to beat Guitarist
Lonnie. Beat his level 44 Raichu
to continue. Press the red
button on the right once, then
immediately walk south from it
then left towards the other red
button. South from the second
red button is Ace Trainer
Destiny, who wields a level 44
Kadabra and Raichu.

Walk up the ramp to the left of
Destiny and fight Guitarist
Preston, who starts the battle
with his level 42 Luxio. After
that will come his level 42
Bibarel. Hit the green button up
there twice, and then run around
(the electricity doesn't hurt
you nor block your path) to hit
the blue button. The last
trainer that stands between you
and the last Gym leader is Ace
Trainer Zachery, with his level
44 Steelix and Medicham. Notice
that you can run down from
Zachery to a new exit out of
here. It took me two trips to
beat all of the trainers here,
so I definitely needed to heal
after the second trip. You heal
and return too.

When you return to the third
room, complete the same button-
pressing sequence in addition to
playing around with the red
button down to the right
(typically the first one you
ever press), in order to get to
the Gym leader.

Gym Leader Volkner's Pokemon
are: (1) Raichu: Lv. 46 (2)
Octillery: Lv. 47 (Water-Type)
(3) Luxray (w/ Sitrus Berry):
Lv. 49 (4) Ambipom: Lv. 47
(Normal-Type)

Man, I don't know what to tell
you. I took all four down in one
hit, and I only used my level 44
Infernape (Using Close Combat
against Ambipom), and my level
45 Torterra (Using Earthquake
against Raichu and Luxray, and
Razor Leaf against Octillery). I
noted the types of the Pokemon
that weren't obviously the
Electric-Type to help out anyone
who had trouble figuring out
what to send in next. In fact, I
had to be told by someone else
that Volkner's Luxray was
holding a Sitrus Berry. You
should know your type weaknesses
by now.

Take this guy's 5880
Pokedollars. Also take his TM57
(Charge Beam) and Beacon Badge,
which allows you to use the
Hidden Move Waterfall outside of
battle, in addition to allowing
you to control any Pokemon at
any level at all times. Notice
while you leave that your rival
isn't a certified trainer.
Regardless, you kept your
promise to Flint, and you're
almost at the end. Up next is
Route 223, which is also known
as Victory Road.

Before you leave, know that you
have only completed the first of
the three endurance tests in
this game. The first endurance
test was you up against Team
Galactic at Mt. Coronet. The
second is Victory Road. Some may
consider Victory Road to be
tougher than Mt. Coronet. No
matter how you feel, you should
take Victory Road with the same
amount of seriousness as Team
Galactic, which is impossible,
so take it instead with the same
amount of seriousness as Mt.
Coronet as a whole.

Having stocked up on supplies
and having healed, talk to
Jasmine on the beach to receive
HM07 (Waterfall), which replaced
my Empoleon's Aqua Jet perfectly
(Same PP, double damage, and
there's the added HM usage).

All there is left to do is to
head to Route 223.


--------------------------------
9) Seeking the Championship
--------------------------------

    =---------------------------
    =-         a. Route 223     
    =---------------------------

As you surf past Jasmine, dodge
the first two trainers as best
you can. Remember that your main
priority is self-preservation.
The first trainer that you have
to fight is Swimmer Oscar, who
has a level 38 Mantyke, a level
40 Remoraid, and a level 42
Mantine. Don't feel bad if the
wild Pokemon and Trainer's
Pokemon are at your level,
because the path to the Elite
Four is shorter this time
around, and you can always use
Repels, if they even work. After
Oscar is a double battle; first
pair is a level 37 Wingull and
level 39 Marill. The second pair
is a level 42 Quagsire and level
40 Wingull, followed by a level
41 Pelipper and Golduck.

After you defeat Colton and
Paige, swim left around the rock
on the left to avoid the girl
swimming wildly, but not too far
as to run into the male swimmer
even farther left and north.
When you reach shallow waters,
pick up the Pearl at the top and
swim around the shallow waters
to avoid the sailor. Swim and
walk around the left, and
carefully dodge the woman.

Reach the shallow water above as
a safe haven. In order to dodge
as much wild Pokemon as
possible, head towards the
shallow water that is off to the
right. From there, surf north
avoiding the swimmer. After
that, all you do is surf up the
waterfall.

    =---------------------------
    =- b. Victory Road -=
    =---------------------------

Of course take the opportunity
to heal up at the Pokemon
Center. If you look at your map,
it'll look like you've gone a
lot farther than it seems you
have. Note that you can also fly
here. Victory Road will be one
of the many places that you'll
be using to train, in addition
to Route 223. It only took one
Max Repel to reach Victory Road,
and it'll probably take another
two to pass it. You can now head
into the cave.

Take the opportunity to train
inside Victory Road. None of my
Repels would even work when I
first came here, as almost all
Pokemon were of a higher level
than me. Don't be in a hurry to
pass this place by until your
Pokemon are all at least level
50, or 55 if you want to
immediately head to the Elite
Four. I'm serious too. Almost
everyone who reaches the Elite
Four in this game immediately
returns here to train once
they've learned that they cannot
defeat the Elite Four. At the
very least you should train
until your Repels work...

Going down the rocks after the
first bridge will only get you
TM41 (Torrent) and a fight with
Psychic Bryce, and her level 43
Haunter, level 46 Gengar, and
level 46 Alakazam. After you
pass the second bridge, if you
head down the slope and fight
Bird Keeper Hana with level 46
Noctowl level 48 Staraptor, you
can get a Full Heal.

After you pass the third bridge,
obviously head down the rocks
and head left until you reach a
slope going north. You'll run
into an inevitable fight with
Ace Trainer Mariah, with her
level 46 Golduck and level 48
Blissey, which might be the
first time you've seen this
Pokemon. A hidden Max Elixir is
hidden at the end of that
particular elevation of earth.
Take the two slopes into the
room on the left.

In this place, alternate your
bike's two gears to clear the
different ramps. Immediately
head left, and then work around
towards a Max Ether. When you
break the rocks below the
entrance and head south, don't
push the first boulder down.
Instead, fight the Ace Trainer
Omar, who has a level 45
Rapidash, Carnivine (probably
the first time you've seen it),
and level 48 Rampardos. Push the
second boulder down, break the
rocks below it, and push the
boulder back up. A mandatory
fight comes up with you against
Ace Trainer Sydney's level 46
Clefable (most likely the first
time you've seen it) and level
48 Torterra.

Lastly in this place, know that
the boulders won't do anything
different unless you return from
above, after which you will run
into more puzzles and a chance
to fight a Double Battle (of a
level 47 Staraptor and Whiscash)
and collect TM71 (Stone Edge) as
well as a Full Restore. There's
an optional fight with Veteran
Clayton. He has a level 47
Staraptor and Hippowdon, the
latter of which I'm sure you
haven't seen before. Head down
the slope above Veteran Clayton.

In the next room, make sure that
you don't accidentally jump off
a ledge after you rock climb
down. You'll have a fight with
Black Belt Miles and his one
level 49 Machamp, which you
might not have seen yet. See all
the wonderful opportunities to
fill up your Pokedex? Obviously,
you will need to head down the
next slope.

In the next room, pay attention
to the gap in the rock while you
swim, and at the same time
notice the inevitable fight with
Psychic Valencia. She has a
level 44 Chingling and level 48
Chimecho, which you probably
haven't seen by now. There's an
optional fight with Ace Trainer
Henry running up and down with
his one level 49 Honchkrow in
this room if you're interested.
Not only that, but there's one
other optional fight with two
Ace Trainers below Henry, but
not before you pass a hidden
Pearl on the left. They have a
level 47 Gyarados and Medicham.
Eventually past those two in
that direction is a Rare Candy.

Head up the waterfall, picking
up TM59 (Dragon Pulse) on the
way up before fighting Dragon
Tamer Ondrej (Green hair), who
has one level 49 Gabite (Dragon/
Ground-Type) on the way up
towards the left. On your way
out, there's a hidden Big
Mushroom on one of the rocks.

In the next room, you can pass
Veteran Edgar for now in order
to get a Razor Claw to the left,
or get a Zinc past the big man
guarding an opening in the wall
(who leaves after you get the
National Pokedex) to the right.
Once you get both of these
things, fight Edgar, and he'll
throw a level 45 Tentacruel,
Golem, and level 48 Empoleon at
you. After that fight with
Edger, rock climbing to the left
will eventually net you TM79
(Dark Pulse)in a small room.
Rock climb to the right to fight
Dragon Tamer Clinton, who first
has a level 46 Gible to fight
you with. He sends out the same
thing next, followed by a level
49 Gyarados. After Clinton comes
the exit, and you'll know the
way after that.

    =---------------------------
    =- c. The Pokemon League -=
    =---------------------------

When you get inside, heal first.
Buy four Pokemon Center's worth
of supplies at the shop, because
you'll be battling five people--
the Elite Four and the Champion,
like in every single other
conventional Pokemon game.

By the way, I had 144 Pokemon
seen in my Pokedex before I went
up against the League. By the
time I was done, I had seen 150,
enabling me to pick up my
National Pokedex just as the
main portion of my game ended.
You too can simultaneously
finish the main game and
immediately collect your
National Pokedex, which allows
you to do all the fun stuff
after the Elite Four.

Before you do fight Elite Four,
you'll have to battle your rival
as soon as you try to talk to
the lady in front of the
entrance.

Your rival first has a level 48
Staraptor. Secondly will come
the fully evolved starter that
has the advantage over yours, at
level 53. Third will be his
level 50 Heracross (Bug-Type).
Fourth will come his level 49
Floatzel. Fifth will come his
level 51 Snorlax (Normal-Type),
which I bet you've probably
never seen by now. Lastly will
be his level 49 Roserade. After
you receive his chump change and
pouting, the Elite Four and
Champion are all yours.

Just in case you'd like to know
how I did it, I'll list what I
brought with me:

Pokemon Team: Items: Alakazam w/
TwistedSpoon Lvl. 57 Potion x 11
Burn Heal x 20 Torterra w/ Shell
Bell Lvl. 56 Super Potion x 20
Ice Heal x 20 Empoleon w/ Mystic
Water Lvl. 57 Hyper Potion x 24
Full Heal x 30 Infernape w/
Charcoal Lvl. 57 Max Potion x 2
Full Restore x 3 Staraptor w/
Sharp Beak Lvl. 56 Awakening x
30 Max Elixir x 2 Dialga w/
Adamant Orb Lvl. 47 Antidote x
30 Revive x 20
         Parlyz Heal x 30 Max
         Revive x 2

Now it can be argued that I came
over-prepared as far as items
go, however I don't think that
fighting the Elite Four and the
Champion with a team that's
mostly below level 55 is wise no
matter who you are. I also
suggest that no matter what you
bring, you bring along just as
many Hyper Potions and Revives.

I didn't use Dialga at all, and
I barely used the supplies I
brought with me, but there's no
way I want to risk losing money
over saving anywhere within the
league itself. Also, my Torterra
had about five other items that
I gave it. I gave it a Big Root
if I wanted to focus on its Giga
Drain attack in the upcoming
fight, or I gave it BlackGlasses
if I wanted to focus using its
Crunch attack. In addition,
Miracle Seed boosted its Grass-
Type moves and Soft Sand boosted
its Ground-Type move Earthquake.

When you're prepared yourself,
talk to the lady who will check
your badges. When she moves to
the side, save the game. Walk
through the doorway.

As you walk up the elevator and
past the door that locks behind
you, notice that you can't surf
through that locked door, unlike
the earlier Japanese versions.
This is proof that the Elite
Four door glitch cannot be
exploited in the NTSC (American
English) versions period.

The Dustox and Beautifly go down
like any other Dustox and
Beautifly that you've fought
hundreds of times before. Only
Ground-Type moves are super
effective against Drapion, which
has many anti-grass moves.
Heracross also isn't anything
special.

Take his 6840 Pokedollars and
compliments and head to the next
person.

                        Bertha:

    +---------------------------

Don't be fooled by her claims
that she's the Ground-Type
Pokemon master, thus causing you
to put some Water-Type out in
front. Grass-Type moves are the
only moves that are super
effective against Quagsire.
Whiscash, like Quagsire, is only
vulnerable to Grass-Type moves;
however, Whiscash is also much
quicker than Quagsire, and much
more powerful--it will give
Bertha the chance to use a Full
Restore.

For a lover of the Ground-Type,
Bertha sure is lacking in her
own department. You can send in
anything typical for the Rock-
Type Sudowoodo. Hippowdon is her
first Ground-Type, so Water,
Grass, and Ice-Type moves each
do twice as much damage to it.
Be warned that Hippowdon will
automatically summon a
Sandstorm. If you have any Grass
and Water-Type Pokemon, keep
them for Golem, as it is four
times as susceptible to those
Pokemons' types of moves.

Take her 7080 Pokedollars and
compliments and head to the next
fight.

                         Four

                         -------

    +---------------------------

For a Fire-Type master, Flint
also doesn't do well in his own
field, like Bertha. Like the
typical Fire-Type Pokemon,
Water, Rock, and Ground-Type
moves do double damage to
Rapidash. Because you probably
have used your Water-Type of
your team to death, have a
Flying or Psychic-Type to deal
with Infernape.

While Steelix can still be
fought with Fighting and Ground-
Type moves, it has a lot less
Special Defense than Defense.
Because of this, I suggest you
use either Fire or Water-Type
moves against it. Because I was
wearing down my Empoleon, I
brought out my Infernape.

Only Fighting-Type moves are
twice as effective against
Normal-Type Pokemon, so Lopunny
was one Pokemon I used Close
Combat on. Drifblim was the only
Pokemon out of them all that
intimidated me. Rock, Ghost,
Electric, Ice, and Dark-Type
moves are super effective
against it, and forget Poison,
Grass, Normal, Fighting, and
Ground-Type moves. It's
Aftermath ability is deadly, and
it can waste Dark-Type moves
when you really need them for
later.

Take his 7320 Pokedollars,
useless compliments, and leave.

    | #4 Girafarig | 59 | Normal
    / Psychic | | #5
    Bronzong(Sitrus Berry) | 63
    | Steel / Psychic |
    +---------------------------

Take advantage of the fact that
Mr. Mime has low Physical
Defense, so I did and switched
my Torterra's Shell Bell with
BlackGlasses, to make sure I
didn't use up too much PP.
However, it has high Speed, so
allowing it to survive more than
one turn was out of the
question.

What a pleasant surprise--
Medicham. I really can't say I
know of a Pokemon that I hate
more than this one, and maybe
Meditite before it. Only Flying
and Ghost- Type moves are good
against it, unfortunately. At
least only Fighting and Rock-
Type moves are the only ones
that aren't very effective,
because you might need all that
you can muster to take this
thing down fast. Be warned that
Medicham has an Ice Punch
waiting for your Flying-Type.

Treat Alakazam exactly as you
did Mr. Mime. The difference is
that he's faster and more
powerful, so you'll really need
some good luck to survive it.
Note that Alakazam has the move
Focus Blast, which is a high-
powered Fighting-Type special
(as in, not-physical) move.
Focus Blast is something you
might want for your own Psychic-
Type to deal with those Dark-
Type Pokemon.

Unfortunately, only Bug and
Dark-Type moves are super
effective against Girafarig,
which is a bummer because this
Pokemon actually has decent
defense. It's actually a rather
weak Pokemon, so the fact that
not much is super effective
against it really isn't all that
bad.

Lastly, Bronzong is only twice
as susceptible to Fire-Type
moves--nothing else. While
Bronzong comes in two varieties,
this particular one isn't the
one that absorbs Fire. You
shouldn't have problems with
this.

Take his 7560 Pokedollars and
good tidings. You are about to
face supposedly the strongest
trainer in your game. The
Champion is the only one now in
between you and the end.

Make sure you arrange your team
before you enter the Champion's
room!

    +---------------------------

Spiritomb has no weaknesses, but
Poison-Type moves are
ineffective, and it can't even
be touched by Normal, Fighting,
and Psychic-Type moves. If you
have an Empoleon, you should use
it because all of Spiritomb's
attacks are weak against
Empoleon's Water/Steel-Type.

Milotic has a weakness to Grass
and Electric-Type moves. The
only thing that Gastrodon is
weak against is Grass-Type
moves. So far, nothing seems to
be much of a problem.

Garchomp may be the first
Pokemon ever to give you a very,
very serious problem, unless you
have Ice-Type moves. Ice-Type
moves are 4x, and Dragon-Type
moves are 2x as effective.
Poison, Rock, Fire, and
Electric-Type moves are no good
to use. Don't send out anything
that is of the Steel-Type, as it
can use the move Earthquake.
Take advantage of the delay of
Garchomp's Giga Impact, and
using a Flying-Pokemon so its
Earthquake and Brick Break won't
be as effective is a good
strategy too.

After Garchomp, Roserade and
Lucario is pretty much the
fight. Neither of the last two
are that powerful, and you
probably know their weaknesses.

The 13200 Poke is nothing
compared to the fact that you
are now the champion.

Your team will be entered into
the Hall of Fame after that, and
Professor Rowan will join you
and Cynthia. Who could have
asked for a more awesome Hall of
Fame debut and Credits?
Congratulations!

After the credits, the game will
end and next time you start up
your game, you will be in the
bedroom of your house. Check
your Trainer Card to see a new
star added to it!

When you walk down the stairs,
your mother will relay a message
to you from your rival, who says
that the ship at the dock of
Snowpoint City is now available
to you, and that's true. Only
Champions are allowed to that
big island that you've been
gawking at, wondering what's
there. You can go there at any
time you want now, but I'll be
talking about those locations
later.


Thank you for using my guide. I
hope I was able to help you in
whatever it was that you might
have had trouble with. I plan to
continue to update this guide
with all the stuff you can do
after you beat the League at
later times, but for now, enjoy
your victory.


================================
        {OPTIONAL AREAS}
--------------------------------
1) The Underground
--------------------------------

The underground is actually a
surprisngly fun thing to do with
your friends. If you haven't
learned the basics of the
basics, you need to find the
Underground Man at Eterna City
first. If you don't know what to
do with him, you can search for
"e. Eterna City", and look for
him in that section.

You can make a secret base
anywhere you like, and visit
your friend's secret bases as
well. I'm going to run your
through the possibly confusing
parts of the basics. The main
activity is digging up spheres,
which is the game's name for the
minerals that you dig from
walls. These spheres is the main
currency used underground. They
come in different sizes, and
there are 20 merchants scattered
underground who will barter with
you. Spheres are acquired by
digging in walls that are near
the moving yellow sparkles on
the map. Tap the screen to find
them. Press A on the wall to
begin a mining minigame, or on
the ground to disarm a trap.

In the mining minigame, your
objective is to uncover the many
different items beneath
different layers of rock. You
have a Hammer and Pick-Axe at
your disposal and a certain
number of swings before the
whole wall comes tumbling down,
ending your game. You can get
normal items in addition to
spheres.

When you press X underground, a
whole different menu comes up.
You can set traps to annoy your
buddies when they're trying to
capture your flag. Eight of the
twenty merchants down there will
give you spheres in exchange for
spheres, and you can give them
spheres in exchange for traps.
Eight of the twenty merchants
will trade spheres and Secret
Base Goods with you. The last
four of the twenty simply will
buy treasures from you for
spheres.

If you don't have the right-
sized Sphere, but have multiple-
smaller spheres of the same
type, you can bury them in the
same place and get one combined
sphere of increased size.
However, the sizes don't stack
exactly. For example, a Red
Sphere 07 and Red Sphere 16 will
yield only a Red Sphere 18.
Because of this, it is advised
that you only stack when you
have to, and stack the smallest
things as possible onto the
bigger things. You'll find that
you'll eventually run out of
room, so stacking will
eventually be inevitable.

You'll occassionally dig up some
Treasure, which basically is an
item that has a use outside of
the Underground. Either you can
sell them to those four
particular merchants, or you can
select them in the menu and send
them straight into your Item
bag. If you dig up a Fossil, you
can take it to the scientist
behind the counter at the
Oreburgh Mining Museum and have
him turn it into a level 20
Pokemon for you (walk right back
in after you leave and he'll
already be done with the
procedure).

Capturing other people's flags
of their bases is what actually
does some good for you, in a
way. When you capture your first
flag, yours is upgraded to a
Bronze Flag, which gives you the
ability to place a dozen items
underground, as well as the
opportunity to remove one
boulder.

After you have registered three
flags, your flag becomes a
Silver Flag. With this, you can
now put away up to five big
boulders (four more than you use
to be able to), and decorate
your room with 15 decorations.

After you have collected ten
flags, your flag becomes a Gold
Flag. After you get this, you
can put away ten big boulders
(five more possible than
before). While you can't put any
more items in your room, you can
now use a Radar function on your
PC, which can help you search
for your own spheres, traps, and
treasure.

50 is the magic number. With a
Platinum Base flag, you can
remove the remaining six
boulders in your base, in
addition to your Trainer's Card
being upgraded with a star--the
only practical Trainer upgrade
before beating the Elite Four,
unless you're an avid Super
Contestant kind of person.

If you feel that it takes too
much time to get the spheres to
get goods for your base, you can
always buy some up above like at
the fourth floor of the
Veilstone Department Store.

That's the Underground covered
for you. To speed up the tedious
process of running to your
friend's base and then back to
yours 50 times, I suggest you
two put your bases close
together.


--------------------------------
2) Pal Park
--------------------------------

The National Pokedex opens up a
world of things to do after
you've beaten the Elite Four.
One of those things is Pal Park.

Pal Park is located at the very
end of Routes 219-221, which are
south of Sandgem Town. Along the
routes you will encounter
Pokemon in their mid-30s, as
well as minor trainers who are
willing to block your path. If
you hug the east and northern
walls towards Pal Park, you will
only have to battle one
collector. By the way, TM81
(X-Scissor) is just below the
entrance to it.

While Pal Park can be reached
before you acquire the National
Pokedex, it's worthless to you
until then. I'll continue the
explanation as if you have that
Pokedex upgrade.

When you first arrive at Pal
Pak, Professor Oak will stop
you, though he'll only be there
if he gave you the National
Pokedex earlier. He gives you
the Trainer Counter Poketch app.
When he leaves, he says that he
will stay at Eterna City.

In this place there are two
people of interest. There's a
girl to the left who will give
you the Kitchen Timer Poketch
application (#21) if you show
her a Snorlax. After you show
her the Snorlax, she'll give you
the Color Changer application
(#22) if you show her a Kecleon.

The man standing in between the
counters will ask you to
participate in the hunts if you
have the National Pokedex. After
this, a new option will appear
in the Startup screen if you
have a conventional Pokemon game
in the GBA slot when you turn on
your game.

A "Migrate from (Insert Game
Name Here)" option will appear
when you start up your game. You
will always have to transfer 6
Pokemon that are inside boxes
every time you transfer, though
you can only do the process once
a day from any GBA Pokemon game.
The transfer is always
permanent, so it only goes GBA
-> DS; not the other way around.
The transferred Pokemon retain
absolutely every_ single_detail
that they had in the previous
game. In addition, all HM moves
must be deleted from the Pokemon
that are transferred, even if
it's an HM that Diamond or Pearl
retained. I suggest you find
that game's Move Deleter in
order to make the transfer work.

Once you've transferred Pokemon,
you may hunt them in the Pal
Park to find them again. You're
equipped with just enough Park
Balls (which act like Master
Balls) to recapture all your
Pokemon. Remember what I said
about every_single_ detail being
retained from the previous
games? I didn't lie. Not only
will you find the same Pokemon
in the Park, but the Original
Trainer Name and Identification
Number, as well as what ball
caught them (even though you're
"recapturing" them with Park
Balls) is kept intact.

The Pokemon you transferred will
be in an area in the small Park
that they're normally found in.
Your fish Pokemon will be in the
lake to the southeast, for
example. After you find all your
Pokemon again, the round (which
has no time limit) will end.

In order to collect all 493
Pokemon in the world, you need
to transfer from the GBA games
(especially the previous starter
and legendary Pokemon). The Pal
Park will help you do that. Also
note that you do not have to
have the National Pokedex in the
GBA game to make the transfer--
you're not trading; instead,
you're extracting Pokemon from
those games.


--------------------------------
3) Fuego Ironworks
--------------------------------

This place is well hidden, and
can be accessed as soon as you
can surf. To begin to find this
place, head to Floaroma Town and
head east to Route 205. As soon
as you get to the first bridge
over water, surf west completely
downstream (you can tell it's
downstream by the current, not
the direction) until you can go
no further; if you surf to the
east from the bridge as far as
you can go, you can pick up TM24
(Thunderbolt).

When you reach the Fuego
Ironworks, you can travel south
into the northern part of
Floaroma Town for a Miracle
Seed; make sure you don't
accidentally drop down over the
ledge, causing you to go all the
way back.

Around the right side of the
building is a hidden Max Potion.
There is an interesting and
retro (as far as Pokemon games
are concerned) "puzzle" inside
the building. However, it's more
fun to figure out how to do it
all yourself than for me to
explain it to you--besides, you
don't need to beat this place to
go further in your game.

There are only three battles and
three free items on the ground.
Burn Heal, Fire Stone, and Rock
Incense can all be found.
However, if you want to reach
the man in the middle of the
room (don't be tricked by trying
to enter from above; enter from
below), you'll be forced to
fight Worker Conrad's one level
33 Rapidash.

The big prize of this place is
not what Mr. Fuego gives you,
another Fire Stone, but what's
next to his furnace--TM35
(Flamethrower)! This is the
perfect move to teach your
Infernape, over its Flame Wheel.

After you get the free TM35 (you
can always buy more for 10,000
Coins at the Veilstone Game
Corner), there's nothing else to
do here. You might as well leave
this place.


--------------------------------
4) Iron Island: Getting Riolu
--------------------------------

Another optional area that
serves little purpose, Iron
Island, can be accessed from
Canalave City. Before you go to
Iron Island, drop off one of
your Pokemon at the Pokemon
Center, making sure you have no
more than five in your Party.
Yes, the most important reason
to come here is for the Riolu
Egg, which will eventually turn
into Lucario!

So head to Canalave City, and
ask the sailor on the left side
of the water to take you to Iron
Island.

When you arrive, pick up a
hidden Max Ether on a small rock
above the stairs. No one is at
the house for now, so head
straight into the opening in the
rock.

In the room that the slope on
the left takes you is an Iron
Ball inside a Pokeball and one
trainer.

South, soon into the room from
the right slope of the entrance,
is an Escape Rope. A Super Repel
is all the way around towards
the right. A trainer, Picnicker
Summer, has a level 31 Staravia
and Cherrim, and is difficult to
dodge on your way down.

In the room down from the slope
on the right, there are two
trainers walking around, a Max
Ether, TM23 (Iron Tail), and a
hidden Iron. The room down from
the slope to the left after the
elevator is where you need to
go.

Down there, a trainer named
Riley will accompany you,
because the wild Pokemon are
apparently "restless". Dodge the
first two hikers, as Double
Battles take too long. On the
other side of them is an Ultra
Ball. An Iron Plate, for the
Arceus you don't have, is hidden
on the very bottom-right part of
the room. The first mandatory
Double Battle down here is with
the two Ace Trainers (they have
Green Hair). First up is a level
31 Ponyta and level 33 Pelipper;
a level 34 Floatzel and level 33
Sudowoodo come next. Lastly is
one level 31 Haunter.

Like the Eterna Forest, your
team will be healed after each
battle. The second, and only
other mandatory battle down here
is with leftover Team Galactic
Grunts. The first pair of enemy
Pokemon is a level 31 Zubat and
level 32 Glameow; a level 32
Stunky replaces the Glameow, and
another similar Zubat replaces
the Zubat. A level 32 Croagunk
replaces the Stunky, and a level
34 Golbat follows the second
Zubat.

After that fight you get the
Riolu Egg! It takes 6,400 steps
to hatch it, so make sure you
reset your Step Counter (#4) and
save at 6,000 steps before it
hatches so you get exactly what
you want. Riolu doesn't evolve
into Lucario at a specific
level. Rather, it evolves when
it levels up during the daytime,
providing that it is happy with
you.

Leave by the elevator below,
which will eventually take you
outside, but not before you go
by a Shiny Stone inside a
Pokeball.

That leaves not much else to do
here. In the empty house will be
Byron if you beat the Elite
Four. He'll talk to you about
his sons, and then give you a
Metal Coat, which can be used to
evolve Onix into Steelix or
Scyther into Scizor. He'll leave
after that.


--------------------------------
5) The Three Lakes: Verity,
   Acuity, and Valor
--------------------------------

    =---------------------------
    =- a. Verity Lakefront:
       Getting Mesprit -=
    =---------------------------

Like the three legendary birds
of the Red, Blue, and Yellow
versions, the three legendary
dogs of the Gold, Silver, and
Crystal versions, and the three
legendary (rocks?) of the Ruby,
Sapphire, and Emerald versions,
this game has its legendary
trio.

I'm not sure what to call this
Pokemon, as it doesn't look like
it's based off of any real life
animal, but it's up for the
grabs. This Pokemon takes almost
no time to capture, and can be
captured after your game's
exclusive legendary has been
captured.

For this particular Pokemon, fly
to Twinleaf Town and head west
to Verity Lake. Surf into the
middle of the lake and press the
A button on this Pokemon. It
will teleport away, as that's
the reason I didn't tell you to
save.

After it leaves, Professor Rowan
will ask you to use the Marking
Map (#13) application of your
Poketch to search for it. If you
move about aimlessly by foot or
by bicycle, Mesprit will show up
on that map (you can't use your
Pokedex, unlike how you might
have done so for the legendary
dogs), so go to where it is.

Now this Pokemon will move away
from you a lot of the time.
Whatever you do, do not fly at
all. What you should do is try
to plant yourself in between the
edge of any location and right
next to an area with wild
Pokemon in it.

Walk back and forth in between
those two areas and this
legendary Pokemon will run to a
new area each time you cross
boundaries. Continue to change
location by walking back and
forth until it appears near you
in an area of wild Pokemon. This
Pokemon will most likely be the
one you will see first when you
go into the grass. If you don't
see it that often, then use a
Repel to keep the weaker Pokemon
at bay.

When you do find it in the wild,
it'll be at level 50, and it's a
Psychic-Type. I suggest you use
a Pokemon with an ability that
keeps it from fleeing, or use a
move that does the same.
However, I used a Master Ball
because it is one of two
legendaries that moves about in
this game, with Cresselia (I'll
talk about her in the next
section) being the only other.

Mesprit, if you don't have a way
of keeping it still, will retain
all damage and status conditions
afflicted upon it from all
previous encounters. Unless you
defeat it, removing it from your
game, you can continue to find
it again and again. However, you
won't have a chance of capturing
it unless you use a move like
"Mean Look". You cannot count on
putting it to sleep to keep it
from fleeing, but putting it to
sleep does increase the
likelihood of capture.

There are two others like
Mesprit, except they don't run
all over the place.

    =---------------------------
    =- b. Acuity Lakefront:
       Getting Uxie -=
    =---------------------------

Uxie is not as difficult to
obtain as Mesprit, as it stays
put and doesn't run away when
you encounter it. Fly to
Snowpoint City and travel west
towards Acuity Lake.

When you arrive at the lake, and
remember that this one also
doesn't show without your game's
exclusive legendary being
already taken care of, surf
towards the middle island.

Once you reach the island, you
can go ahead and walk in. Save
before you press A on this
creature, as it's at level 50,
of the Psychic-Type, and there's
only one of these. You should
know that Fighting and Psychic-
Type moves are the only moves
that are not very effective
against it, as you want to make
sure that you don't kill it.

Because it is inside a Cave, use
the Dusk Ball, even if it isn't
at nighttime. This Pokemon is
rather difficult to capture, so
don't lose hope because your
first twenty Dusk Balls failed.
Remember that there's an option
to use "Item used last", to
speed things up.

Don't you dare waste more than
20 Dusk Balls on it. That's
20,000 Pokedollars down the
drain. Remember that there's
always the possibility of a
first-throw capture. If it's not
caught within the first 20 Dusk
Balls, turn off your game even
if it's caught by number 21--the
Pokemon itself is not worth more
than the money you spend on the
Pokeballs to capture it with.

If you think you're special, and
no one spent more time on it
than you, think again. I,
myself, had to restart after
having to use 20 Dark Balls the
first time, and the second time
it took 8 Dusk Balls. And I'm
sure that there are even worse
stories out there, of even worse
luck, so don't complain to me or
anyone on any message board
about it.

    =---------------------------
    =- c. Valor Lakefront:
       Getting Azelf -=
    =---------------------------

A lot has happened at Valor Lake
since you took care of business
at Mt. Coronet. Now this lake
has filled back up and is
healthy again. In addition to
giving you the opportunity to
capture another rare Pokemon,
TM25 (Thunder) can be found in
some grass to the southeast part
of the lake area.

In the same way you caught the
other two, this legendary also
resides in the very center cave
in the middle of the lake. Also
like last time, make sure you
save before you capture this
level 50 Psychic-Type.

Like its brethren, Azelf is also
annoying to capture. Again,
don't use more than 20 Dusk
Balls trying to catch it.

With the capture of Azelf makes
the last of the trio for you to
deal with. Unless you are dying
for a Psychic-Type Pokemon, none
of these Pokemon are that
special or useful. However, it
is nice to put your name (as in
Original Trainer ID) on a
legendary, to call your own.


--------------------------------
6) Fullmoon Island: Getting
   Cresselia
--------------------------------

After you get the National
Pokedex, a side quest becomes
available to you. The sailor's
son in Canalave City is sick. Go
to the house that is the closest
to the sailor and his boat.
Inside will be that sailor's son
in bed with his mother beside
him.

When you press A when near the
boy, his mother will comment on
his health, in addition saying
that the boy has been muttering
"Dar... Dark...is
watching...me..." Obviously
Darkrai, the Nightmare Pokemon,
is giving this boy a hard time.
Exit the house and talk to the
sailor.

He tells you that he needs a
Lunar Wing from Fullmoon Island
in order to awaken him. If you
accept his request, he'll take
you to that place.

Fullmoon Island isn't that
special. Not only that, it's
small and the only purpose it
serves has to do with this side
quest and filling up your
Pokedex with one legendary. Walk
the only way you can go, into
the woods, when you get there.

Don't be afraid to immediately
press A when near Cresselia.
It'll merely leave, just like
Mesprit, leaving behind a Lunar
Wing in the Pokeball. When you
return to the sailor, he'll take
you back to Canalave City soon
after.

Walk inside his house and
approach the kid in bed. The kid
will awaken and the father will
come and leave. You get no
reward...except that now
Cresselia is off somewhere in
the wild. Like Mesprit, go after
it, using your Marking Map
Poketch application (#13) in
order to check its location.

Use the same, extremely
effective strategy I gave you
when you went after Mesprit:

Do not fly at all. What you
should do is try to plant
yourself in between the edge of
any location and right next to
an area with wild Pokemon in it.

Walk back and forth in between
those two areas and this
legendary Pokemon will run to a
new area each time you cross
boundaries. Continue to change
location by walking back and
forth until it appears near you
in an area of wild Pokemon. This
Pokemon will most likely be the
one you will see first when you
go into the grass. If you don't
see it that often, then use a
Repel to keep the weaker Pokemon
at bay.

Cresselia, like the legendary
trio, is at level 50 and is of
the Psychic-Type. You'll also
want to be able to keep it from
escaping somehow, as, like
Mesprit, it'll flee the first
chance it gets.

Remember that Cresselia, if you
don't have a way of keeping it
still, will retain all damage
and status conditions afflicted
upon it from all previous
encounters. Unless you defeat
it, removing it from your game,
you can continue to find it
again, put it to sleep to
prevent it from fleeing, and
continue to use Dusk Balls or
other non-Master Balls on it
until it is captured.

However, you should use your
Master Ball on either Cresselia
or Mesprit, so one of them
shouldn't be a problem to you.


--------------------------------
7) Route 209: Getting Spiritomb
--------------------------------

This sidequest gives you the
opportunity to capture yourself
a Spiritomb. If you look at
Route 209, you'll notice that it
arcs once. At the absolute very
bottom-right part of the bend,
there is a broken tower, which
looks like a hollow rock
structure.

At first you can't do anything
with it--not without an "Odd
Keystone". To get one, you will
have to either go to Hearthome
City and head west into Route
208, or head to Twinleaf Town.

As soon as you enter Route 208,
below the Berry Master's house
will be a Karate Guy hiding down
near some trees to the right of
some tall grass. He will give
you an Odd Keystone. At Twinleaf
Town there is another one,
hidden near the middle of the
left side of the pond as you
surf on it.

Go back to Route 209 and place
that Odd Keystone on the broken
tower, which you find out is
called the "Hallowed Tower", by
what is written on it.

Now here comes the tedious part.
You have to go underground, and
when you do so, you need to have
"met" thirty-two people.

Look at your Trainer Card while
Underground. You'll notice many
different statistics. One of
those statistics is "No. of
people met". That number needs
to be 32.

However, it's difficult to
understand what this means.
Basically, you have to go into
someone else's base while
they're in it and while their
base is open. You have to talk
with this person, though you
don't have to select any of the
options given to you such as
"Give Gift", "Greet", or
"Question".

However, you don't have to meet
32 _different_ people. In fact,
you can run in and out of your
same buddy's base 32 times and
speak to him or her 32 times in
a row. If you get your buddy to
stand one space away from his or
her base's entrance, it can
actually be a fast process.

After you have met 32 people,
return to the Hallowed Tower.

Save your game before you press
A on the Tower, for a level 25
Spiritomb will now attack you.
Every time you capture another
Spiritomb, it also will be at
level 25. Spiritomb is of the
Ghost/Dark-Type, which means
that it has no weaknesses. It
also has a 50% chance of being
male or female, and Spiritomb
eggs will hatch in 7,680 steps.
I caught it with one Quick Ball
at the beginning of the fight.

After your first fight, the
Tower will "crumble" again, even
though it has never changed how
it looked once. In order to have
the opportunity to capture
another Spiritomb, you need to
find another Odd Keystone.
Additional Odd Keystones can be
dug up in the Underground.
However, you unfortunately
_will_ be forced to see an
additional 32 people, but not 32
additional people since you put
in the odd keystone , in case
you had seen more than 32 since
you got your first Spiritomb. In
other words, no matter what, 64
is all you need for the second
Spiritomb to appear, and no
matter what, 96 is what you need
for the third, etc.


--------------------------------
8) Old Chateau: Getting Rotom
--------------------------------

In Eterna Forest, there is an
old building towards the back,
accessible only by cutting down
some bushes. Gardenia may be
standing near its entrance, and
will briefly talk about it
before leaving.

The only wild Pokemon inside the
building are low-level Gastly.
In the room straight ahead on
the first floor is an Antidote
in a trashcan to the back- left.
On the second floor, the first
room on the left has an Old
Gateau (which acts like a Full
Heal).

Also on the second floor, past
the door at the very north is a
hallway. In the room accessed
from the very left door of the
hallway is a Dread Plate for the
Arceus you don't have. TM90
(Substitute) is in the room on
the opposite side of that
hallway, to the very right.

There is a room, second door
from the very left in the
hallway, with a television in
it. If you press A on the
television at night and select
the option to "Thump" it, the
legendary Pokemon Rotom will
attack you at level 15. This
makes it the lowest-level
legendary Pokemon ever. You need
the National Pokedex, however,
for this to happen.

Rotom is of the Electric/Ghost-
Type, so Ghost and Dark-Type
moves are twice as effective
against it. Also, know that
Flying, Poison, Bug, Steel, and
Electric- Type moves' power is
halved when used against Rotom.
Normal, Fighting, and Ground-
Type moves are completely
ineffective against it.

Be very careful with it, since
it's at a low level. I caught it
with full health, merely
paralyzed, with my third Dusk
Ball. After you catch it, you
might as well leave.


--------------------------------
9) Battle Zone: Getting Heatran
--------------------------------

    =---------------------------
    =- a. Fight Area -=
    =---------------------------

After you beat the Elite Four,
an entire new region opens up to
you, called Battle Zone. To
access Battle Zone, head over to
Snowpoint City, where at the far
south of the place is a sailor
who will take you there.

As soon as you arrive, your
rival will give you his updated
plans of improving himself.
Someone named Buck will show up
while your rival is talking.
He'll challenge your rival's
claims of becoming the best, and
also bets that he'll reach the
treasure at the Volcano (Stark
Mountain) towards the north of
the Battle Zone before anyone
else. Your rival obviously
doesn't give a flip, because he
says that right now he'll be
heading to the Battle Tower.

Buck will then actually
introduce himself as Buck as
your rival leaves. Buck himself
will then leave, and that leaves
you to do whatever you want for
now.

At the Battle Zone, there's
quite a bit of new places to
explore. For now, I'll be
explaining about all there is to
see in the general area.

In this town, called Fight Area,
are people who might block your
path almost as soon as you have
reached the place if you don't
have the National Pokedex. You
won't be able to go any further
for now if you don't have at
least that. For details on the
National Pokedex, use Ctrl + F
to search for "2) National
Pokedex" in order to quickly go
to that section of this guide.

Anyway, at the very northwestern
part of the Fight Area is a
fisherman who will give you the
Super Rod. In the Pokemart in
the Fight Area is an older woman
who will give you the Scope
Lens, which boosts the holder's
critical-hit ratio.

In front of the entrance within
the Fight Area to the Battle
Park will be your rival on
weekends, every Saturday and
Sunday, ready to fight you with
his strengthened team. He'll
have level 60s, so be prepared.

    =---------------------------
    =- b. Battle Park -=
    =---------------------------

You access the Battle Park by an
entrance from the Fight Area.
Once you go inside the building
that leads towards Battle Park,
five receptionists will stop you
and give you a Point Card.
Everything that you might need
to know about the Battle Park
and everything within it can be
explained by the first three
receptionists.

Once inside the Battle Park,
there's a Razor Fang at the
bottom-left corner of the Park.
As soon as you walk in between
the two entrances of the
Exchange Service Corner on
either side of the road, "Tower
Tycoon" Palmer, who looks like
your rival's older brother, will
run into you just like him.
After he greets you, your rival
will run into you just like
Palmer. Both leave without
saying much.

Inside the Exchange Service
Corner, the left counter will
give you items for your Battle
Points and the right counter
will give you TMs for your
Points.

There are many prizes to be won
at the Battle Tower, but if you
manage to beat 100 matches in a
row, you'll earn a star for your
Trainer Card. Every so often,
like the 21st and 49th
consecutive battles, you will
face Tower Tycoon Palmer, who
has, by far, the strongest
Pokemon you'll face inside the
tower.

Lastly, for the Multi-Battles,
you may use any person you have
teamed up with in the game
before as a partner. That
includes Cheryl from Eterna
Forest, Mira from Wayward Cave,
Riley from Iron Island, Marley
from Victory Road, and Buck from
Stark Mountain. All of these
five people will use _much_
stronger Pokemon to help you out
in your Multi-Battles than what
they originally used. That about
covers what you need to know
about the Battle Park and Battle
Tower.

    =---------------------------
    =- c. Routes 230-229 and
       Resort Area -=
    =---------------------------

While you can immediately head
north to Route 225 towards the
Survival Area and towards Stark
Mountain, know that Heatran is
level 70, so let's procrastinate
as long as possible before you
head _way_ up into Stark
Mountain. From the Fight Area,
head east to Route 230. Remember
that if your path is blocked,
it's because you don't have the
National Pokedex.

Before you head into the water,
know that there are some Kelpsy
and Grepa Berries north from the
water. Go ahead and fight
everyone you can, as you will
need as much power as possible
to handle Heatran. However, I
still used repels. The first
couple of trainers can turn into
a Double Battle if you want it
to be one. Because such battles
take too long in my opinion, I
didn't make it so. You can just
talk to them separately if you
want to fight them that way.

Swimmer Sophia will start off
with a level 50 Mantyke, then
finish with a level 52 Mantine.
Swimmer Sam has a level 51
Chinchou (Water/Electric-Type),
and its evolved form, a level 51
Lanturn. Remember that Electric
attacks won't harm either of
Sam's Pokemon--I forgot...

The trainer who swims in
circles, Swimmer Glenn, has a
level 51 Seel (Water- Type) and
Starmie (Water/Psychic-Type). In
the small island north of Glenn
is a hidden Carbos to the north,
behind a breakable rock and a
visible Rare Candy in a Pokeball
to the east. Also in the small
island are quite a number of new
Pokemon to the Sinnoh region.

Past the small island are quite
a number of trainers. To the top
of the water route is Swimmer
Mallory, who has a level 50 Seel
(Water-Type) and level 54
Dewgong (Water/Ice-Type). Only
Fighting, Grass, Electric, and
Rock-Type moves are super
effective against the Dewgong.
Towards the middle of the water
route is Swimmer Joanna,
wielding a level 50 Luvdisc
(Water-Type) and level 54 Lapras
(Water/Ice-Type). Past Joanna is
Swimmer Kurt, who only has one
level 53 Crawdaunt (Water/Dark-
Type).

While you do technically cross
over into Route 229, you don't
have to do a thing there because
the path to the Resort Area to
the south completely bypasses
it. However, at Route 229 are
battles to be fought, items to
be collected (Protein/Big
Mushroom/Nugget/Full
Restore/Reaper Cloth), and new
Pokemon to be found. Spend as
much time there as you wish
before and after you visit the
Resort Area. Route 228 is to the
northwest from Route 229 by
land.

Once you get to the Resort Area,
you can do a couple of things.
To the very southeast part of
town is a visible Nugget inside
a Pokeball. Other than that,
there are berries to pick and
then there's the Ribbon
Syndicate.

When you enter the Ribbon
Syndicate, you'll need at least
one Pokemon on your team that
has 10 Ribbons or more if you
plan not to be kicked out. Once
you show them a Pokemon that has
at least 10 Ribbons, making you
a full-fledged member, you can
deposit that Pokemon and bring
anything you like from now on.

At the front counter are three
Ribbons up for sale. You first
have the option of paying for a
Gorgeous Ribbon for 10,000
Pokedollars. The Royal Ribbon
will then be sold for 100,000
Pokedollars. Lastly, a Gorgeous
Royal Ribbon will be sold for a
stupid 999,999--the maximum
amount of dough that you can
hold. If you ever purchase the
last one, the Ribbons sold will
recycle back to the Gorgeous
Ribbon. The biggest perk of
being a member is a free daily
spa treatment, on the second
floor, for one of your Pokemon.
The amount of happiness that
your Pokemon grows by from a spa
treatment is far greater than if
it was given a massage by the
girl at Veilstone City.

That's about all there is to do
around here. Now that you've
become more familiar with the
Battle Zone and now that you've
procrastinated a little longer,
you might as well fly back to
the Fight Area and head north to
Route
225.

    =---------------------------
    =- d. Route 225 and Survival
       Area -=
    =---------------------------

Now I could listen to this song
almost all day. If you rock
climb immediately to the left,
you'll find a visible HP Up in a
Pokeball. Immediately north is a
weird trainer set-up. So you
don't have to get yourself in a
needless Double Battle, press A
separately to the trainer on the
bottom-left and upper-right.
Bird Keeper Audrey to the
bottom-left has a level 52
Farfetch'd and level 54 Swellow.
Psychic Daisy to the upper-right
has a level 51 Slowpoke (Water/
Psychic-Type) and level 55
Slobro. PkMn Trainer Ashlee to
the upper-left has a level 50
Zigzagoon and level 56 Skarmory.
To the right of this immediate
area is a Rare Candy behind
shrubbery.

Now this area is over-the-top.
It'd be difficult for me to
explain exactly how you need to
pass this place, because the
trail is all over the place.
Luckily for you, it's a short
route distance-wise, and there's
only one direction to go. Just
know to run away from Raticate
(Normal-Type), as their Super
Fang move halves your Pokemon's
HP, or just use repels. The
basic direction is to climb high
and cross bridges to curve south
towards the left, where you'll
eventually reach a house, but
not before a couple of optional
trainer fights and a Revive.

Inside the house is a
construction worker who will
give you some Fresh Water. To
the left of the house behind
some shrubbery is something
called Lax Incense. If you give
that item to a female Snorlax
when you breed, instead of a
baby Snorlax hatching from the
egg, a baby Munchlax will. After
the house the route will become
more direct, so that will allow
me to walk you through the rest
of the route.

Up the slope next to the house
is a pond. If you surf across
the pond to the left, you will
reach a visible Dubious Disc
inside a Pokeball. That item
will evolve your Porygon2 into a
Porygon-Z. If you walk down the
grass path on the right side,
you won't have to fight Ace
Trainer Quinn's level 53 Pinsir
and Mightyena. Past him the path
is pretty straightforward until
you reach ground level, as in,
you're no longer on a rocky
elevation. To the left of the
slope that took you to ground
level is Ace Trainer Deanna with
her level 53 Flaaffy and Tropius
(Grass/Flying-Type). To the left
are some berries, most notably
the Tamato berry, behind some
shrubbery.

Heading to the right, opposite
of Ace Trainer Deanna, will do
you no good, as you might have
soon figured out if you had
traveled north a bit, above the
visible dead-end. Rock climbing
the wall on your way out nets
you a battle with Dragon Tamer
Geoffrey. He has a level 53
Dratini and level 55 Dragonair--
both pure Dragon-Type. Your
reward is the Dawn Stone behind
him. After all this is the
Survival Area.

At the Survival Area, a karate
man in the house at the very
bottom of the town will give you
TM42 (Facade). Why was there
only that one thing to do here?
You need to know that the only
reason there's a town called
Survival Area is so that you
have a resting place before you
go into the biggest wild area of
the entire game. Stark Mountain
is up ahead, so bring many
healing supplies as you head
east to Route 226.

    =---------------------------
    =- e. Routes 226-227 and
       Stark Mountain -=
    =---------------------------

For such a big area, I'm
thankful that the song for Route
225 carried over. If you take a
look at your map, you'll see
Route 228 at the far right. You
don't need to go there, and
because of that I won't walk you
through it. You can if you want
to, however, access that place
from Routes 226 or 229, but it's
optional anyway. Obviously there
are battles, TM37 (Sandstorm)
and other items, and Pokemon
like any other place. Know,
however, that there is a
constant Sandstorm in that area.
The Move Tutor is also there,
who teaches all four generations
of fully-evolved starter Pokemon
150 Att/90 Acc, 5 PP moves.

Back to route 226, if you rock
climb to the immediate north,
you can travel west back into
the Survival Area to a house.
Left of the house is a hidden
Max Revive. Inside the house is
a hiker with nothing to give. By
the way, use Max Repels. You
only have one healing stop at
Route 227. If you rock climb
back down, then to the south
rock climb back up, you can
fight Ace Trainer Graham's one
level 56 Skarmory. Below him two
platforms is a visible Carbos.
Above him are some berries.

Continue through the ups and
downs until you shortly get to
an optional, though dividable
Double Battle, but not before
you collect a visible Lagging
Tail inside a Pokeball along the
way. Bird Keeper Geneva has a
level 53 Golbat and level 57
Xatu. Dragon Tamer Stanley has a
level 56 Seadra and Gyarados.
Fighting them only nets you TM53
(Energy Ball). Down from them is
the ocean to the right. Inside
the grass that you can only
access by rock climbing, right
before you reach the ocean, is a
hidden TinyMushroom.

Once you hit the ocean, you have
the option of fighting Swimmer
Lydia's three Pokemon. She has a
level 52 Bibarel, Azumarill, and
Sealeo. Immediately south of
Lydia is a water path that takes
you to a hidden Big Pearl on
some beach. As you soon reach
land with a house on it, don't
miss the Pokedex upgrade from
the hiker inside the house.
After your Pokedex gains the
capability of reading Pokedex
entries of different languages
(basically, now a certain 14
foreign Pokemon's Pokedex
entries can be read in other
languages), the hiker will
afterwards give you the option
to trade him a Finneon for a
German Magikarp.

The list of the Pokemon that are
affected by this: Ekans/Pikachu/
Psyduck/Ponyta/Staryu/Magikarp/W
obbuffet/Heracross/Sneasel/ Tedd
iursa/Houndour/Wingull/Slakoth/R
oselia

Surfing the water path south of
the rocky barrier to the right
only takes you to one fight with
Swimmer Wade. He has two level
51 Carvanhas, and one level 54
Sharpedo. Surfing north from the
house will have you come across
a small inlet of land with a
hidden PP Up. Now surf the water
path above the rocky barrier to
the right to reach land again.
Soon you will have the option of
heading right to the completely
optional Route 228, or to head
north to Route 227 and
eventually to Stark Mountain.

Once you hit Route 227, you'll
immediately notice that volcanic
pumice and rock are falling--
while that won't ever stop from
here on, it won't affect your
battles. The first ramp requires
the top gear, fourth, of your
bike to cross over. Because
you'll be healing soon, I didn't
pass Ace Trainer Saul's one
level 55 Tauros. PkMn Ranger
Felicia's level 57 Lickitung and
Vigoroth are also optional
opponents. Jump down one, but
not two ledges, and then move
towards the left to eventually
come upon your rival and Gym
Leader Crasher Wake of Pastoria
City talking. After they talk
with you and leave, make sure
you heal inside the house before
you continue up the ramp.

After you heal up and walk up
the ramp, ride your bike like a
madman across the barely 1 foot-
wide log. As soon as you get to
the other side, Buck will talk
with you some more. If you want,
you can hop down the ledge to
your left and collect a Zinc
after you ride your bike back
across the other log. After this
you have to fight Ace Trainer
Mikayla, who wields a level 56
Meowth, Persian, and Hypno. If
you rock climb to the land down
below, you can pick up a visible
Charcoal to the right. After the
detour, heal again and head back
to where Buck was.

From where Buck stood, cross the
grass to the only place you can
go, and jump down two ledges.
Fight Black Belt Griffin, who
has a level 57 Cacturne (Grass/
Dark-Type) and Machamp. As you
head up into the actual Stark
Mountain, rock climbing to the
left nets you a visible Life
Orb, a hidden Protein which
makes you backtrack, and a
possible fight with Dragon Tamer
Darien's one level 60 Gyarados.

There is a visible Ether inside
of a Pokeball in the upper-right
corner of the grass field you
pass while heading left to
inside the mountain.

Once inside, push the boulder
first to the right, then _down_
the slope until it can go no
further. To the left from down
there is an Escape Rope, while
towards the right is an old
puzzle. Push two of the boulders
on either side of the one in the
middle right once, then push the
middle boulder either up or down
from the other side to get by.
When you get to the split, take
the southern one first for an
invaluable PP Up. Then travel
back the other way up a ramp to
the next elevation.

Push the boulder left to pass,
then move around towards the
left to pick up a Burn Heal.
Break the next rock to reach the
next level, but only push the
next boulder far enough for you
to get to the next slope, so you
don't close off the Full Restore
on the other side of the second
slope back down on the same
level. On your way through the
dark opening, your rival will
complain about having gotten
owned by Buck. Walk through the
dark opening.

In the next room, Buck will talk
about literally "owning" your
rival, and will then team up
with you. There are three points
of interest inside this gigantic
cave that I'll explain how to
get to.

If you're interested in a Flame
Plate for the Arceus you don't
have, walk left from the fork in
the path, then down the slope
above, then up the slope to the
left. Then walk forward to reach
a slope going down to the left
to find the hidden item at the
wall. Down from and to the north
of the plate is a Technical
Machine, as you should see a
visible Pokeball.

If you're interested in TM50
(Overheat), walk left from the
fork in the path at the
beginning, the down the slope
above. From there, walk north
completely, then move left,
pushing a boulder out of your
way, to get to a fight with Ace
Trainers Stefan and Jasmin, who
wield a level 57 Larvitar, level
59 Drapion (Poison/Dark-Type),
and level 57 Magcargo. Past them
is the TM.

In order to pass all unnecessary
crap and just get past the great
room, first start off going
right from the fork. Travel
north immediately (but not going
down the slope) by simply
breaking the rock on the higher
elevation, then continue going
up until you reach a slope going
down to the left. From there,
travel north for a short
distance, then immediately
travel west, breaking a rock
along the way. Afterwards,
travel up the slope going south
to run into the only mandatory
fight in the whole cave, pitting
you against Dragon Tamer Drake
and Black Belt Jarrett.

First up is a level 57 Vibrava
(Ground/Dragon-Type) and level
59 Machamp. A level 57 Seadra
replaces the Vibrava, and a
level 57 Dragonair replaces the
Seadra. From that fight, move
around left, then north, then
east, then down the slope. At
the bottom of the slope, push
the boulder across to the right
and out of your way so you can
go up the second slope. Once you
go up the slope, Buck will leave
you. Walk into the dark opening
and Buck will leave after you
talk to him.

From wherever you are, use an
Escape Rope. Once you are
outside of the cave, fly to the
Survival Area. Walk into the
house to the left of the Pokemon
Center to find Buck again. Buck
was apparently given a lecture
by the older man, as he says
that he'll put the Magma Stone
back where he found it. Now in
order to get the opportunity to
fight Heatran, you will have to
run all the way back up the
mountain the same way as last
time. The next time you reach
that room where Buck originally
got the Magma Stone, Heatran
will instead be there, waiting
for you.

Heatran won't attack first, so
get up to his face and save.
Note that you're inside a cave,
so no matter what time of the
day it is, you'll always get the
4x capture rate out of your Dusk
Balls.

Heatran, when you fight it, will
be at level 70. It is of the
Fire and Steel- Type, and it has
a 50% chance of being either
male or female. However, even if
you manage to get a male and
female Heatran, they will not
mate inside the Day Care Center
in order to perhaps produce
another one.

Ground-Type moves are 4x as
effective against it and
Fighting and Water-Type moves
are twice as effective against
it. Normal, Flying, Ghost,
Psychic, Dragon, and Dark-Type
moves are half as effective
against it, and Bug, Steel,
Grass, and Ice-Type moves only
do one-quarter as much damage to
it. Heatran is immune to Poison-
Type moves.

It has the moves Lava Plume (80
Spec. Att/100 Acc, a Fire-Type
move that may induce Burn),
Scary Face (which harshly lowers
your Speed), Fire Spin (15 Spec.
Att/70 Acc, a Fire-Type move
that traps your Pokemon for 2-5
turns), and Iron Head (80 Phy.
Att/100 Acc, a Steel-Type move
that may cause your Pokemon to
flinch).

Know that it took me three
restarts, using 30 Dusk Balls
the first two times, and then
catching Heatran with my 19th,
or should I say 79th, Dusk Ball.
After that, use another Escape
Rope and leave forever if you'd
like--you're done.
Congratulations on capturing
Heatran!


--------------------------------
10) Spring Path: Getting
    Giratina
--------------------------------

If you have beaten the Elite
Four and gotten the National
Pokedex, another rare Pokemon
becomes available for your
taking, called Giratina. Once
you have met the two
requirements, you'll notice on
your map a new area, called the
Spring Path. The Guide Map calls
it "The fourth lake of Sinnoh
that was kept secret." However,
you won't see a lake within the
spot on your map. Obviously
you'll need to access it from
Route 214, so go there.

When you arrive at Route 214,
preferably from Veilstone City,
travel halfway through it until
you see a new opening in the
forest to your right. Travel
through the path, continuing
into the new area, called
"Sendoff Spring".

I suggest you use repels for the
grassy field. Obviously climb
the rocky wall. Move around the
other side of this donut of a
structure and climb down into
the center of it. Walk into the
Turnback Cave. I strongly
suggest you get a Pokemon that
knows Defog--not because you're
worried about seeing well, but
because you don't want to miss
your attacks when you fight
Giratina.

As you enter, you'll notice a
pillar in front of you that
says, "...Past three
pillars...to the
sleeping...before 30 is
surpassed..." What that means is
that you have 30 tries to get
this puzzle right before the
puzzle resets. Don't worry--with
a little help, you can easily do
it in one try.

On the upper level of the room
you'll find four doorways. What
you're going to find frustrating
is that where it takes you is
not always the same place. When
you enter a door, you'll wind up
in one of three places--a room
with a lot of rocks all around
inside of it, the entrance from
the other side, or a room with a
pillar in the center. Walk into
the doorways until you find a
room with breakable rocks all
around.

What you're looking for is
irregularities in the rock
formations. Usually, in the
symmetrical rock formations, is
a rock out of place near one of
the doors. The door you need to
talk into is the one _opposite_
the odd one out--that means you
need to find the asymmetrical
formation, then choose the
correct formation on the other
side to advance. There are a
couple of formations that don't
follow this pattern, like this:
\ or ^ or / or < > or \ \ or / /
\      v      /

I honestly have no clue how
these work. I do know that I
successfully advanced by walking
up for the third formation. I
also went down for the second
formation, which turned out to
be successful. If you're having
problems, like the rest of the
world and myself, here's a good
rule of thumb: When in doubt,
don't go back the way you came
from.

Anyway, as you continue this
process, you'll eventually come
upon a pillar. When you read the
inscription on one of these
pillars, there'll be two
numbers. The top number shows
how many different pillars that
you've come across (you're
gunning for three, like the hint
at the entrance said), and the
bottom number shows how many
times you've failed. Remember
that you want less than 30. Any
higher than 30, and the top
number will reset along with the
bottom one, forcing you to find
three different pillars all over
again.

When you come across a pillar
and the top number says "3", it
won't matter what doorway you
take, as you will walk straight
into Giratina's chamber. My
bottom number was 12, just in
case you were curious. Walk up
to Giratina's face and save.
Press A to begin your fight with
this monster.

Giratina is at level 70 and is
of the Ghost/Dragon-Type. The
four moves of it are Slash (70
Phy. Att/100 Acc, Normal-Type
move with a high critical-hit
ratio), Earth Power (90 Spec.
Att/100 Acc, Ground-Type move
that may lower Spec. Def), Heal
Block [100 Acc, preventing you
from healing for 5 turns (you
can still use healing items,
however)], and finally, Shadow
Force (120 Phy. Att/100 Acc,
Ghost-Type move where Giratina
disappears the first turn and
attacks the next).

From this, you may or may not
have figured out that a
Normal/Flying-Type Pokemon like
Staraptor is immune to three out
of Giratina's four attacks.
Unfortunately, you won't be able
to use a Dusk Ball (which I hope
is the only thing you're using)
on this legendary while it has
disappeared.

It took me 18 Dusk Balls to
catch this beast.
Congratulations on capturing it!
When you're done, the
inscription behind the thing
reads, "This is...That where
life sparkles...That where life
has faded...A place where two
worlds overlap..." You don't
have to use an Escape Rope,
because any doorway will take
you to the entrance of Turnback
Cave. Notice that the
inscription on the wall in the
entrance has changed. Now it
reads "...Past three
pillars...offer up ...to
the...before 30 is surpassed..."

Interesting...whatever. Leave
this place forever--I know you
want to.


--------------------------------
11) Snowpoint Temple: Getting
    Regigigas
--------------------------------

There is one last rare Pokemon
you can get without the need of
a special Nintendo event-
acquirable item (it's something
else this time), and that is
obviously Regigigas. This
Pokemon is at Snowpoint City, in
the temple there, so go there.

Now you're going to be stopped
by a woman at the entrance. If
you've beaten the game and
gotten the National Pokedex,
instead of being turned away,
you'll be asked to leave...but
not before Candice of that
city's Gym will walk up and give
you permission. Apparently
Cynthia thinks you're good
enough--you are, so don't worry
about it. However, Regigigas,
when you do find it, won't fight
you unless you have its
subjects, the three Regis, from
Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire/ Emerald--
that's the something else--you
need them.

Doesn't that suck? Well...I
don't know what to tell you
other than don't bother
continuing unless you have those
three with you.

...have 'em? Good. Obviously in
the first room go down one
floor. In the next floor down
you can go ahead and pick up the
Calcium on the way down to the
next floor below. In the next
room, you can break the rocks if
you don't want to waste steps
for your repels.

In the room where it actually
takes skill to pass, start at
the very left side. Slide down
into the steel rock on the left
side of the ice, in the middle
of it. From there, slide right.
After that, slide up into the
rock on the right side of the
staircase, and then slide left
back into another steel rock.
Following, slide down onto the
only space without ice, then
slide right into a steel rock,
south into the back wall, west
into the left side, north into
the steel rock from the bottom
side, right all the way to the
other side of the room, then
north to where you need to go.

In the next room, you'll need to
push the boulder from below then
right over the icy pad in order
to make a stopping point. This
gives you access to the
NeverMeltIce inside the visible
Pokeball.

Up next is the last room, which
is obvious from the immediately
visible Regigigas. There is a
steel rock surrounded by icy
tiles close to the entrance. As
you stand on the normal ground
above the iciness, position
yourself one space to the west
of that steel rock. From there,
run south, sliding past that
steel rock on the right into a
non-icy space in the puzzle
below. Slide south into the
rock, then east into a steel
rock, then north onto another
non-icy space, then west into a
steel rock, south into yet
another steel rock, and then
finally east right into a steel
rock right in front of the
monster.

Don't worry about it
automatically attacking you, so
walk right up to it and save
directly in front of it. This
massive Pokemon is at level 70
and is of the Normal-type.

It's moves are Confuse Ray
(guess what it does), Superpower
(120 Phy. Att/100 Acc, Fighting-
Type move), Stomp (65 Phy.
Att/100 Acc, Normal-Type move
that may cause flinching), and
Zen Headbutt (80 Phy. att/90
Acc, Psychic-Type move that may
cause flinching). It's ability
"Slow Start" halves its Attack
and Speed for the first 5 turns
of battle.

While I didn't have the easiest
time whittling down its HP, I
caught it with my first Dusk
Ball (that's using only one,
ever) while it was in critical
health and paralyzed.
Congratulations for capturing
this Pokemon when you do. Use an
Escape Rope to get out of there
when you want to.

         {EXTRA STUFF}
--------------------------------
1) Poketch Applications
--------------------------------

The Poketch is an extremely

It is unfortunate that three of
the applications cannot be
obtained by any other way than
by cheating or waiting for some
Nintendo promotional event, but
until then you have 22 useful
applications to help you in your
adventure.

If you have any trouble
understanding how to work any of
these applications, go to the
third floor of the Poketch
Company building in Jubilife
City. When there, look at the
four different laptops in the
room to check explanations for
the different applications.


--------------------------------
2) National Pokedex
--------------------------------

In your game, there are
initially 150 Pokemon that can
be seen. In all Pokemon games,
the local professor would ask
you, the new trainer, to help
him collect data on all the
Pokemon of that region. In this
game Professor Rowan asks the
same thing, except in this game
you only have to see the 150
Pokemon--not capture them.

All Pokemon can be seen and many
can be caught before the game is
beaten at the League. However,
after the game has been beaten,
there isn't a whole lot more
that can be done until you have
gotten the National Pokedex.

As you may know it, there are
493 Pokemon in total. However,
your Sinnoh Pokedex only shows
data on 150 of them, even if you
have a Pokemon that isn't of
that 150. The National Pokedex,
which is an upgrade that shows
all Pokemon entries, can be
acquired by seeing the 150 in
the Sinnoh Pokedex.

After all that has been done,
you can go to Professor Rowan's
lab. When you show Professor
Rowan your Pokedex, he'll
congratulate you just as
Professor Oak from Kanto
suddenly walks in. Oak will then
proceed to upgrade your Pokedex.

Now, so much becomes available
with the National Pokedex. For
example, Pal Park and Fullmoon
Island.

After Professor Oak leaves,
Rowan will give you the Poke
Radar, which is used to detect
new kinds of Pokemon in normal
places.

After you get the National
Pokedex, your friend will be
standing outside of Professor
Rowan's lab and will give you
many helpful suggestions, such
as pointing you out to Bebe, the
person who manages the Pokemon
boxes (who will give you an
Eevee now that you have the
National Pokedex!). Bebe is in
the house east of the Pokemon
Center at Hearthome City, by the
way.


--------------------------------
3) Mystery Gift
--------------------------------

You might have known the Mystery
Gift option in previous Pokemon
games as Mystery Event. Mystery
Gift has been somewhat of a
widely known secret for a while
now. Basically, when the Mystery
Gift option is acquired in a
Pokemon game, you are enabled to
acquire free gifts from a
certain source, such as a
console Pokemon game.

In all games, the method
acquiring the option of "Mystery
Gift" has stayed the same. There
is always a certain person
somewhere in the game who, after
you do something else in the
game (like beat a Gym), will ask
you to give him some input about
whatever. The same method works
for this game.

In order to get the Mystery Gift
option, you must first go to
Jubilife City and walk into the
TV Station. Walk up two flights
of stairs to the third floor. On
the lower half of the room is a
man speaking to a woman.

When you talk to him, he'll ask
for some input about a couple
things. For the first pair of
words, using ABC mode to quicken
things up, put "EVERYONE HAPPY".
Answer "WI-FI CONNECTION" for
his second question.

After you've done this, save
your game. When you start up
your game, Mystery Gift will be
a permanent addition. If you
have a GBA Pokemon game inserted
and you can Migrate Pokemon, the
main menu will scroll to show
the Migrate option in between
Mystery Gift and Nintendo WFC
Settings.

Like the previous Pokemon games,
Mystery Gift is only useful if
Nintendo takes initiative and
creates a use for it, such as
receiving goodies for your
Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal from
Pokemon Stadium 2, or having the
ability to scan E- Reader cards
and receive goodies from Pokemon
Colosseum for your Pokemon Ruby/
Sapphire/Emerald games.


================================
[4] FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================

Have a question not addressed in
the guide?

Here, I have provided answers to
the some of the better questions
that I've been asked, as well as
to many others that I've been
most frequently questioned.

QUESTION: I'm going after the
8th Badge and I came upon a
painting in Mt.
  Coronet instead of the dark
  opening you said would be
  there.
ANSWER: This happens when you
haven't previously beaten Team
Galactic's
 Headquarters at Veilstone City.
 Use Ctrl + F and paste "b.
 Veilstone City" in a search to
 quickly go to that section of
 my guide.

QUESTION: I can't complete my
Sinnoh Pokedex because I can't
see Dialga/Palkia. ANSWER: In
order to see the other version's
exclusive legendary for your
Sinnoh
 Pokedex, you'll need to visit
 Cynthia's grandmother in
 Celestic Town. She is in the
 biggest building at the top of
 the Town and she'll show you a
 picture of what you need to see
 after you've dealt with your
 version's exclusive legendary
 in the game.

QUESTION: People are blocking my
path at the Battle Zone. When
will they leave? ANSWER: The
people who block you from
advancing almost as soon as you
reach the
 Battle Zone only leave once
 you've gotten the National
 Pokedex. For further details,
 use Ctrl + F and paste "2)
 National Pokedex" in a search
 to quickly go to that section
 of my guide.

QUESTION: How did you obtain all
three starter Pokemon like that?
ANSWER: It's very simple. I
chose one starter, went to
Sandgem and traded it to
 another person's game, and then
 restarted my own game. I
 repeated this process one time,
 and after having started a
 third game, received the first
 two starters that I traded
 away. While this seemingly
 makes the game easier, it's
 actually just as hard (at least
 for the first half of the game)
 because you have to deal with
 two major Pokemon on your team
 that won't listen to you most
 of the time for a long while.


================================
[5] CONTACT INFORMATION
================================

At this point you probably don't
want to contact me asking
questions about this game,
because since my Nintendo DS
Lite has been mysteriously
smashed, I no longer can play
the game myself. This means that
I can no longer stay familiar
with the game, and thus, be able
to answer any questions you
might have. Sorry about this.
The best thing you can do if
you're still confused over
something is go to the Pokemon
Diamond or Pearl General Message
Boards at GameFAQs to ask your
question(s) there, or consult
other guides at GameFAQs.

If you still want to contact me
knowing that, you can do so by
e-mail. However, please make
sure that you've read the
section of my guide that your
question(s) is(/are) concerned
with. Furthermore, please read
the Frequently Asked Questions
section of the guide to see if
your question(s) has(/have) been
asked before as well.

You can contact me, L255J, by
e-mail. If you would like to
e-mail me, I'm

================================
[8] WHAT TO EXPECT IN FUTURE
UPDATES
================================

Nothing. Sorry about that. I
came home from college one
evening to find that my Nintendo
DS Lite had been broken in half
by someone. Unfortunately, I
don't know who it was, and I
have no plans to buy myself yet
another Nintendo DS Lite at this
point.

This means that there's no way
for me to confirm any
corrections or suggestions made
by anyone through e-mail. Though
I was patiently waiting for the
rare Pokemon to be released
through promotions and then
write about them in my guide
along with other material,
obviously I cannot do that now.
