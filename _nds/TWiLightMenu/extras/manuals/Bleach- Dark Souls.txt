This FAQ is meant to serve as a
translation and gameplay guide
for Treasure and Sega's Bleach
DS 2nd: Kokui Hirameku Requiem.
I intend to cover everything
required to play the game
competently and unlock all
characters and features, but I
will not be providing either a
detailed story translation or
in-depth strategy for any single
character in this guide, though
I may be writing a few separate
guides for individual characters
later.

I will likely be participating
in Bleach DS 2nd threads at
GameFAQs and platformers.net, as
well as discussing the game at
the quasi-official Bleach DS IRC
channel as I add more

„  SECTION I: WHAT'S NEW SINCE
BLEACH DS 1ST? „ 
„¤-------------------------------

Bleach DS 2nd is mostly an
expansion and refinement of the
original Bleach DS. The basic
gameplay system is mostly
unchanged, all of the non-
duplicate characters have
returned, several more have been
added to the roster, and various
tweaks have been made here and
there.

While the move sets for each of
the returning characters are
mostly similar with a few new
specials added here and there,
the control behavior for most of
them have changed drastically. A
lot of infinite combos are gone;
those that remain are harder to
pull off. Most non-RF specials
have much greater start-up or
cool-down time, making it
particularly difficult to combo
to or from some of them. If
you've put a lot of time into
mastering any particular
characters in the original game,
you'll likely have to change
your strategy and relearn a few
things to get yourself up to
speed in the sequel.

Most of the changes to specific
characters are for balance
purposes. Just about every
significant issue present in the
original game has been
addressed. Kenpachi no longer
has infinite teleport ability or
stackable Super A. Aizen's
fireball normals have been
replaced with sword techniques
and his specials now have RF
variations. Soifon's crouching
kick and ninja summons have been
nerfed considerably. Uryu's
Ransoutengai is now an RF
technique, and he can't string
as many arrow volleys together
at once. Yachiru's normal
attacks are slower and she
occasionally trips on her own.
Unfortunately, some characters
who didn't need to be nerfed
were made weaker anyway. Orihime
now takes 1.5x damage, for
example.

While a good number of new
characters in Bleach DS 2nd
mostly seem to have been added
for the purpose of padding the
Story Mode with generic opponent
characters, those who do stand
out among them add a lot of
variety to the roster. Iduru has
a number of command throws and
counter techniques. Rangiku has
some nice ash cloud setups. Don
Kanonji is a better fighter than
he has any right to be. Some
characters who had sparse
movesets in the original Bleach
DS have been upgraded. Hollow
Ichigo now has a unique moveset.
Nemu, Yachiru, Tatsuki, and Kon
have a little more variety in
special attacks now. Bonnie has
normal attacks.

You can now see your opponents'
reiryoku gauges. You can no
longer use flash steps to pass
through enemy RF specials. You
can no longer damage cancel out
of a super during the moment it
is cast, which makes for a much
more aggressive pace to battles
in particular. Throws can now be
performed in mid-air but are now
more difficult to perform; they
require two button presses and
more precise positioning.
Several hitboxes have been
modified; most attacks that used
to hit in front and behind the
player simultaneously no longer
do so. Some super attacks now
vary in behavior depending on
what button is pressed to
perform them.

Steps have been taken to prevent
touch screen abuse. You must
wait a few seconds after using a
special attack hotkey in order
for it to become active again.
You cannot use guard cancel
techniques via the touch screen.
The reifu system has been
overhauled and the most abused
cards have been thrown out
altogether.

The story mode in Bleach DS 2nd
appears to be a non-canon
sidestory that takes place at
the end of the Soul Society arc
of the series. It contains
several minigame-esque stages,
some pseudo-sidescrolling beat-
em-up stages, and fights against
hollows who are also playable
characters themselves. The Wi-Fi
versus mode has been improved.
You can now rematch opponents
after each fight, add them to
your rivals list without
obtaining their code, leave
messages for others on your
friend/rival list, play card-
less ranking matches, and play
special event matches held by
Sega periodically. Challenge
Mode has not made a return. Time
Attack Mode is now 6 stages
instead of 20. You regain some
life in Survival Mode after each
match now, which makes it
considerably easier.

only character from Bleach DS 1
who does not appear in Bleach DS

Komamura. This isn't
particularly noteworthy, as he
played identically to the

„  GAMEPLAY SCREENS „ 
„¤------------------„£

- TOP SCREEN -

SOUL (°é®) GAUGE This is the blue
life bar at the top of the
screen.

REIATSU (—ìˆ³) GAUGE This is the
green bar beneath your life
gauge, which fills up as you
attack your enemy and increases
your reiatsu stock count by 1
when filled.

REIATSU (—ìˆ³) STOCK Three white
markers next to your reiatsu
gauge keep track of your current
Reiatsu stock. You can hold up
to 3 reiatsu stock in reserves,
which are required to perform
super moves and damage cancels.

REIFU (—ì•„) EFFECT Reifu are the
spirit cards used during battle
to power-up your character or
power-down your opponents. A
colored icon will appear beneath
your life gauge when your
character is currently under the
effect of a card. This color
indicates the type of effect,
which matches the color of the
card used. For more information
on reifu and their effects, see
the reifu section below.

REIRYOKU (—ì—Í) GAUGE This is the
three-segmented bar at the
bottom of the screen, which
fills up automatically over
time. Reiryoku is required to
perform RF specials and use
flash steps. Using flash steps
depletes the inner gauge only,
while using RF specials depletes
both the inner and outer gauges.
The inner gauge restores itself
more quickly than the outer
gauge, but the inner gauge will
only restore itself as long as
the outer gauge is at an equal
or greater level. In other
words, the inner gauge can never
be larger than the outer gauge.
In Bleach DS 2nd, reiryoku
gauges for both you and your
opponents are always visible.

TIME LIMIT Located at the top of
the screen between the players'
life bars.

- TOUCH SCREEN -

REIFU (—ì•„) STOCK This is the
number at the top of the screen
that indicates how many reifu
you have left in reserves.

REIFU (—ì•„) BUTTONS These are the
spirit cards, which are
activated upon touch. Four of
these are available at any one
time. For more information on
reifu, check the Reifu/Reiju and
Deck Construction sections
below.

SPECIAL HOTKEYS Blue hotkeys are
shortcuts for specials. Red
hotkeys are shortcuts for
supers. Using the hotkeys for
command input instead of the
face buttons prohibits you from
choosing the variation
(light/medium/heavy) of that
technique during battle. They
will always perform the heavy/RF
version.

PLAYER EMBLEMS Each player's
custom emblem will appear at the
top-right corner of the touch
screen.

There does not appear to be a
way to alter the layout of the
touch screen in Bleach DS 2nd.

WALK & TURN: left/right JUMP: up
CROUCH: down DASH: left/right
twice; 2nd press can be held
down AERIAL DASH: left/right
twice in mid-air DOUBLE JUMP: up
while in mid-air FLASH STEP: B
button (can be changed in
options, uses 1/3 of reiryoku
gauge) LINE CHANGE: L button
(can be changed in options)

FOREGROUND AND BACKGROUND
FIGHTING PLANES Movement in
Bleach DS 2nd takes place on two
individual 2D fighting planes.
Attacks performed on one plane
will not interfere with the
action on the other plane. You
can switch planes at any time by
pressing the line change button.
In this game, it is possible to
hit opponents as they are
changing planes, and you can
change the game's settings so
that you and your opponent
cannot change planes during
battle.

FLASH STEPS / SHUNPO Flash steps
are used to quickly teleport in
any direction, and most
characters are invulnerable to
opponents when they perform this
technique. You can use flash
steps to teleport through or
away from enemy attacks, travel
a longer distance quickly, link
normal attacks that normally do
not chain together, or position
yourself in the air for a quick
overhead attack. Most characters
will briefly be vulnerable to
attack after completing a flash
step; you won't have time to
block an enemy's attack if you
flash step into it. Flash steps
also use up one segment of your
inner reiryoku gauge. Some
characters do not have proper
flash steps but instead have a
comparable quick step that
provides many of the same
functions. These characters may
be completely visible to
opponents when performing the
technique or not be able to use
it in mid-air. In Bleach DS 2nd,
you cannot use flash steps to
pass through your enemy's RF
special attacks. Attempting to
do so will still cause you to
get hit.

MOVEMENT BEHAVIOR AND RULES
Walking speed, dashing speed,
and flash step distance vary
between individual characters.
For most characters, up to one
double jump and two aerial
dashes can be performed in mid-
air before returning to the
ground. These aerial movement
techniques can be linked
together in any manner.

- DEFENSE -

GUARD: R button (can be changed
in options) GUARD CANCEL: flash
step / special while guarding
DAMAGE CANCEL: any attack button
+ flash step when enemy strikes
(uses reiatsu)

GUARDING Guarding nullifies
damage from enemy attacks and
also prevents you from being
staggered. Most attacks still
inflict a small amount of chip
damage to guarding opponents,
however. A standing guard blocks
standing and aerial attacks but
is vulnerable to crouching
attacks and throws. A crouching
guard blocks standing and
crouching attacks but is
vulnerable to aerial attacks and
throws. An aerial guard blocks
aerial, standing, and crouching
attacks but is vulnerable to
aerial throws. Guarding can
either be performed with the
guard button or by moving in the
opposite direction of an enemy
attack.

GUARD CANCELING In a normal
guarding state, you can not
perform any action besides
standing/crouching. When an
enemy attack hits your character
while you are guarding, however,
a small blue circle will quickly
appear, expand, and vanish.
While this circle is visible,
you can perform either a flash
step or a special/super attack
while you are guarding. This
technique is called a guard
cancel, and it is one of the
most vital techniques to learn
in order to play competitively.
In Bleach DS 2nd, you cannot
perform guard cancel techniques
with the touch screen.

DAMAGE CANCELING A damage cancel
can be performed to break free
from normal enemy attacks,
special moves, and stuns. To
perform this technique,
simultaneously press the flash
step button plus any normal
attack button while your
character is being attacked.
(Using a reifu while in a
damaged state also performs a
damage cancel.) The aura that
surrounds your character during
a damage cancel will inflict 1
hit point of damage to any enemy
character that it touches.
Damage canceling requires 1
reiatsu stock to perform and
cannot be used against super
moves or after a wallbounce.
Unlike Bleach DS 1, you cannot
DC at all after an enemy has
started to perform a super move,
even if it hasn't quite hit your
character yet.

- OFFENSE -

LIGHT ATTACK: Y button (can be
changed in options) MEDIUM
ATTACK: X button (can be changed
in options) HEAVY ATTACK: A
button (can be changed in
options) THROW: two attack
buttons simultaneously
SPECIALS/SUPERS: varies between
characters; check command list /
use hotkeys REINFORCE SPECIALS:
strongest variation of special
attacks, always executed
     with strong attack button, 
gauge and abbreviated with "RF"

STRIKING NORMAL ATTACKS There
are three different levels of
normal attacks (light, medium,
and heavy), which have their own
dedicated buttons and can be
chained together in various
ways. The behavior of normal
attacks changes depending on
whether your character is in a
standing, crouching, or aerial
state. Light attacks are weaker
and faster; heavy attacks are
stronger and slower.

THROWS Throws can be performed
when you are positioned next to
an opponent. They normally don't
cause much damage, but they will
often put your opponent into a
flying or stunned state, which
can be useful for setting up
additional attacks. If you walk
or flash step out of range of an
opponent at the very same moment
he attempts to throw you, the
throw will fail and the enemy
character will briefly enter a
tripping/kneeling animation. If
you strike an opponent at the
same moment he attempts to throw
you, or if both characters
attempt to throw each other at
the same time, they will both be
knocked back from each other.
Throws can be performed in mid-
air in Bleach DS 2nd.

SPECIAL ATTACKS, REINFORCED
SPECIAL ATTACKS, AND SUPER
ATTACKS Each character has a
variety of unique special moves
and super moves, which can
either be performed by specific
button combinations (listed in
the pause menu) or by using the
touch screen hotkeys. Blue
hotkeys are for specials, and
red hotkeys are for supers.

Like normal attacks, many
special moves vary in strength,
speed, and behavior depending on
which attack button you use.
Specials performed with the
light attack button are usually
quick but have a long recovery
time. Those performed with the
medium attack button are usually
slow but have a quick recovery
time. Those performed with the
heavy attack button often
combine the best of both worlds.
The strongest of these three
variations are usually
reinforced (RF) special moves.
Performing RF specials uses up
one segment of your outer
reiryoku gauge and will cause
your character to glow yellow
for a short period of time. In
Bleach DS 2nd, you can use RF
specials to intercept an
opponent in the middle of a
flash step. If your reiryoku
gauge is empty, attempting to
perform an RF special will
result in the use of a weaker
variation of that special
instead. Some special moves are
RF-only and cannot be performed
if you don't have enough
reiryoku.

You can use the touch screen to
perform special moves instead of
the buttons, but you will always
use the heavy/RF variation of
the special when doing so. If
you use a special attack with
the touch screen, you will have
to wait a few seconds before you
can perform it with the touch
screen again.

Super moves are typically the
strongest attacks available to
your character. In Bleach DS
2nd, super moves also vary in
behavior depending on what
button is used to perform them.
Every super in the game requires
either 1 or 3 reiatsu stock to
perform.

„¡-----------------------„¢
„  TIPS & BASIC STRATEGY „ 
„¤-----------------------„£

BREAKING GUARD AND MIXING
STANDING/CROUCHING/AERIAL
ATTACKS A standing guard blocks
standing and aerial attacks. A
crouching guard blocks standing
and crouching attacks. An aerial
guard blocks all normal attacks.
A standing throw can be used to
break a standing or crouching
guard, and an aerial throw can
be used to break an aerial
guard. Make sure to mix up your
attacks to keep a guarding
opponent guessing as to what he
should block. You can flash step
directly above your opponent and
attack in order to perform a
quick aerial hit.

CHIP DAMAGE Most attacks still
inflict a small amount of damage
on a guarding opponent. Unlike
Bleach DS 1, most normal attacks
inflict chip damage as well
instead of just specials and
projectiles. Make use of this to
KO opponents at low health.

CHAIN COMBOS If a normal attack
hits your opponent, you can
immediately follow it up with a
stronger attack to perform what
is called a chain combo. For
most characters, you cannot
follow a medium or heavy attack
with an attack of equal or
lesser strength. You can usually
follow a standing medium or
heavy with a crouching medium or
heavy, though. You can also use
certain techniques to link
attacks together that would not
work normally. The most common
way of doing so is using flash
steps to link normal attacks
together. For example, most
characters can perform a simple
light -> medium -> heavy attack
combo, but this combo cannot be
followed by another normal
attack in most cases. If you
perform a flash step immediately
after the heavy attack, however,
you can then immediately follow
it with any attack of your
choosing, allowing for much
longer combos.

LAUNCHERS AND AERIAL COMBOS Most
characters have at least one
attack that will send their
opponent airborne. Such
techniques are called launchers,
and they can usually be followed
by a jump and additional hits.
Since jumping and double jumping
require no power from either
special gauge, chain combos
performed in mid-air can often
provide more hits than standing
combos by themselves.

CHAIN COMBO DAMAGE SCALING As
the number of hits in a single
combo increases, the damage that
each successive hit inflicts
decreases. Most light attacks
inflict 4 damage, most mediums
6, and most heavies 8 by
themselves. A typical light ->
medium -> heavy chain combo,
however, inflicts only 15 damage
total. This can make certain
combos involving multiple super
moves less appealing; it would
usually be more cost-effective
reiatsu-versus-damage-wise to
perform 2 super moves separate
from each other than it would to
perform both of them in the same
combo. Of course, it can also be
beneficial to combine multiple
supers together if you are
guaranteed a hit after the first
super. This is a risk-versus-
reward scenario that you have to
evaluate yourself depending on
the situation.

LOW HEALTH DAMAGE SCALING
Attacks cause more damage
against opponents at full health
than they cause against
opponents at low health. Each
character has 255 hit points
total, and for most characters,
heavy attacks inflict 8 points
of damage. Without damage
scaling, it would take 32
individual heavy hits to KO an
opponent, but in actuality it
takes 46 hits to do so. Be
careful when budgeting your
supers against an opponent at
low health, as they may be able
to take more punishment than you
expect.

DAMAGE TABLES The following is a
complete list of all characters
who have different defense
levels than the rest of the
roster, rounded to the nearest
percentage point. Characters
with 50% defense would receive
exactly 2x damage from enemy
attacks.

Komamura    - 115%
ogihcI      -  73%
Yachiru     -  67%
Hanataro    -  67%
Ururu       -  67%
Orihime     -  62%
Shrieker    -  57%
Tatsuki     -  50%
Goteitaishi -  50%
Kon         -  47%
Ririn       -  47%
Tsukaima    -  47%
Kyugohanin  -  47%
Shibata     -  47%

JUGGLE STATES AND OFF-THE-GROUND
(OTG) HITS In most cases, an
opponent hit in mid-air will
quickly recover from stun and be
able to move or counter-attack
while still in the air. Some
moves will force the opponent to
fall to the ground after being
hit, and they cannot move or be
hit until they fully recover
from their fall. Being thrown
into a wall will cause them to
bounce off of the wall, leaving
them unable to move but open to
further attacks. When you strike
an opponent after a wallbounce,
it will normally keep him in an
aerial state and push him
slightly upwards, forcing you to
jump and flash step after him in
order to continue a combo.
However, if you strike him just
as he initially hits the ground,
it will put him into a standing
state, which allows you to
proceed with a standing combo
more easily. This technique is
known as an off-the-ground hit,
and the timing window for it is
very strict.

INSTANT AERIAL DASH (IAD) An IAD
is a jump immediately followed
by an aerial dash. To perform an
IAD, jump diagonally and then
quickly press forward on the
D-pad. This allows you to stay
close to the ground while
inputting aerial attacks, which
allows you to create longer
combos. A common IAD combo is
IAD -> aerial medium -> aerial
heavy. The heavy attack will
keep the opponent stunned long
enough for you to land and
continue a standing combo

GROUND-TO-AIR FLASH STEP (TAFS)
COMBOS When performing a chain
combo against a standing
opponent, you can usually
increase the amount of damage by
flash stepping above them,
inputting a few aerial attacks,
landing, inputting some standing
attacks, and then flash stepping
again. For example, when
attacking an opponent with
Ichigo, instead of inputting
[standing light -> standing
medium -> standing heavy ->
flash step forward -> repeat],
try [standing light -> standing
medium -> standing heavy ->
flash step diagonally above
opponent -> aerial medium ->
aerial heavy -> land -> repeat].
The basic idea of th add aerial
attacks to ground combos.

BALANCING YOUR REIATSU METER
Reiatsu is used for two
techniques: super attacks and
damage cancels. It is usually a
good idea to keep at least 1
reiatsu stock in reserve for
damage cancels should you need
them. For some characters,
1-stock supers can be more cost-
effective than 3-stock supers if
preceded or followed by certain
combos, so building your meter
up to 3-stock and keeping it
there can be a little wasteful
since any additional normal
attacks will not add any more
reiatsu to the meter until you
use some of it first.

BALANCING YOUR REIRYOKU METER
Reiryoku is used for two
techniques: flash steps and RF
special attacks. Flash steps use
up the inner gauge, which
refills rather quickly, while RF
specials use up the outer gauge,
which refills much more slowly.
Your inner gauge can never
extend further than the outer
gauge. For example, if you
perform 2 flash steps while both
parts of the gauge are maxed
out, you will deplete the inner
gauge by 2/3, while the outer
gauge will still be full. If you
perform 2 RF specials while both
parts are maxed out, however,
both the inner and outer gauges
will be reduced by 2/3. Using RF
specials in quick succession can
be rather wasteful, as it will
drastically limit your ability
to perform flash steps and
combos that require them.

„  REIFU (—ì•„) & REIJU (—ìì) „ 
„¤-----------------------------„£
Reifu are the spirit cards used
during battle to power-up your
character and power-down your
opponents. Reiju are stat
modifiers. You can earn some of
them by clearing stages in Story
Mode for the first time. The
rest can be purchased in the
Urahara Shop. You can create up
to 5 custom decks in Deck
Construction mode and then
select which one of them to use
when you begin a battle. Check
the Deck Construction section
below to learn how to create
your own custom decks.

During a fight, two thirds of
your deck will be randomly
selected and available for use
throughout the match. Four cards
will be available for use at any
one time; just press them to
activate them. Each card has 4
different things displayed on
them:
  REIFU NAME: Japanese text on t
  DECK COST: Small number at bot
   number of total points for ea
  USE COST: Up to 4 blue boxes a
   cannot have more than 4 blue 
   If you use a 2-box card, you 
   or two 1-box cards until the 
   card, you can't use any other
TARGET: The symbol at the
bottom-right corner of each card
indicates who that card affects.
    blue triangle = yourself
    1 red triangle = 1 enemy
 2 red triangles = all enemies
   gold A = all players
   white N = no one (usually a s

After you use a reifu, you have
to wait a short period of time
before the effect becomes
active. If you're hit before the
reifu activates, it won't have
any effect.

„  SIMPLE MODE (ŠÈˆÕ‘€ìƒ‚[ƒh) „ 
„¤------------------------------„£
When setting up the game, there
will be an option to change the
control method from Manual to
Auto. Auto activates Simple
Mode, which has the following
features:

AUTOMATIC CHAIN COMBO This
feature strings attacks together
whenever possible. For an
example of how this works, start
Training Mode with Ichigo in
Manual mode. Walk up next to
your opponent and quickly press
the light attack button 3 times
in succession. You will strike
him with 3 light attacks. Now
return to the Character Select
screen and change the control
method to Auto. Walk up to your
opponent and quickly press the
light attack button 3 times once
more. Ichigo will use the light
attack -> medium attack -> heavy
attack chain combo instead. Auto
chain combo will attempt to use
the most damaging variation of
your command when you are
guaranteed to hit the enemy. Be
aware, however, that this limits
the number of custom combos you
can discover and execute on your
own. Auto chain combo isn't
recommended for advanced players
or anybody who wants to be truly
competitive.

AUTOMATIC GUARD This feature
will cause your character to
automatically guard whenever
possible. Only your opponents'
counter attacks will
successfully connect. Attacks
blocked with auto guard will
cause orange blockstun circles
to appear instead of blue ones.

MAJORITY RULE allows each player
to vote for game settings. Any
ties are decided by whoever
votes last. DESIGNATE RULES
allows the creator of the room
to determine all match settings
in advance. DEATHMATCH is a
standard fight-to- the-death
battle. In POINTMATCH, you get a
point for each bit of damage you
inflict on an enemy and lose
points every time you get hit
yourself. 1 LINE and 2 LINE
allows you to prohibit or permit
movement between the foreground
and background fighting planes.
The REIFU options determine
whether deck use is allowed or
not.

„¡-------------------------------
„  SECTION V: STORY MODE
(ƒXƒg[ƒŠ[ƒ‚[ƒh) „ 
„¤-------------------------------
If this is your first time
playing Story Mode, you'll be
presented with the opening scene
and then will start off with
Yoruichi's training mission.
After playing once, choosing
Story Mode from the main menu
will give you the following
options:

‚Í‚¶‚ß‚©‚ç    NEW GAME
‚Â‚Ã‚«‚©‚ç    CONTINUE
ƒtƒŠ[ƒ‚[ƒh  FREE MODE

Choosing Continue will resume
the game wherever you left it.
Choosing New Game will kick you
back to the very beginning of
Part A. You can skip stages that
you've already cleared, however.

After you clear Ending 1,
choosing New Game will allow you
to skip to the beginning of each
of the 4 areas in Story Mode (A,
B, C, and D). Free Mode will
also become available at this
point. In Free Mode, you can
skip directly to any stage
you've already cleared and play
them with any character of your
choosing. You can't access any
new areas in Free Mode or work
towards completion percentages
on difficulties you haven't
played yet, however.

When selecting which of the 4
parts of the game you want to
play (after you've already
gotten 1 ending), completion
ratings will appear at the top
of the screen. These indicate
how many stages you've cleared
for each area on each
difficulty. Some characters,
system voice sets, and money are
unlocked and rewarded to you
whenever each of these ratings
reaches 100%. The most hassle-
free way to unlock all
characters is to get 100%
completion for each part on Easy
mode. The only thing that
changes on Normal and Hard is
the amount of money rewarded,
and since you get a very large
bonus (800000) for completing
EVERY stage on EVERY difficulty
(in addition to smaller bonuses
for completing each individual
part on each individual
difficulty), you'll have to play
Easy mode anyway if you want to
earn a lot of money quickly. The
touch screen will display a
selection of parts A through D
(‚`ƒp[ƒg, ‚aƒp[ƒg, etc). If FULL OPEN
is displayed to the right of any
of them, it means you have
access to every stage in that
area but have not completed
everything on all difficulties.
If COMPLETE is displayed, it
means that you are entirely
finished with that area.

The easiest way to check and see
which stages you haven't cleared
on a particular difficulty is to
view the map in Free Mode. Three
red boxes will be displayed
below each stage on the map, and
these correspond to Easy,
Normal, and Hard from left to
right. If a box is lit up, it
means that that stage has been
cleared on that difficulty.

When playing through the story
in regular mode (not Free Mode),
any stage that you've cleared
previously (either in the
current playthrough or in a
previous one) will be outlined
in blue on the map. Stages that
you haven't cleared yet will be
outlined in red. You can skip
any stage with a blue outline,
but I recommend that you play
them repeatedly until you clear
each of them on each difficulty.

You can skip messages and by
either pressing start or holding
the down button on all of the
cutscenes. Use the down button
to do so, or else you'll fail to
unlock all of the gallery
artwork. (After you've viewed a
scene once, however, there's no
harm in skipping it with the
start button the next time you
play it.) While on the map
screens, press Y to change
options, B to return to the main
menu, or X to zoom in and out.

When you begin a stage, you'll
have the following options
available to you:

“ïˆÕ“x            DIFFICULTY

You can create reifu/reiju decks
in Deck Construction mode and
specify which one to use in
Story Mode with the deck slot
select option. Various reifu,
reiju, and deck frames can be
earned through completing stages
in Story Mode for the first time
and by purchasing them in the
Urahara Shop. Super attack
animations are the long
cutscenes that play when certain
characters use their 3-stock
transformation super moves
during a fight. Specifying Auto
under Control Method activates
Simple Mode.

„¡-------------„¢
„  WALKTHROUGH „ 
„¤-------------„£
The following guide has been
written according to Hard mode.
Some of the requirements are
more forgiving on easier
difficulties (such as a greater
time limit, fewer opponents to
defeat, or less-powerful
opponents). It's also written
without taking deck strategy
into play. I haven't messed
around with the reifu system in
this game yet, but I have
cleared everything on Story
Mode, so I can assure you that
everything here is very doable
without decks.

That said, I imagine that a few
stages would be much easier with
certain cards. In a few stages,
you either have to switch planes
more than your opponent or catch
them and hit them a few times,
and they'll be running away and
switching planes at a very fast
rate. A Prohibit Line Change
reifu (purple, ƒ‰ƒCƒ“ˆÚ“® ‹Ö~) would
likely help immensely for these
missions. I believe there is
also a reifu that stops the
timer, and this would probably
come in handy for any stage with
a time limit. I'm not sure which
one this is; it might be the
very last one listed in the last
category of cards in the shop,
but I haven't tested it to
verify.

Each part of this guide will
consist of a map, a quick list
of all the stages displayed on
that map, and some in-depth
information for a few stages.
The map is formatted with Shift-
JIS characters; sometimes
Internet Explorer fails to
display the spacing correctly,
so you might have to use a
different browser to properly
view them. Each stage in the
list will be displayed as
follows:

#) type - portrait - objective -
unlock

Type indicates what symbol
appears at the bottom left
corner. Two swords crossed
indicates a battle, a flame
indicates a mission with special
win conditions, and a hollow
mask usually indicates a battle
with hollows. The portrait
indicates what character(s) are
identified for that stage on the
map. The objective is what must
be done to complete the stage.
Each stage will reward you with
some money when you clear it,
and clearing each stage for the
first time usually gives you
access to a reifu, reiju, or
deck frame. Clearing some stages
for the first time will unlock
certain characters, and these
will be listed below.

Play stages 5 and 12 as soon as
they become available, as it's
possible to lose access to them
later. Play stage 21 only after
clearing everything else on the
map, as it prevents you from
going back to previous areas
after you clear it.

STAGE 1 - [MISSION] TRAINING
WITH YORUICHI When you begin
Story Mode, Yoruichi will run
you through the game basics.
Just skip through the messages
and follow the instructions that
appear on the bottom of the
screen. Here is a translation of
the ones that appear in
Japanese:

ƒWƒƒƒ“ƒv’†‚É while jumping —§‚¿’†‚É while
standing ‚µ‚á‚ª‚İ’†‚É while crouching
UŒ‚ƒ{ƒ^ƒ“‚ğ“ñ‚ÂˆÈã“¯‰Ÿ‚µ press 2 attack
buttons together when next to
enemy —ì•„‚ğƒ^ƒbƒ` touch reifu

STAGE 5 - [MISSION] CATCH MORE
ITEMS THAN UKITAKE Ukitake moves
at much greater speeds than
normal. Attacks are permitted,
and they cause much more damage
than normal, so the easiest way
to win is to just knock him out
and then grab as many items as
you can before he recovers.

STAGE 9 - [MISSION] SWITCH
PLANES MORE THAN YACHIRU Yachiru
moves much faster than normal,
casts a speed-up reifu on
herself, and runs away from you
when you try to attack her. Try
slowing her down and knocking
her out with Ichigo's special E
(down, up, light attack). Let
her run to the corner, stand a
short distance away, use the
special move, jump to the other
plane, use it again, and keep
repeating. The rocks will slow
her down and periodically knock
her out, which will allow you to
switch planes quickly a few
times without worrying about
her. When she is about to
recover, start using the special
attack to slow her down again. I
recommend using the Prohibit
Line Change reifu on her if
you're still having trouble.

STAGE 10 - [BATTLE] PROTECT
HANATARO FROM 15 GOTEITAISHI
Hanataro will walk around
aimlessly for the most part and
does not attack, and your
attacks cannot hurt him. The
Goteitaishi have relatively low
life bars, and you must defeat
all of them before Hanataro runs
out of health. Make use of
attacks that cover a wide range
or hit in all directions when
many of them are close together,
such as Ichigo's super B and
special B. Sometimes Hanataro
will stand in a corner for an
extended period of time, and
it's usually easiest to guard
him when he's like this. Just
stand right in front of him and
rapidly hit the light attack
button to keep the opponents
away.

STAGE 24 - [MISSION] CATCH 25
ITEMS AS YACHIRU Yachiru trips
when walking or running, so if
you need to cover a lot of
ground quickly, use flash steps.

STAGE 25 - [BATTLE] DEFEAT 3
MAYURI AT THE SAME TIME You must
fight 3 Mayuri at the same time.
They fight without Nemu
accompanying them, and you have
a significantly stronger life
bar. However, each of the CPU
opponents will recover to full
health shortly after being
defeated. In order to win, you
must knock all three opponents
out at the same time. The best
way to do so is to finish them
off with Ichigo's super B.
Yellow Mayuri is 2P, red Mayuri
is 3P, and blue Mayuri is 4P.

STAGE 27 - [MISSION] FULLY HEAL
3 GOTEITAISHI AS HANATARO Three
Goteitaishi start at near death
and must be brought to full
health within the time limit.
They do not attack you, but they
tend to flash step and plane hop
away from you. Use Hanataro's
standing heavy attack to
gradually heal them. Use flash
steps to combo heavy -> flash
step -> heavy -> etc. When
Hanataro's meter at the bottom
of the screen is full, he'll
fire a large burst of energy
from his sword, so make sure
that it doesn't hit any of the
Goteitaishi.

STAGE 29 - [BATTLE] DEFEAT
SOIFON, NEMU, & RANGIKU AS
YACHIRU Your 3 opponents are not
on a team, so you can sit back
and block for a while as they
beat each other up.

STAGE 32 - [MISSION] DODGE ACID
RAIN FOR 40 SECONDS This stuff
breaks through guard, so you'll
have to move around and be
careful not to get hit. Try not
to box yourself into a corner,
and flash step away if it
doesn't look like you can dodge
by walking. Use damage cancels
to break out of stun.

STAGE 37 - [MISSION] BREAK MORE
TARGETS THAN IKKAKU Not too
hard. Knock him out and use
super B to clear multiple
targets at once.

STAGE 38 - [MISSION] HIT
ICHIMARU WITHIN 30 SECONDS AS
RANGIKU All you have to do is
hit Ichimaru before time
expires, but he has super speed
and will try to evade you. Try
using Rangiku's ash clouds to
hit him. Press down, down, guard
to deploy one, and down,
forward, heavy to throw it. If
you still can't hit him, try
setting up a trap. Deploy one
ash cloud, then press down,
down, light to freeze it in
place. Deploy two more ash
clouds next to the existing one,
and use down, forward, heavy to
throw all 3 of them at once.
Throw the ash clouds and then
immediately cross planes if you
need to make Ichimaru switch
planes. Failing that, use a
Prohibit Line Change reifu to
keep him from getting away.

STAGE 42 - [MISSION] BE THE
FIRST TO ANSWER 5 QUESTIONS
CORRECTLY The floor is split
into two halves marked with an O
and X on each half. Mayuri will
quiz you on a number of things
related to Bleach and you must
answer either true (O) or false
(X) for each question by
standing on the appropriate half
of the stage when time runs out.
You must answer 5 questions
correctly before Ikkaku, who
will be trying to fight you at
the same time. I don't have the
answers for each question as of
this time, so the best advice I
can give is to just stay on the
same side as Ikkaku for each
question once you have 1 more
point than him. You can also try
knocking him off of the side
that he tries to stay on in
order to prevent him from
getting a point, but he doesn't
always answer the questions
correctly to begin with.

you've cleared ending 1 (stage
93). You cannot access stage 98
until you've cleared ending 2
(stage 97). Stage 98 will take

„  UNLOCKS AND REWARDS „ 
„¤---------------------„£
The following is a list of
notable one-time rewards in
Story Mode. As stated earlier,
the easiest way to unlock every
character is to shoot for 100%
completion in Easy mode. Play
every stage in parts A and B on
Easy during your first
playthrough, and then play as
many as you can in part C before
accessing ending 1. Skip
straight to part C on your next
playthrough and play the stages
you missed before accessing
ending 2. You'll have to play 3
times in order to access part D.

After you unlock a character,
you can purchase their system
voice set from the shop. Some
nonplayable characters also have
system voice sets.

bonus 20000 points for clearing
either mode for the first time
with each character. You can get
the bonus for each character
twice; once in solo battle and
once in team battle. Time Attack
Mode is only available after
clearing Story Mode.

TRAINING MODE allows you to
practice against a CPU dummy
with full power gauges. Use it
to check and practice commands
for each character. You can set
the CPU dummy to perform certain
actions or fight you normally
via the pause menu.

SURVIVAL MODE pits you against
every character in the game at
random in an endless sequence of
fights. You regain only a little
bit of life between matches.
This mode has the greatest
potential for earning money for
the shop once you've cleared
Story Mode; longer winning
streaks can net you
exponentially greater sums. You
must clear Story Mode in order
to unlock Survival Mode.

„  SECTION VIII: DECK
CONSTRUCTION (ƒfƒbƒLƒRƒ“ƒXƒgƒ‰ƒNƒVƒ‡ƒ“) „ 
„¤-------------------------------
This mode is where you arrange
your 5 custom reifu decks for
use during battle. Select a slot
on the main screen to check its
current arrangement.

ƒJƒXƒ^ƒ}ƒCƒY  CUSTOMIZE
ƒRƒs[        COPY
“ü‚ê‘Ö‚¦      SWAP
–¼Ì•ÏX      RENAME
ƒLƒƒƒ“ƒZƒ‹    CANCEL

Select CUTSOMIZE to change the
deck's arrangement. Select COPY
to duplicate one of your
existing decks. Select SWAP to
change the order of the deck
list. Select RENAME to change
the deck's title. Select CANCEL
to go back.

After selecting Customize from
the menu, two rows of cards will
appear on the touch screen. The
top row are the cards currently
present in this deck. The bottom
row are all of the cards you
have in reserves. You can buy
more at the Urahara Shop. The
menu at the bottom from left to
right is: Reserve Selection,
Reifu, Reiju, and Frame.
Changing the Reserve Selection
narrows the reserves list down
to one category of cards at a
time for faster navigation.
Selecting Frame allows you to
choose the base frame for this
deck. Different frames allow you
to utilize different amounts of
each category of reifu as well
as different amounts of reiju.
You can unlock additional frames
in Story Mode and then proceed
to purchase them from the shop.

To add a reifu to your deck,
simply find it in the reserves
list and press A to move it to
the slot list. To remove a reifu
from your deck, find it in the
slot list and press A to move it
back to the reserves. The top
screen shows the current
configuration of your deck. In
order to be able to save your
changes, you must make sure that
none of the status counters at
the top of the screen are
blinking red. There are three
counters at the top-right corner
of the screen: card count, power
count, and reiju count. When you
add a card to your deck, the
card count increases by one and
the power count increases by the
number at the bottom-left corner
of the card (deck cost). More
powerful cards generally have
higher deck costs.

Select the reiju option on the
touch screen to view the current
reiju configuration for your
deck. The default deck frame has
3 reiju holders, which doesn't
accommodate for much. Different
frames allow you to configure
reiju in a 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4
grid. Select a reiju from your
reserves at the bottom and then
fit them into the frame with the
A button. Press X if you need to
rotate the gems in order to make
them fit.

When you are done customizing
your deck, press the B button to
go back to the main menu. If
you're presented with a YES/NO
prompt, it means that you have
not created a valid deck and
pressing YES to exit will cause
changes to be lost.

„  SECTION IX: URAHARA SHOP
(‰YŒ´¤“X) & GALLERY (ƒMƒƒƒ‰ƒŠ[) „ 
„¤-------------------------------

„¡--------------„¢
„  URAHARA SHOP „ 
„¤--------------„£
The shop contains a number of
things for you to purchase
through points earned during the
regular game. The fastest ways
to earn money are to fully
complete Story Mode on all
difficulties, enter specific
touch screen passwords, and
getting high scores in Survival
Mode.

Everything in the ITEM menu is
related to the reifu/reiju deck
system used in battle. You may
have to unlock some of them in
Story Mode before you can buy
them from the shop. The COLOR
menu has 4 alternate outfits for
each character. The GRAPHIC and
SOUND menus contain pictures and
audio that can be accessed in
the Gallery. The VOICE menu
contains all of the voice
samples for each character; you
can listen to them in the
Gallery or change your System
Voice setting so that different
characters read the menus.

Three specific touch screen
passwords can be entered to earn
more money (300000 each). They
are pictures of Kon's paw print,
a jar, and Chappy. Cutouts of
each of these pictures can
supposedly be found in Jump, and
they are supposed to be placed
over the touch screen for you to
trace them. It's actually not
too hard to trick the game into
accepting random scribbles
instead, though. Just draw a
bunch of circles and random
lines and you might be able to
get all of them.

„  GALLERY „

Most of the items in the gallery
must first be purchased from

Event and character graphics are

If you skip cutscenes, however,
you may fail to unlock all of
them. The Shinigami Manual
contains information about the
characters and the world of
Bleach.

„  SECTION X: GET YOUR GAME ON -
BLEACH DS IRC CHANNEL „ 
„¤-------------------------------
If you're looking for people to
play with on Wi-Fi, there's a
quasi-official IRC channel set
up for just that. Discussion can
veer wildly off-topic at times,
but it's more convenient to
arrange matches here than it is
on message boards, and it's
usually the best place on the
net to find somebody to fight.
The server is irc.rizon.net and
the channel is #Bleach_ds. If
you are unfamiliar with IRC, use
one of the following guides to
join the chat. Once you're in
the channel just ask if anybody
wants to play.

„¡------------„¢
„  USING MIRC „ 
„¤------------„£
mIRC is a popular IRC client for
Windows. You can download it at
the following URL:
http://www.mirc.com/get.html.
Though the splash screen says
that the program is a 30-day
evaluation version, you can
still use it after the 30 days
expire. Just wait a few seconds
on the splash screen until the
Continue button becomes active.

After installing and starting
mIRC:
1) The Options screen should
   appear. Enter a username into
   the Nickname box and
an alternate name to the
Alternate box. I recommend
listing your friend code in your
nickname as well (example:
"YourName|123456789012"). Enter
a fake name and fake e-mail
address to their corresponding
boxes. (You can use your real
name and e-mail if you like, but
there's no reason to do so.)
2) Click "Servers" in the
   category list on the left.
   Scroll down to Rizon in
the list and hit the Select
button on the right. This will
bring you back to the Connect
screen. Click the "Connect to
server" button and you should
log-in to the Rizon server with
your nickname.
3) The channels window will pop-
   up once you are logged in.
   Type "#Bleach_ds"
(without the quotes) and click
the Join button at the top of
the screen to enter the Bleach
DS channel.

„¡----------------„¢
„  USING TRILLIAN „ 
„¤----------------„£
Trillian is an instant messaging
/ chat program that is
compatible with several IM
protocols (AIM, MSN, etc). It's
useful if you just want to use
one program to take care of all
of your IM/chat needs. The
following guide was written by
Jayce. Skip to step 9 if you
already have Trillian installed.

1) Download Trillian here: http:

    choose "Identities and
    Connections."
11) Click add a new connection
    and choose IRC.
12) Check the box on the bottom
    (Automatically connect to
    this account on startup) and
    fill in the bla following:
  [ Rizon Bleach Chan           
  [ irc.rizon.net               
[ Your screen name             ]
[ Your "real" name             ]
[ Any misc profile information ]
13) Click "Change..."
14) In the preform buffer box
    check the "After successful
    connection to irc ...
    preform following comman
15) In the text box under the
    preform buffer add "/join
    #Bleach_ds".
16) Click the misc tab and check
    the "rejoin channel when
    kicked" option.
17) Click save settings then
    click connect. You should
    join the BDS IRC chan every
    time you start Trillia

„  USING TINYIRC „ 
„¤---------------„£
The following was provided by
Gen2000. TinyIRC is useful in
that it does not require
installation and can be run from
a thumb drive or other removable
media.

1) Get the program from
   http://www.tinyirc.net.
2) Click on "Quick Connect".
3) In the Server Info category,
   change Server to
   irc.rizon.net. Leave the port
   number as is and don't worry
4) In the User Info category,
   change the Nickname to
   whatever nick you want to go
   by when in the #Bleach_ds
   nicks in case those nicks are
5) Click "Connect". When
   successfully connected to the
   server, type "/join
   #Bleach_ds" to enter the chan

It's a pretty basic irc program
but it gets the job done and
there are a few settings you can
mess around to change font or
background colors as well as
font sizes if you want it to
mirror the actual mirc program
font style and sizes.

„¡----------------„¢
„  USING JAVA IRC „ 
„¤----------------„£
Also provided by Gen2000. You
can run this version of IRC
directly from your browser.

1) Enter this URL into your
   address bar:

This java applet for chatting is
pretty barebones, you can't even
resize the window but for those
don't want to download anything
(although I would recommend just
running TinyIRC from the zip
file off their website instead)
and still want to chat then you
try this method.
