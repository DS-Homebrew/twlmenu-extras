The original portable Final
Fantasy Tactics Advance was an
excellent game. Sure, some may
say that the game lacked depth
and a solid storyline, but where
FFTA truly shined was in its
capacity for customization.
There's no rigidity. Players
could mold and shape their own
clan to their heart's content
through its seamless job system.
This is a feature I felt was a
nice breath of fresh air from
the primarily inflexible systems
of other RPGs.

For that reason, I was not all
disappointed with Final Fantasy
Tactics A2. The same
personalization of the original
FFTA was retained, with a whole
bunch of new jobs, abilities,
and other features thrown in.
Many of the more irritating
characteristics of FFTA were
changed for the better. For
example, laws still exist, but
there's no longer any
imprisonment - rather, penalties
are instilled on your party
instead. Players of the original
game should be able to
transition from FFTA to FFTA2
quite easily because many of the
original gameplay mechanics are
still intact.

This guide is designed to walk
players through the game.
Included is a listing of all 400
available missions, full
appendices, and other sections
relating to various aspects of
the game (although obviously not
complete yet). I hope you find
it helpful!

+-------------------------------

  [Q] How are dispatch missions
  different in FFTA2?

  [A] In the original FFTA,
  dispatch missions were
  finished by simply
   selecting a character to send
   off and going through the set
   time, etc. In FFTA2, you have
   ability, but you can also
   choose to complete the
   dispatch mission yourself.

+-------------------------------

  [Q] How do I unlock the
  Shadeholme area in Graszton?

  [A] You must complete Mission
  E1-02: Bonga Bugle - Silversun
  in order
     to unlock this region.

+-------------------------------

  [Q] When can I start resting
  in Lezaford's Hut?

  [A] After you complete the Now
  That's a Fire! mission. You
  can rest
   for 20, 60, or 200 days in
   his dwelling.

+-------------------------------

  [Q] What is MVP status?

  [A] A unit can attain MVP
  status by dealing the most
  damage in
   battles (among other ways,
   which would lead to that
   particular units being the
   'most valuable player', so to
   speak).

   A unit with MVP status will
   have a higher chance of
   successfully
 completing dispatch missions.

+-------------------------------

  [Q] What are Opportunity
  abilities?

  [A] Opportunity abilities are
  random opportunities (for lack
  of better
   term) given to one of your
   units in battle. They are
   random, but you can increase
   the chance of getting one
   through Clan Privileges that
   raise luck. When one of your
   units feels empowered (again,
   for lack of better term),
   he/she will deliver a
   statement (usually relates to
   how POWERFUL he/she feels all
   of a sudden).

   After an Opportunity Turn has
   become available, you can
   freely move the affected unit
   to manipulate some of the
   commands. These abilities are
   determined by what units your
   affected unit is adjacent
   too. The abilities are as
   follows:

   - No one: Tough as Nails!
     (Casts Barrier on the user.
     Grants SHELL
   and PROTECT.)
   - No one, last unit
     remaining, Tough as Nails!
     (Casts RERAISE on
   the user.)
   - 1 Ally: Battle Shout! (Cast
     Force on the user and
     surrounding
  allies. raises RESILIENCE.)
   - 2 Allies: Fleet of Foot!
     (Casts Hastega on the user
     and two
   adjacent allies.)
   - 3 Allies: Shield of Steel!
     (Cast Astra on the user and
     three
   adjacent units to protect
   them from debuffs.)
   - 1 Enemy: Flurry! (Pummel an
     adjacent unit with two
     consecutive
   blows.)
   - 2 Enemies: Eye for an eye!
     (Let fly with a flurry of
     attacks!
Damages two surrounding units.)

+-------------------------------

  [Q] What is the punishment for
  breaking the law?

  [A] 1. Judge leaves, meaning
  that dead units cannot be
  revived until
   battle is over.
  2. Clan Privilege annulled.
   3. Reward at end of battle is
      removed.
   4. BAWWW!

   Honestly though, the
   punishment for breaking the
   law is nothing too
   devastating. You may find
   that it's easier sometimes to
   just ignore the law.

+-------------------------------

  [Q] How do I unlock Brightmoon
  Tor?

  [A] First, you must complete
  A2-02: The Sun Seal to unlock
  the area in
   Graszton where the tower
   spawns. You also have to read
   the notice at the pub
   entitled "The Mysterious
   Tower."

   Though you can unlock the
   tower fairly early in the
   game, it's not recommended
   that you attempt it until
   much later unless you
  are some sort of masochist.

+-------------------------------

  [Q] Are there law cards in
  this game?

  [A] Unfortunately, no. You're
  forced to abide by the law or
  face the
   punishment.

+-------------------------------

  [Q] What are some of the new
  features of Final Fantasy
  Tactics A2?

  [A] Among the Seeqs and Grias,
  the two new races, a Bazaar
  feature has
   been added. The Bazaar is
   essentially a center where
   you can trade loot acquired
   from battles to add new
   equipment to the shops for
   purchase. More information on
   this can be found in the
   Bazaar's respective section.

   Also, the Auction House has
   been added. Early on, you can
   auction for territories. Once
   you've managed to acquire all
   territories, you'll be
   allowed to auction for items.
   Most of these items are quite
   rare, and the auction system
   allows you to attain them
   earlier than you normally
   would. More information on
   this can be found in the
   Auction House's respective
   section.

+-------------------------------

  [Q] I gained control of all
  regions in the Auction House,
  but I still
   can't bid for items. What's
   going on?

  [A] In order to become
  Champion for Life, you must
  EXPLORE all regions
   under an Auction House.
   Perhaps there is an area you
   still have not walked through
   yet? Make sure that you've
   fully explored all the
   outlying areas in each
   region.

+-------------------------------

  [Q] How does the new MP system
  work?

  [A] Instead of starting off
  each battle with a set amount
  of MP, all
   units now begin battles with
   0 MP. The MP gauge gradually
   increases each turn by 10 MP.
   Therefore, spellcasters and
   MP-users cannot present an
   immediate threat at the
   beginning of battles. There
   are ways to get around this
   restriction though. The
   methods include, but are not
   limited to, specific
   abilities that can regenerate
   MP and the MP Boost ability,
   which regenerates 20
MP per turn as opposed to 10 MP.

|_|=============================

Many of the basic aspects of
Final Fantasy Tactics A2 are
explained in the game, along
with the manual of course. The
following sections are a brief
overview of the characteristics
of the game, including the
battle system and laws.

()------------------------------
||                            3.
()------------------------------

If you are familiar with the
battle system of FFT or FFTA (or
even other strategy RPGs), the
system of Final Fantasy Tactics
A2 should not be difficult to
pick up.

              ---

Battles typically begin with you
having to select units to place
on the battlefield. The area
where you begin is designated by
green tiles. In most cases, the
number of units you can place on
the field cannot exceed six.

Turns are determined by the
SPEED stat - units with higher
SPEED are granted earlier turns.
Note that speed-altering status
changes such as Haste, Slow, and
Stop have an effect on turn
order.

When a unit's turn comes up,
three options become available.
You can choose to:

   Move: This allows a character
   to move to a different
   location. Blue tiles
 represent locations where the
 selected unit can move to. The
 distance that a unit can move
 is determined by the MOVE stat.
 For example, a unit with a MOVE
 stat of 4 can move a total of
 four steps. The height that a
 unit can jump is determined by
 the JUMP stat. For example, a
 unit with a JUMP stat of 4 can
 jump up to another location
 four height units above or jump
 down to another location four
 height units below.

   Action: This option allows
   the selected character to
   execute an action. An
 action can be simply attacking
 an enemy with a physical attack
 through the Attack command,
 using a special ability, or
 using an item through the Item
 command.

   Wait: Select this option to
   command the selected unit to
   stand without
 doing anything. Wait can be
 selected after moving or before
 moving. Units who wait will
 have an earlier turn the next
 round.

After a unit has finished
his/her turn, you will be
required to select a facing,
which is essentially which
direction you want the selected
unit to be looking to. Facing is
important to battle because it
determines damage. Attacks to
the front will deal the least
damage. Attacks to the side will
deal more damage than attacks to
the front. Finally, attacks to
the back will deal the most
damage.

Battles will progress, with each
unit taking his/her turn until
the fight is finished.

And that's the general gist of
it. It's not at all tough to
pick up.

()------------------------------
|| 3.2. Ability Mastery [3200]
||
()------------------------------

An integral part of this game is
the job system. There are a over
40 jobs spread over the six
available races in Final Fantasy
Tactics A2. Each unique job has
its own set of abilities that
can be mastered through wearing
equipment. This is exactly the
same system used in the original
FFTA, so anyone familiar with
that game shouldn't need an
explanation.

              ---

How does this system work?
Ability mastery relies on AP
(ability points). Many pieces of
equipment come associated with
particular abilities for
different classes. These
abilities will be listed with
the equipment when you view
them. Only the job attached to
the ability is capable of
learning that skill. For
example, a Soldier obviously
cannot learn the Black Mage
ability, Fira.

Alongside each ability is an AP
requirement. In order to master
a particular ability (this means
that you can use the ability
without having to wear the
respective piece of equipment),
you must fulfill this AP
requirement. All units will gain
AP points from completing
battles regardless of whether or
not they actually participated
in the battle. Units who did not
participate will gain AP, but
not EXP, mind.

There are three specific types
of abilities:

   - Action Ability: These are
     skills that you order a
     unit to carry out. They
 will appear as commands on the
 battle menu. The majority of
 skills are considered Action
 Abilities or A-Abilities. A
 unit can hold a total of two
 sets of Action Abilities
 (therefore, a unit can use the
 A-Abilities of up to two jobs).
   - Reaction Ability: These are
     skills that are reactive
     (hence the name).
 They require an impetus of some
 sort to activate. For example,
 Counter is a common Reaction
 Ability (R-Ability). It is
 executed when a unit with the
 ability is hit by another unit
 at melee range. The attacked
 unit will counterattack with a
 physical attack of their own.
 The commanding player has no
 control over his units'
 R-Abilities. The player can't
 order a unit to execute a
 R-Ability. A unit can only have
 one R-Ability at a time.
   - Support (Passive) Ability:
     These are skills that are
     activated at all
 times. They are often buffs or
 skills that add to specific
 resistances. A unit can only
 have one S-Ability at a time.

()------------------------------
||                           3.3
()------------------------------

Laws dictate the forbidden
action of a particular battle.
Unlike the system of FFTA
though, laws are unchanging and
are determined solely by what
battle you are fighting in.

Typically, when you enter
battle, the law will be
presented at the beginning of
the fight. The category is
usually limited to things such
as Fire, where any fire-based
ability or weapon is forbidden,
and Ranged Weapons, where any
ranged weapon is forbidden.
Sometimes, the laws can get
pretty outrageous. There are
actually laws that forbids
Missing, as in missing a target,
and Being Robbed.

Although laws are considerably
tougher to follow at certain
points in the game, punishments
are not that severe (at least in
comparison to the whole jail
thing of FFTA). Upon breaking a
law, the Judge leaves the
battlefield, meaning that any
fallen party members cannot be
revived until the end of the
battle. Also, any activated Clan
Privileges will be annulled and
the reward for abiding by the
law will be removed at the end.

In certain missions, however,
abiding by the law is mandatory,
meaning that if you break the
law, the mission is
automatically forfeited. Clan
Trials are among some of the
missions that require you to
abide by the law.

[-------------------------------

Ah, it's summer vacation at
last! At the very start, you'll
be asked to write down your
name. Feel free to name him
anything. For the record, I'll
call the main character Luso
(that's his default name).
Afterwards, you will be asked to
fill out a few quick questions
as part of his summer journal
assignment:

 1. This summer I'm going to...
  a) Hang out with my friends!
 b) Play video games non-stop!
    c) Study for next year!

 2. As a personal goal, I want
    to...
a) Be able to swim half a mile!
 b) Get my warrior to level 75!
  c) Learn a foreign language!

3. Next year I promise not to...
     a) Misbehave in class.
  b) Oversleep in the morning.
 c) Let my dog eat my homework.

  Power Up 2:  b, b, b
  Evade Up 2:  b, a, a
  Speed Up 2:  b, c, a
  Luck 2:      b, a, b
  Bonus EXP 1: b, c, b
  Bonus AP 1:  b, c, c
  Bonus Gil 1: b, a, c
  Bonus CP 1:  b, b, c
  Smash Up 1:  b, b, a

Depending on your selections,
you'll be given a Clan Privilege
bonus at the very beginning.
What does that mean? Clan
Privileges are essentially buffs
and bonuses that you can
activate at the beginning of
battles. Only one can be
activated per battle. These will
come into play later in the
game. For now, make your
selections (I'd recommend Bonus
AP 1 because it will help you
master abilities more quickly
early) to carry on.

Because Luso Clemens has some
behavior problems, he's forced
to go to the library after
school to do some chores. Wow,
what a crummy way to start off
the summer, huh?

Down at the library, Mr. Randell
appears to be nowhere in sight
(for those who have played FFTA,
you might recognize the teddy
bear on the counter). Watch the
rest of the cutscene as it plays
out, as poor Luso is transported
to a mysterious world through
the book, the Gran Grimoire.


       T A R G   W O O D
       O---------------O
     Birdsong fills this
     peaceful forest.
   A small village stands among
   the watchful trees.


The scene shifts to a forest,
where Luso makes his rather
unexpected appearance in front
of Cid and his clan. After a bit
of persuasion from him, Luso
agrees to join the clan that he
meets. Not soon thereafter,
you'll be thrust into your first
battle. Hope you are ready for
it!

   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=
   - STRANGER IN THE WOODS -
   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=

   "We hunters of the village
   tried to stop 'im, to no
   avail. Somebody do
    somethin', please! You don't
    need to kill 'im, just
    drivin' 'im off will do."
~ Heriward, Wood Village Hunter

   Objective:
 - Defeat Klesta!

   Forbidden:
 - Ranged Weapons: Attacks with
   bows, greatbows, guns, hand-
   cannons, and
  cards are forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Cockatrice x2
 - Klesta (Crushatrice) x1
   [target]

   This first battle serves as a
   tutorial for those who are
   unfamiliar with the mechanics
   of battle. If you've played
   FFTA before, then you should
   already be familiar with the
   general battle system.
   However, if you have
   absolutely no idea how to
   play, then I'd strongly
   suggest reading the
   instructions carefully. It's
   really not hard to pick up
   once you understand it.

   You have control over Luso,
   the Viera White Mage and the
   Nu Mou Black Mage. The other
   dude, Cid, will act on his
   own accord. As part of the
   tutorial, you'll be forced to
   hit Klesta (which is a
   Crushatrice) with a Fire
   spell.

   To finish the battle, all you
   have to do is defeat Klesta.
   Since Luso is a new Soldier,
   he won't have any Art of War
   techniques available right
   now. Rather, you will have to
   rely on physical attacks at
   the moment. Before going
   straight for Klesta, you can
   target the two Cockatrice
   monsters, and get rid of them
   first.

   Once they are out of the way,
   you can focus your efforts on
   the big bird himself, Klesta.
   He is fairly powerful, so be
   prepared to heal using your
   White Mage (Cure). Watch out
   for his Territorial Marking
   and Peck attacks; both are
   moves that deals damage over
   an area. Do not group your
   units together to avoid
   taking unnecessary damage.
   You only need to bring Klesta
   down to about a quarter HP
   before it flies off.

Congratulations, you've
successfully completed your
first battle. Granted, there are
more difficult fights to come,
but it's a good start.

Afterwards, you'll be given a
brief introduction to the
workings of the world map. With
that, you will be requested to
approach the area with the blue
balloon over it. However, you
should save your game first. Do
this by opening up the system
menu and selecting the save
option. When you're ready, head
into the Wood Village.


    W O O D   V I L L A G E
    O---------------------O
   A small village where time
   seems to stand still.
    The fresh mushroom stew is
    not to be missed.


In the local pub, you'll be
introduced to your new clan...
which doesn't quite have a name
yet. Of course, that's all up to
you. However, I do not suggest
naming it Clan Gully. That's
almost as bad as Clan Nutsy back
in the original FFTA.

There is really not much to do
out here, so go to the pub in
Wood Village. Cid will introduce
you to the concept of quests,
which can be found listed at any
pub. Select the quest roster and
check the list of quests. You
should also get used to checking
the rumors as well, for they can
unlock new quests later on.
Right now, I'd suggest reading
the rumors if you're fairly new
to the game, for they hold
important gameplay information.

The only quest available is A
Paw Full of Feathers. Accept it
(at a fee of 100 gil), and a
blue bubble will appear over the
Muskmallow Field. Cid suggests
checking out the local shop
first before you leave. The
selection is pretty bad, so I
wouldn't recommend purchasing
anything at this point.

While leaving the shop, the
shopkeeper suggests that you
check out the bazaar, a new
feature that allows you to put
up loot and get items in return.
Loot is essentially the
leftovers picked up from fights.
This loot can subsequently be
traded at the bazaar for varying
items. The items you get in
return depend on how valuable
the loot is. Better loot leads
to more powerful equipment and
rare items. All unlocked items
become available at the shop
afterwards.

Give it a try! Select the
Apprentice Weapons option and
pick out Gikhet Lead and Faren
Pollen from your loot inventory.
Both of these pieces of loot are
rated E, meaning, in terms of
value, they're at the very
bottom. Still, you can attain
the ability to purchase
Broadswords as a trade. A
Broadsword gives a nice attack
boost to Luso (and teaches the
Soldier skill, First Aid), so
pick it up.

When you're ready to continue,
make your way to Muskmallow
Field for the next mission.

   "What's in the woods? Wolves,
   that's what! And my chocobos
   are so put out,
    they're molting early.
    Somebody, rid us of these
    horrible howlers!"
   ~ Chocobo Corral "Sasasha"

   Objective:
 - Defeat all foes!

   Forbidden:
 - Fire: Weapons and abilities
   that use fire are forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Wolf x2
 - Baknamy x1

   Oh no, wolves! If you are
   unfamiliar with laws, listen
   to Cid's explanation before
   the battle begins. This time
   around, fire is banned,
   meaning you can't use any
   fire-based ability in battle.
   Otherwise, you'll suffer a
   stiff penalty. You will also
   be introduced to clan
   abilities, which can be
   selected before each battle
   begins.

   Select four extra units to
   bring into battle. This fight
   is not too difficult, so
   there's no extensive strategy
   involved. After selecting
   units, pick a clan privilege.
   For this fight, I'd suggest
   Power Up 1. When you are
   ready to go, start the
   battle.

   There are three targets you
   have to kill. The two Wolves
   are weak, so focus on them
   first. At the moment, you
   probably do not have two many
   abilities available. For now,
   just whack the monsters with
   your strongest units. If you
   brought a Black Mage, use his
   Black Magick. Obviously, you
   can't cast Fire because the
   law forbids it.

   The Baknamy can use Goblin
   Attack, a special ability
   that inflicts damage while
   ignoring defense. The Wolves
   can use Fang, which deals
   moderate damage. If any of
   your units run low on HP, be
   sure to have a White Mage to
   heal them. Eliminate all
   three targets to finish the
   mission.

After the battle, Luso will
discover his journal, which
appears to be magickal! When you
return to the world map, head
back to the pub in Wood Village.
Back there, you'll overhear a
conversation about bandits on
the roads. Cid will leave you
for a bit, so you're on your own
right now. Check the pubs for
some more missions. This time
around, there's a bit more
variety. Feel free to take on
some of the side missions before
selecting the next storyline
mission, The Yellow Wings.

   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~
   - THE YELLOW WINGS -
   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~

   "Drive off those brigands,
   the Yellow Wings, before I
   lose what little
    business I got left! They've
    been squatting the highroad,
    demanding gil from all what
    pass by.

    If I can't use that
    highroad, I can't get to
    Camoa; and if I can't get to
    Camoa, I'm finished!"
       ~ Kagran, Merchant

   Objective:
 - Defeat all foes!

   Forbidden:
 - Ice: Weapons and abilities
   that use ice are forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Thief x1
 - White Monk x1
 - Archer x1
 - Animist x1
 - Black Mage x1

   Your party will quickly run
   into the Yellow Wings.
   They're just asking for
   trouble. Bring in four extra
   units for the ensuing battle.
   I'd suggest sending in a
   White Mage to heal. The rest
   of the party is up to you.
   Note that the law forbids
   anything ice-based, so manage
   your party accordingly. At
   this point in the game
   though, I doubt you have any
   ice-based weapons that could
   potentially trigger it. Just
   avoid ice-based abilities.

   The enemy party likely has
   the speed advantage over your
   team. Let them move first.
   It's improbable that any of
   them will be able to strike
   you on the first turn, so
   don't worry about that. The
   Animist will usually begin
   the fight with 100% Wool,
   which puts Protect and Shell
   on the caster. For that
   reason, you'll want to deal
   with him last because the
   Protect and Shell wear off
   over time.

   The Archer can cast Focus on
   herself, which increases the
   damage on her next attack.
   The remaining units don't
   have any skills to really
   worry about. The Black Mage
   is capable of casting the
   three basic elemental spells
   though, so do not keep your
   units grouped together.

   It is best to take out the
   Black Mage and White Monk
   first because they can deal
   the most amount of damage.
   The White Monk will approach
   your party, so meet him as he
   approaches. By concentrating
   your attacks, the two should
   fall quickly. Next, go for
   the Thief. Lastly, eliminate
   the Archer and Animist. When
   all enemy units have been
   knocked out, the mission will
   end.

Finishing the mission will
unlock the region of Camoa. You
can choose to continue if you
want, though there are more
missions in the local pub that
you may want to check out. Clan
Trials are unlocked as well.
These entries allow you to
compete for better Clan
Privileges and other rewards.
I'd suggest trying the ones
available to you for some nice
bonuses.

The Camoa Highroad leads to the
Camoa region.


           C A M O A
           O-------O
   Camoa is a famed gathering
   spot for adventurers. The
   countryside surrounding the
   city is a verdant
     patchwork of crops and
     pastureland.


Upon entering the Camoa region,
make your way to the city of
Camoa. It will be clearly marked
for you with a blue bubble.
Camoa, I guess you can say, is
more of a full-fledged town in
comparison to Wood Village.
Watch the scene that follows,
and you will meet Ribs, who
wants a tomato stalk. This will
unlock the next story mission,
You Say Tomato, along with a
number of other missions.

After accepting You Say Tomato,
head over to the Adventurer's
Rest in the Camoa region.

   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~
   - YOU SAY TOMATO -
   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~

   "You say tomato, I say kill
   them all!

    Why kill vegetables, you
    ask? Har!

    Did I mention quivering
    stalks, or slavering fangs?
    I was out for a stroll the
    other day and one bit clean
    through me britches! I doubt
    me or me britches are the
    only victims here. Help!"

      ~ Gusah, Greengrocer

   Objective:
 - Defeat all foes!

   Forbidden:
 - Lightning: Weapons and
   abilities that use lightning
   are forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Deadly Nightshade x4
 - Alraune x1

   In case you weren't already
   aware, tomatoes (Deadly
   Nightshades) are quite
   vicious. While surveying the
   area, a new face shows up.
   Cid agrees to let her join
   for a fraction of the reward.
   Much like Cid, Adelle is a
   guest who you cannot control.
   However, she will prove to be
   an asset nonetheless. Bring
   in five units of your own in
   addition to the two others.
   This fight is ridiculously
   easy, so don't worry too much
   about who to bring in.

   You should focus on the
   Deadly Nightshades first.
   They are speedy little
   creatures, so keep your guard
   up to prevent them from
   swarming you. These Deadly
   Nightshades can use Tomato
   Tackle, an attack that lowers
   speed, and Tomato Fang, which
   knocks back. Two of them can
   use the Green Magick spells,
   Blind and Raise, and the
   other two have some sort of
   Passive Ability that raises
   attack or defense. Though
   irritating, their low HP
   makes them easy to take down
   with a few strikes.

   The Alraune, however, is a
   bit more formidable. Its
   Impale techniques include
   Horn Blow, which deals
   moderate damage and knocks
   back, Horn Venom, which
   inflicts poison status, and
   Horn Shot, which is a fairly
   weak attack with an increased
   chance of hitting. Its
   defense stats are slightly
   higher than the Deadly
   Nightshades, but it should
   not pose a problem.

   Be sure to grab the chest at
   the lower-right corner of the
   battlefield before finishing
   off the last monster.

After the fight, Adelle will
disappear with the alraune drill
in her pocket. Watch the
humorous scene that follows.
When you return to the world
map, a blue bubble will appear
Camoa, which probably means you
should head on over.

Back in town, Ribs will give you
a bit of information regarding
the history of Ivalice and the
great Lezaford. Meanwhile, a
rather nonchalant Adelle just so
happens to walk by. With that, a
new area becomes available:
Baptiste Hill.


   B A P T I S T E   H I L L
   O-----------------------O
   Green grasses cover the
   gently sloping hillside.
  A refreshing wind eases the
  burdens of passing travelers.


There are no towns in Baptiste
Hill, so you will have to rely
on the Camoa or Wood Village
pub. Speaking of which, there
are plenty of new missions. Give
a few of them a try before
proceeding to activate the next
storyline mission, Wanted:
Ugohr. If the mission isn't
showing up, note that you must
have completed Wanted: The
Cyanwolf in order to make it
appear.

    made by injured party."

~ Jylland Defenders of the Peace

   Objective:
 - Defeat Ugohr!

   Forbidden:
 - Restoring MP: Actions that
   restore MP are forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Wolf x2
 - Cockatrice x2
 - Ugohr (Great Tortoise) x1

   Your objective here is the
   big green thing, Ugohr. Bring
   in six units and deploy them.
   The monsters in this battle
   are fairly weak, with the
   exception of the mark, of
   course. You can choose to
   ignore the other monsters and
   go straight for Ugohr if
   you're in a rush. Just bear
   in mind that Ugohr is the
   mission's objective.

   The Cockatrices can use Peck,
   which deals moderate damage.
   Otherwise, they are not very
   dangerous at all, and they
   will only serve to get in the
   way. They also have Critical:
   Quicken as their R-Ability,
   which automatically gifts the
   Cockatrice the very next turn
   should it enter critical HP
   status. The Wolves can use
   Fang and nothing else. Like
   the Cockatrices, they too are
   not very threatening. Both
   the Cockatrices and Wolves
   are weak to water-based
   attacks, so use those (if
   applicable) to dispatch them
   quickly.

   Ugohr has got quite a few
   abilities at its disposal.
   Luckily for you, it's very
   slow, so if you are quick,
   you should be able to
   eliminate it before it can
   pose too much of a problem.
   Ugohr can use Rain of Stone,
   which deals earth damage to
   an area, and Sonic Spin,
   which damages surrounding
   units. Watch out especially
   for his Headbutt ability for
   it can inflict Immobilize
   status on its target. Ugohr's
   defense is quite high, and
   it's further augmented by his
   Defense Up P-Ability, so it
   may take a few turns before
   it falls.

Following the battle, a familiar
face shows up again to scavenge
for some treasure. She happens
to fall right into Cid's
cleverly laid trap.
Unfortunately, she's already
sold off the stolen horn and
spent all the gil.

Back on the world map, head over
to Camoa. Here, the team will
meet Adelle yet again. It seems
like that rat trap hadn't
stopped her. Luso reluctantly
decides to let her join.
Unfortunately, you have no say
in it. It's not a bad thing
since Adelle is a pretty good
Thief. Plus, she comes equipped
with a Khukuri!

Afterwards, the Bisga Highroad
should become available. Finish
whatever business you have in
Camoa and proceed over there.

   Thick vegetation grows across
   this broad plain.
  Many travelers pass along its
  extensive network of roads.


From the Bisga Greenlands, you
can travel further to the
southwest to reach Graszton
along the Graszton Highroad.


        G R A S Z T O N
        O-------------O
  This narrow stretch of land
  overlooks the Sea of Ewohl.
 People and goods stream through
 the busy port city of Graszton.


Graszton is the biggest city
you've encountered thus far.
It's a port, so you can expect
plenty of business. Once you've
entered the region, head to the
city of Graszton (as if the blue
bubble didn't make it obvious
enough).

A bit of shady business will be
carried out, and a Ninja will
shoot a gun at Cid. He survives,
though he won't be in your party
for a little while. He will
divulge the location of Lezaford
for you - he is in the Aldanna
Range.

The Aldanna Range can be
accessed through a highroad in
the Baptiste Hill region. It's
the northwestern path out.

   Rugged highland with row upon
   row of soaring peaks.
  Hardy mountain shrubs grow

Deep.

  Countless tunnels make up this
  vast underground cavern. It's

The path loops back around to
the Bisga Greenlands. And this
ends our tour of the new
unlocked areas. Now, you can
head back to any pub and do some
more missions. The next story
mission in line is Wanted:
Gilmunto.

   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~
   - WANTED: GILMUNTO -
   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~

   "- WANTED! -
    Wanted: Gilmunto, possibly a
    variant strain of nidhogg,
    known to lurk in the
    foothills of the Aldanna
    Range. Vicious and violent,
    should be considered
    dangerous in the extreme!
    Those without faith in their
    sword arm, give this one
    wide berth."

~ Jylland Defenders of the Peace

   Objective:
 - Defeat Gilmunto.

   Forbidden:
 - Fire: Weapons and abilities
   that use fire are forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Worgen x2
 - Yellow Jelly x1
 - Thunder Drake x1
 - Gilmunto (Asp) x1

   Your team will come across
   Gilmunto and friends in the
   midst of a bunch of mist!
   There are new monsters here,
   but none of them are
   particularly challenging.
   Anyway, send in four more
   units in addition to Luso and
   Adelle. Feel free to remove
   Adelle if you don't like her.

   The two Worgens are capable
   of using Fang and nothing
   else. Their physical attack
   is fairly powerful, so keep
   your guard up. However, don't
   prioritize them because they
   aren't as dangerous as the
   other monsters here. The
   Yellow Drake, for one, can
   use Shockbolt, which Confuses
   and Addles its target!
   Thunder Breath is also a
   strong attack that deals
   damage to a "T"- shaped area
   in front of it.

   The Yellow Jelly can cast
   Thunder, and it is also
   fitted with Absorb Damage,
   which replenishes 10% of HP
   damage taken. Since a few of
   the monsters here are
   lightning-based, it will act
   as a healer by casting
   Thunder on its allies. For
   that reason, kill the Yellow
   Jelly as early as possible.

   Defeating Gilmunto is the
   objective, but he's pretty
   tough to defeat. Try to
   eliminate the other enemies
   first before going for him.
   All of the other monsters are
   weak to water, so use water-
   based attacks if possible. As
   for Gilmunto himself, be wary
   of Lightning and Thunder
   Breath. Both are very
   powerful lightning-based
   attacks. Gilmunto can also
   use Dragon Force, which
   raises attack and magick. He
   boasts a ton of HP, so you'll
   want to focus all of your
   attacks on him. If you have
   holy-based attacks available,
   by all means, use them!

   Note that there's a treasure
   chest at the lower-left
   corner of the battlefield.

Having defeated Gilmunto, that
mage Lezaford will show up, and
oh man he is a freaky looking
guy. He'll bring you back to his
cabin.

There, he will ask to see your
journal, which according to
Lezaford, is the key to
returning to Ivalice. In order
to do so, you must first fill
all its pages to release the
powerful magick hidden within.

Return to Graszton to see Cid
again. There, Adelle will bring
up the auction, which is a whole
new aspect of the game in
itself. It's essentially a
bidding system where you can bid
for areas. Become region master
and you will be given the
opportunity to auction for items
- some of these items are very
rare and can be attained through
this method much earlier.
Needless to say, you should look
into it.

However, you won't be able to
access the Auction House for
now, so don't worry about it.
The Rupie Mountains have been
unlocked. They can be accessed
from the Galerria Deep.

Baptiste Hill.

    our woods of an infestation
    of bombs! With auction
    season upon us, who doesn't
    want a few more clan points
    in the bank?"

         ~ Society for Woodland
         Preservation

   Objective:
 - Defeat all foes!

   Forbidden:
 - Restoring MP: Actions that
   restore MP are forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Red Marshmallow x1
 - Floating Eye x2
 - Bomb x3

   The party stumbles upon the
   Zedlei Forest absolutely
   teeming with Bombs and other
   monsters. Consider sending in
   units with ice-based
   abilities because the
   majority of monsters here are
   weak to that element.
   Equipment with resistance to
   fire would be helpful as
   well.

   Floating Eyes are the only
   neutral monsters on the
   field. Well, that's actually
   a lie because they are weak
   to earth and holy-based
   attacks. These monsters are
   capable of using Gnaw to
   inflict Poison status. Their
   other ability, Death Dive, is
   a suicidal desperation attack
   that kills the user and deals
   heavy damage to the target.
   The Floating Eyes typically
   use this attack when they are
   low on HP. To avoid getting
   hit by it, try to kill the
   Floating Eyes without leaving
   them in critical health.

   The Bombs and the Red
   Marshmallow work hand in
   hand. All of them are fire-
   based, so expect to be hit
   constantly by Fire and Flame
   Attack. The Red Marshmallow
   has a skill called Unction
   which inflicts Oil status.
   This can be devastating,
   considering the fact that
   most of the monsters here can
   hit you with fire-based
   attacks. For that reason,
   focus first on the Red
   Marshmallow before it can use
   Unction to coat your units
   with oil. Its defense is
   fairly high, so use spells to
   deal more damage to it.
   Blizzard/ Blizzara/Blizzaga
   works very well against it.

   When focusing on the Bombs,
   be wary of their Self-
   destruct ability, which they
   use when they're in critical
   health. This ability deals
   heavy damage to all units
   surrounding the Bomb. To
   lower the chances of a Bomb
   using it, avoid putting it in
   critical health unless you're
   sure you can kill it before
   its next turn comes. One of
   the Bombs, however, has
   Critical: Quicken, which will
   automatically give it the
   next turn if its health gets
   too low. Should this happen,
   you can count on it to use
   Self-destruct the next turn.
   To avoid this, either kill
   the Bomb without putting it
   in critical health status
   with a powerful attack or
   fight it from a distance.

Adelle will mention that auction
season is starting soon. She
will explain some
characteristics of the auctions
before suggesting you head off
for Camoa or Graszton to try one
for yourself. It doesn't matter
if you win or lose - this first
auction is just an introductory
auction.

The region of Moorabella will
subsequently be unlocked. It can
be access from the Rupie
Mountains or Zedlei Forest.


      M O O R A B E L L A
      O-----------------O
   The magick city of Moorabella
   and its aerodrome

From Moorabella, you can proceed
into the Ruins of Delgantua.

 This sprawling ruin is thought
 to date back to the Galtean

   The lost arts of that time
   are evident throughout.

      ~ Galerria Jewelers

   Objective:
 - Defeat the Lord of the
   Flowsand!

   Forbidden:
 - Actions by Nu Mou: Nu mou may
   only move and perform basic
   attacks.

   Enemies:
 - Antlion (spawns)
 - Pit Beast (spawns)
 - Flowsand Lord (Yowie) x1

   Depending on your characters'
   levels, this battle may range
   from excruciatingly difficult
   to only mild challenging. If
   your units are at least level
   25, I'd say you should be
   able to finish the mission
   comfortably. You will want to
   bring a healer. Units capable
   of casting Protect and
   buffing defenses are strongly
   recommended here as well.

   The Lord of the Flowsand is
   essentially a huge mouth in
   the ground. It's situated at
   the very lowest point in the
   cavern, so you'll have a lot
   of walking to do in order to
   reach it. In addition, you
   will have to contend with a
   few Antlions and Pit Beasts
   that will constantly spawn.
   The Antlions can use a
   variety of attacks, including
   Bile, which lowers
   resilience, and Mucus, which
   inflicts Slow. The Pit
   Beasts, on the other hand,
   can only use Sandstorm, which
   damages an area and inflicts
   Blind.

   The Flowsand Lord will prove
   to be hard to take down,
   primarily due to his
   excessively high HP. His
   abilities include Gravity
   Flux, an attack that hits all
   units on the screen for
   moderate damage. Out of all
   his abilities, this one is
   the least dangerous. Stun
   Crush is an attack that
   damages surrounding units and
   Immobilizes them. This can
   put you in a bad spot because
   it'll Immobilize you while
   your units are still
   surrounding it, giving it
   more opportunities to Stun
   Crush repeatedly. Lastly,
   Draw In is a ranged attack
   that picks up a unit and
   moves it next to the Flowsand
   Lord while dealing moderate
   damage. This can be an issue
   for ranged units, but it can
   be avoided by staying out of
   the attack's range. Note that
   the Flowsand Lord is weak to
   wind-based attacks - take
   advantage of that.

   There are numerous strategies
   you can use for this mission.
   First of all, ignore the
   Antlions and Pit Beasts -
   instead, focus all of your
   units on the Flowsand Lord.
   If possible, inflict Disable
   on or Stop the other monsters
   to prevent them from causing
   too much trouble.

   The first method would be to
   gather up all of your
   strongest physical units and
   surround the Flowsand Lord
   with them. Then, move any
   healers and buffers behind
   them, casting Protect and
   raising defenses as they go.
   It would help if your
   physical units had Counter as
   an R-Ability to deal extra
   damage. In this situation,
   the Flowsand Lord will
   probably mostly make use of
   Stun Crush to damage
   surrounding units. It's a
   fairly powerful attack, so
   make sure your healers are
   doing their job.

   Alternatively, you can send
   in a team of ranged units
   with ranges OVER six tiles.
   The Flowsand Lord's Draw In
   ability has a maximum range
   of six tiles. If you position
   your units in such a way as
   to stay out of his range, you
   can fire at it with impunity,
   only having to worry about
   Antlions and Pit Beasts. This
   is a viable strategy, but it
   only works if your units have
   the adequate range.

With the Flowsand Lord out of
the way, Adelle and Luso (mostly
just Luso...) will search the
glowing moss, along with
Adelle's pearls. Eventually,
they'll find it. Return to
Graszton, and Cid suggests that
you travel to the Rupie
Mountains. Unfortunately, no new
areas are available, but there
are a ton of new missions at the
pub. The next actual story
mission is Mountain Watch...

   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~
   - MOUNTAIN WATCH -
   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~

   "Kuknir Travel is looking for
   guards to escort touring
   groups headed for
    the Rupie Mountains. The
    Marsa Wayfarers Association
    has been gaining on them of
    late. Kuknir want safety as
    a selling point, most like."

   Objective:
 - Defeat Ewen!

   Forbidden:
 - Ice: Weapons and abilities
   that use ice are forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Assassin x1
 - Ninja x1
 - Time Mage x1
 - Sniper x1
 - Nightfall (Ewen) x1

   The Nightfall, at first,
   offers to purchase your judge
   for two million gil. When
   Luso refuses, he brings in
   his team to force the judge
   from you. With that, he
   incapacitates your judge.
   Your clan privilege is now
   negated along with the
   ability to revive dead units.
   Essentially, you're fighting
   without a judge here, so you
   will need to play more
   cautiously.

   Ewen is the objective here.
   If you want to get this
   mission over with quickly,
   then focus all of your
   attacks on him. He can use a
   variety of Ninja abilities,
   including Throw, which tosses
   a weapon at a target, Earth
   Veil, which deals earth
   damage and inflicts Slow, and
   Unspell, which dispels a
   target. His attack stat
   overall is not too high, but
   his Impervious P-Ability
   blocks from many debuffs.

   The other enemies here
   include a Ninja, who boasts a
   more varied list of Ninjutsu
   techniques than the
   Nightfall, Ewen. He can cast
   Fire Veil for fire damage and
   Confuse status, Gold Veil for
   damage and Blind status, and
   Water Veil for water damage
   and Silence status. His Dual
   Wield ability makes him even
   more of a danger than Ewen
   is. You'll want to take him
   down as quickly as possible.
   At least Silence him to
   prevent him from using his
   "Veil" abilities.

   Watch out for the Assassin's
   Ague ability, which can
   inflict Slow. Aphonia
   inflicts Silence status and
   Leg Shot inflicts Immobilize
   status. If you're susceptible
   to status ailments, then
   you'll want to maintain your
   distance from her. The Time
   Mage acts as the healer for
   the enemy team - he can cast
   Cure. His Time Magick
   includes Haste and Reflect.
   He often Hastes Ewen and the
   other units, who are already
   speedy enough as they are.
   Silence him to disable him
   completely.

   Lastly, the Sniper can use
   Leg Shot and Beso Toxico,
   which inflicts Poison status.
   Compared to the other units,
   she isn't nearly as
   dangerous, so feel free to
   ignore her completely.

   There's no need to really
   bother with the other units
   if you don't feel like
   getting the loot and EXP.
   Eliminate Ewen and be done
   with it!

Ewen turns tail and runs
following his defeat. That's to
be expected of him. After the
fight, Luso stumbles upon an odd
jewel, which he decides to take
back to Cid. The good news is
that the judge is still okay -
the effects of Ewen's spell only
disabled him temporarily.

Return to Graszton, and Cid will
tell Luso to get it appraised.
Cid also brings up the Aerodrome
in Moorabella, where you can
take an airship. Now, head over
to Moorabella and go into town.
Upon getting it appraised, Luso
will suggest heading over to the
Aerodrome. Unfortunately, some
streetears state that the
airships have been grounded due
to hardware problems. Looks like
you are stuck...

The next storyline mission is
Grounded! When you are prepared
to continue, accept it and head
to the Aerodrome.

   =~=~=~=~=~=~=
   - GROUNDED! -
   =~=~=~=~=~=~=

   "Airship malfunction due to
   mechanical sabotage and
   inspections resulting
    from same have grounded our
    regular flight to Fluorgis.
    The party or parties
    responsible have yet to be
    apprehended. Calling all
    clans to aid us!"

~ Moorabella Aerodrome Security

   Objective:
 - Defeat Genius Ed!

   Forbidden:
 - Harming the Weak: Actions
   that harm a lower level unit
   are forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Berserker x1
 - Time Mage x1
 - White Mage x1
 - Fusilier x1
 - Genius Ed (Sage) x1

   The perpetrator is Genius Ed,
   a Sage who's been modifying
   the airships. A new face will
   show here. Yes, it's Vaan
   from Final Fantasy XII, ready
   to claim the "treasure" on
   the airship for himself. As
   Luso and Vaan bicker to each
   other, Genius Ed will call in
   his lackeys. After some more
   "painful" dialogue, the
   battle will finally commence.
   Sheesh.

   The primary objective is
   Genius Ed, but you may want
   to take on the other units to
   make things a bit easier.
   Vaan will help out but won't
   really be much assistance.
   First of all, the White Mage
   has to go because he can cast
   Cure and Esuna. Afterwards,
   you should immediately target
   the Time Mage, who can cast
   Quicken and Slow. Since both
   spellcasters don't have very
   high defenses, you should be
   able to dispatch both quite
   easily. Just try to avoid
   being Slowed.

   Be wary of the Berserker.
   Smite of Rage deals damage
   while inflicting various
   debuffs. His HP is quite
   high, so you will need to
   focus your efforts to take
   him down quickly. The Moogle
   Fusilier will prove to be a
   problem with his Blindshot
   and Silenceshot techniques,
   both capable of inflicting
   their own eponymous status
   ailments. He otherwise isn't
   dangerous at all, so
   considering inflicting Addle
   or Disable on him to save the
   trouble of actually
   eliminating him.

   And finally, Genius Ed the
   Sage is capable of casting
   Water, which deals water
   damage, Aero, which deals
   wind damage, and Bio, which
   deals poison damage with a
   chance of inflicting Poison.
   His Immunity renders him
   resistant to certain debuffs,
   so don't count on Silencing
   him. Note that he also has
   Critical: Quicken set as a
   R-Ability. By eliminating him
   in without putting him in
   critical status, you can
   bypass it.

With Genius Ed defeated, another
Final Fantasy XII veteran will
show up. Yes, it's Penelo! As
the two leave, Vaan will mutter
something about Tramdine Fens.
This location will prove to be
important later on.

The Aerodrome is now open,
meaning you can fly over to
Fluorgis. Pay the one- way
ticket fee of 300 Gil to be off.
Just as Luso and Adelle are
about to board the airship, Cid
will show up. Prior, he had
fought as a guest, but now he
will actually join your party!
Anyway, off to Fluorgis!


        F L U O R G I S
        O-------------O
   Quaint shops and age-old
   houses line the streets
  of Fluorgis. Beyond the city,
  ruins of once might fortress
stand watch over the wilderness.


Many of the outlying areas are
also available for travel. Feel
free to explore if you'd like.
There are many new missions at
the pub that you can choose to
do. Whatever the case, accept
the Rumors Abroad mission when
you are ready to see just what
Vaan was talking about when he
mentioned Tramdine Fens.

   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=
   - RUMORS ABOUND -
   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=

   "Rumors whisper of an
   unimaginable treasure
   sleeping deep within Tramdine
    Fens. Some say it is the
    Dozen-and-One Knights of
    Aisen's hoard, others that
    it is a cache of Rozarrian
    wealth... Whets the palate,
    does it not? Well? In the
    mood for a treasure hunt?

      ~ Kanaq, Pub Regular

    * No evidence has been found
      to support above rumors. ~
      The Management"

   Objective:
 - Defeat all foes!

   Forbidden:
 - Copycat: Using the same
   action as the preceding unit
   is forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Zombie x1
 - Floating Eye x2
 - Ghost x2
 - Wraith x1

   While out searching for the
   rumored treasure, the team
   encounters a group of ghosts.
   For this mission, units with
   holy-based attacks are
   strongly recommended. White
   Mages and Archers/White
   Monks/Paladins with Burial/
   Exorcise/Sanctify would help
   here as well. Avoid bringing
   in Moogles or Nu Mou because
   there is too much water here
   (Moogles and Nu Mou cannot
   cross water).

   The Zombie is not a threat in
   this mission - it can use
   Drain Touch to sap HP from
   its target to replenish its
   own HP. You should leave the
   Zombie for last. As for the
   two Floating Eyes, you will
   want to be wary of Death
   Dive, a powerful, suicidal
   attack that they use when in
   critical HP (they both have
   Critical: Quicken). Try to
   avoid putting these monsters
   in critical status for that
   reason. Their other abilities
   are Supersonic Wave, which
   can inflict Silence status,
   and Gnaw, which has a chance
   of inflicting Poison.

   The two Ghosts are capable of
   inflicting Sleep and Silence
   status with Sleep Touch and
   Silence Touch. Lastly, the
   Wraith can use Flash to
   inflict Blind status on
   surrounding units and Wake
   the Dead, which calls in more
   undead monsters. In addition,
   it can cast Darkra on its
   undead brethren to heal their
   HP. You should target the
   Wraith first because it's the
   most dangerous monster
   overall. Avoid putting it in
   critical status though, for
   Critical: Vanish will
   activate, preventing you from
   targeting it.

   All monsters here are weak to
   holy-based attacks. The
   undead (Zombie, Ghost,
   Wraith) are also damaged by
   curative spells. When you
   take down any of the undead,
   a gravestone will remain.
   After about two turns, the
   undead monster will revive
   itself. There are ways to
   deal with this. Exorcise and
   Burial can both banish the
   gravestone, preventing the
   monster from reviving itself.
   Also, using a Phoenix Down
   can work as well.

Something odd will happen after
the battle. After swallowing an
orb, Luso will collapse, and you
will witness a scene from the
real world. Soon thereafter,
Luso wakes again in a hut in the
Tramdine Fens.

Once you regain control, head to
any town to rest. You will see a
few more flashbacks from Luso's
past in the real world, along
with some of the earlier scenes
in Ivalice. The last dream,
however, is a nightmare, likely
brought on by that strange orb
back in the Tramdine Fens. Cid
remarks that someone with a
similar problem had posted a
bill in the pub. Perhaps it
could be some help?

Complete as many of the side
missions as you'd like. When you
are prepared to continue, select
Sleepless Nights and head to the
Nazan Mines.

   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~
   - SLEEPLESS NIGHTS -
   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~

   "My dreams have been troubled
   of late.
    It started the night after
    my visit to Nazan Mines. I
    cannot sleep, my arms and
    legs are leaden, and even
    plump Bisga game-hen tastes
    like ash. They say a
    creature within the mines
    weaves ill-omened dreams. I
    fear... I fear I may be a
    victim. Please, stop it
    before I go mad."

      ~ Dabool, Geologist

   Objective:
 - Defeat the Oversoul!

   Forbidden:
 - Debuffs: Debuffs are
   forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Zombie x1
 - Wraith x2
 - Bloody Orb x1
 - Oversoul x1

   The source of the nightmares
   appears to be an Oversoul.
   The monster will call in a
   team of primarily undead
   foes. For that reason, you
   should send in units with
   holy-based attacks. To banish
   the undead for good, consider
   sending units with Burial,
   Sanctify, or Exorcise.
   Restorative spells deal
   damage to undead monsters, so
   send in White Mages and the
   like as well. In order to
   finish this mission, you must
   defeat the Oversoul.

   The Zombie is capable of
   using Drain Touch to sap the
   target's HP to replenish its
   own. Overall, it isn't very
   dangerous. If you're looking
   to finish the mission
   quickly, it would be best to
   ignore the Zombie completely,
   for your objective is only
   the Oversoul. The Bloody Orb
   is similar in that its sole
   ability, Vampire, saps HP
   from the target to heal
   itself. The Bloody Orb is the
   least threat because its
   attack power is very low in
   comparison to the other
   enemies.

   Be careful of the Wraiths'
   Flash ability. This move
   inflicts Blind status on
   surrounding units. Their
   other ability, Wake the Dead,
   can summon more undead
   monsters. The Wraiths will
   frequently use Dark to heal
   themselves and the other
   monsters that absorb dark
   (the Zombie and Oversoul).
   Both Wraiths have Blood
   Price, meaning HP is consumed
   instead of MP. Finally, the
   Oversoul itself has a variety
   of malicious abilities. Deep
   Sleep inflicts Stop and Sleep
   status, and Shackle inflicts
   Disable and Immobilize
   status. Be prepared to use
   Esuna/Esunaga or Refresh to
   remove any debuffs that it
   inflicts on you. In addition,
   the Oversoul can cast Darkga,
   a powerful dark-based spell
   that deals heavy damage. Much
   like the Wraiths, the
   Oversoul frequently uses it
   to heal itself and the other
   undead.

   All of the monsters here are
   weak to holy-based attacks.
   The undead monsters (which is
   all enemies sans Bloody Orb).
   Recall that when an undead
   monster is killed, it can
   regenerate itself in a few
   turns. In order to prevent
   any downed monsters from
   reviving, use
   Exorcise/Sanctify/Burial to
   banish the monster forever.
   If you use those abilities on
   the tombstone of a downed
   undead monster, you will have
   no chance at missing.

   The sole objective here is
   the Oversoul. Feel free to
   completely ignore the other
   monsters. Both the Zombie and
   Bloody Orb are too weak to
   pose any significant threat
   in this battle, though you
   may find it easier to just
   kill them off quickly. The
   Wraiths, with their Flash
   ability, can be a nuisance,
   so you should eliminate them
   early on. When the Oversoul
   is defeated, the mission will
   end.

Defeating the Oversoul
successfully gets rid of the bad
dreams, as the odd orb that
floated into Luso's body after
the incident at the Tramdine
Fens leaves. You will witness a
few flashback scenes, which
involve Adelle, Cid, and
Lezaford. After that, go to any
pub, and you'll encounter a
Moogle bard by the name of
Hurdy. As he leaves, he will
post up a bill. That bill,
Making Music, is the next
storyline mission. When you are
ready, select it and make your
way to Aisenfield.

   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~
   - MAKING MUSIC -
   =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~

   "The timber of the strawood
   trees growing near Fluorgis
   makes the best
    instruments, kupo! You'll
    get some for me, won't you,
    kupo? Oh, thank you! Thank
    you!
    * Oh, if you find some
      flutegrass too, that'd be
      awful nifty, kupo!

    ~ Hurdy, Itinerant Bard

   Objective:
 - Defeat the Alchemist!

   Forbidden:
 - Harming Females: Actions that
   harm viera and gria are
   forbidden.

   Enemies:
 - Raptor x1
 - Ranger x1
 - Golem x2
 - Alchemist x1

   Luso manages to find the
   strawood, but he also
   encounters a hostile
   Alchemist with a bunch of
   monsters on his side. Just
   your luck, huh? Send in units
   with high defense stats
   because the primary threat on
   the enemy team are the
   formidable Golems - these
   monsters can pack a huge
   punch.

   The law specifically states
   that harming female units is
   forbidden. For that reason,
   you will have to ignore the
   Gria Raptor if you want to
   uphold the law. She is a
   nuisance with her Raptor
   abilities, but overall, she
   is not a significant threat.
   She has a tendency to use
   Power Crush, which is bad
   news for your units since it
   lowers defense in the
   process. The Ranger is
   irritating, since he can put
   down Sten Needle and Leech
   traps. Additionally, he can
   use Mirror Items to inflict
   damage through items, but
   that technique is rarely
   used.

   The two Golems boast high
   attack stats, so they should
   be avoided as best you can.
   Their abilities include Bone
   Shatter, which deals heavy
   damage and delays the
   target's next turn, Sunder
   Earth, which deals earth
   damage in a straight line,
   and Brute Strength, which
   raises the Golem's attack
   power in the next round.
   Consider attacking the Golems
   with ranged units to avoid
   getting knocked out by their
   high-power attacks. Use wind-
   based attacks because the
   Golems are weak to that
   element.

   Of course, the Alchemist is
   the target, but he is not
   very powerful himself. His
   only Alchemy techniques
   include Astra, which grants
   Astra status to his allies
   (makes unit impervious to all
   status ailments) and Rasp,
   which deals MP damage.
   However, he can use the Beast
   Lore ability Headless to take
   control of the Golems
   himself. Other than that, he
   is hardly a threat.

As Luso Leaves the strawood
forest, he remembers that Hurdy
wanted Flutegrass too. This
detail is important, as you will
see later on. Return to any pub
to find Hurdy. He will gladly
take the strawood, and he
requests that you take it to a
Bazaar to turn it into an
instrument. He will give you a
Spiral Vine, along with 2500
gil, to pay for it.

However, if you recall, Hurdy
mentioned Flutegrass before.
Hurdy's Request has two possible
instruments you can make. With
the Spiral Vine, you can make
the Brilliant Theorbo
instrument, which teaches the
Bard skill, Soul Etude and some
Beastmaster techniques. However,
you can also obtain the
Flutegrass, which can be used to
make the Shining Lute.

How do you get the Flutegrass?
Easy. Head over to the Sant
D'alsa Bluff without creating
the Brilliant Theorbo, and you
will come across a continuation
of the Making Music quest, in
which you'll fight a group of
Sprites, Dreamhares, and Lamias.
After defeating these monsters,
you will obtain the Flutegrass.

It is up to you which instrument
you choose to create. Since only
one Strawood can be obtained in
the entire game, you cannot
possibly create both the Shining
Lute and the Brilliant Theorbo.
However, both instruments can be
acquired later in the game.
Personally, I would recommend
the Shining Lute since it
teaches the Bard skill Magick
Ballad, which restores MP to a
unit, along with the Animist
ability, Friend. It is your
choice. Regardless of which
instrument you make, Hurdy will
ask to travel with you
afterwards.

Return to Moorabella to meet
with the appraiser at last.
Adelle will go off by herself to
the pub, where a weird lady will
approach and ask her to work for
her. Adelle refuses, and the
lady leaves. Cid and Luso arrive
shortly thereafter. The magicite
that Ewen dropped was apparently
stolen, and there is a bill at
the pub seeking its rightful
return. The next mission in line
is Seeking the Stone.

| |=============================
| |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
|_|=============================

In addition to the mandatory
storyline missions, there is a
plethora of extra side-quests
available as well. Because there
are no random clan encounters,
you will have to rely on some of
these extra missions to level up
and gain ability points.

Note that only 300 missions are
recorded in the clan log.
However, there are about 100
more missions that are not
recorded, which totals about 400
missions in all.

    * NOTE: Obviously, each
      mission can be defeated in
      many ways. Most of the
 strategies presented here are
 my personal methods of clearing
 the missions. Therefore, don't
 assume you're under any
 obligation to follow my exact
 directions, for there can be an
 infinite number of ways to
 finish each mission.

()------------------------------
||                            5.
()------------------------------

The mission report does not go
in numerical order. Rather, it
employs a chart thingy (that
really makes writing out this
part of the guide more difficult
than it should be). On the
report, you'll notice squares
with letters a-e running from
left to right and numbers 1-5
running top to down. There are
25 of these squares in all
(simple math would lead you to
that). Inside each of these
squares are 16 more squares.
Each individual mission takes up
a spot in each of these squares.

The mission list that follows
will employ a numerical system
for the smaller squares inside
each of the bigger squares.
 ___ ___ ___ ___
    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | For
    example A1-01 would refer to
    the mission in the
    |___|___|___|___| upper-left
    box of the A1 box. This
    mission is Stranger | 5 | 6
    | 7 | 8 | in the Woods,
    which just so happens to be
    the first |___|___|___|___|
    mission of the game. Not
    only does the mission report
    | 9 | 10| 11| 12| log
    completed missions, but it
    also logs pending
    |___|___|___|___| missions
    that have not yet been
    completed. Included | 13|
    14| 15| 16| is data relating
    to the loot collected from
    the mission
    |___|___|___|___| and other
    information regarding rank.

 * NOTE: I can't confirm that
   every mission appears exactly
   when I
 specify (as they are purely
 based on when I encounter
 them). For that reason, a few
 of them may be off the mark. If
 you have any corrections
 relating to anything, please
 notify me. Of course, credit
 will be given.

 * NOTE: Note that certain
   missions vary depending on
   the month. If you
 can't seem to get a mission to
 appear when it's supposed to
 appear, try waiting through the
 months until it shows up.

 * NOTE: All repeatable missions
   will be marked with [R].

 * NOTE: All mission fees do not
   consider fee discounts from
   clan trials
 and auctions.

And in case it becomes
confusing, I'll use directions

        [target]

  This first battle serves as a
  tutorial for those who are
  unfamiliar with the mechanics
  of battle. If you've played
  FFTA before, then you should
  already be familiar with the
  general battle system.
  However, if you have
  absolutely no idea how to
  play, then I'd strongly
  suggest reading the
  instructions carefully. It's
  really not hard to
pick up once you understand it.

  You have control over Luso,
  the Viera White Mage and the
  Nu Mou Black Mage. The other
  dude, Cid, will act on his own
  accord. As part of the
  tutorial, you'll be forced to
  hit Klesta (which is a
  Crushatrice) with a Fire
  spell. To finish the battle,
  all you have to do is defeat
  Klesta. Since Luso is a new
  Soldier, he won't have any Art
  of War techniques available
  right now. Rather, you will
  have to rely on physical
  attacks at the moment. Before
  going straight for Klesta, you
  can target the two Cockatrice
  monsters, and get rid of them
  first.

  Once they are out of the way,
  you can focus your efforts on
  the big bird himself, Klesta.
  He is fairly powerful, so be
  prepared to heal using your
  White Mage (Cure). Watch out
  for his Territorial Marking
  and Peck attacks; both are
  moves that deals damage over
  an area. Do not group your
  units together to avoid taking
  unnecessary damage. You only
  need to bring Klesta down to
  about a quarter HP before it
  flies off.

  While looking to gather a
  muskmallow, your team runs
  into a group of monsters. You
  know the drill. Bring in six
  units to engage the enemy. The
  objective here is not to
  defeat all of the monsters,
  but to find just one sample of
  muskmallow. See the sparkly
  things on the ground? When you
  approach one, you can examine
  it. Only one of them holds the
  muskmallow - all of the others
  contain nothing but gross
  plants. When you find the
  muskmallow, the mission will
  end.

  When the battle begins, be
  sure to snag the contents of
  the chest right next to your
  starting position. There's
  also a pot along the left side
  of the map that you should
  check as well.

  The monsters won't pose a
  problem in this battle. You
  should still try to defeat
  most of them because it will
  make searching for the
  muskmallow much easier. Be
  wary of the Baknamy though,
  for he has a skill called
  Magick Hammer, which deals
  damage to MP. If possible,
keep spellcasters away from it.

  Oh no, wolves! If you are
  unfamiliar with laws, listen
  to Cid's explanation before
  the battle begins. This time
  around, fire is banned,
  meaning you can't use any
  fire-based ability in battle.
  Otherwise, you'll suffer a
  stiff penalty. You will also
  be introduced to clan
  abilities, which can be
  selected before each battle
  begins.

  Select four extra units to
  bring into battle. This fight
  is not too difficult, so
  there's no extensive strategy
  involved. After selecting
  units, pick a clan privilege.
  For this fight, I'd suggest
  Power Up 1. When you are ready
  to go, start the battle.

  There are three targets you
  have to kill. The two Wolves
  are weak, so focus on them
  first. At the moment, you
  probably do not have two many
  abilities available. For now,
  just whack the monsters with
  your strongest units. If you
  brought a Black Mage, use his
  Black Magick. Obviously, you
  can't cast Fire because the
  law forbids it.

  The Baknamy can use Goblin
  Attack, a special ability that
  inflicts damage while ignoring
  defense. The Wolves can use
  Fang, which deals moderate
  damage. If any of your units
  run low on HP, be sure to have
  a White Mage to heal them.
  Eliminate all three targets to
  finish the mission.

          - Soldier x1
          - Warrior x1

  Bring in six units for this
  fight. You are up against a
  few average enemies here. For
  the most part, they shouldn't
  give you too much trouble.
  Both the Soldier and Warrior
  have Rend Power and Rend
  Magick, two debuffs that
  affect attack and magick
  power, respectively. The
  Fencer has two basic
  abilities: Swarmstrike and
  Featherblow. The Archer can
  use Blackout, which inflicts
  Blind status. The Thief can
  use Steal: Gil, which should
  not be much of a threat to
  your party, and lastly, the
  White Monk can use Roundhouse,
  an attack that deals damage to
  surrounding units, and Air
  Render,
   which is a ranged attack.

  Focus on the White Monk first
  because he is closest to your
  starting position. Take care
  not to surround him because he
  can use Roundhouse to damage
  any units around him. Once he
  falls, move to the Archer and
  Fencer. Be wary of the Archer,
  for he can use Blackout, which
  inflicts Blind status.

  You can take on the remaining
  units in any way you see fit.
  None of them are particularly
  threatening, though you may
  want to save the Thief for
  last because he won't do
  anything (except maybe steal
  your gil). Finish off the
  remaining enemies to draw the
  mission to a close.

  Enemies:

          - Viking x2
          - Ranger x1

  As you can see, there are many
  traps strewn across the ruins.
  Luckily, they're all marked
  for you. However, the law
  requires that you move EXACTLY
  three tiles every turn, so you
  may have trouble avoiding
  traps.

  The Berserker on the left is
  capable of using Hone Senses,
  which increases his critical
  rate, Furore, which damages
  surrounding units, and Smite
  of Rage, which is a high-power
  attack capable of inflicting a
  random debuff. The Berserker
  on the right has Ground Shaker
  in place of Smite of Rage.
  Ground Shaker deals damage in
  a line, similar to the Earth
  Render ability of White Monks.
  Both Berserkers have
  exceptionally high attack
  power, so deal with them
  quickly.

  Both Vikings are capable of
  casting Thundara and using
  Strong-arm, a stealing
  ability. Critical: Berserk is
  activated when they get in
  critical status. Neither of
  them are very dangerous unless
  you have any weaknesses
  against Thundara. Lastly, the
  Ranger is capable of laying
  Sten Needle and Love Potion
  traps. Camouflage renders him
  invisible, which can be
  annoying since you'll have to
  wait until he acts again to be
  able to target him. When his
  HP is critical, Critical:
  Vanish will activate, turning
  him invisible automatically.

  All of the Seeqs here have
  Avoid Traps set as a
  P-Ability, so you won't be
  able to lure them into their
  own traps. Eliminate all of
  them the conventional way.
  When they're down, set off the
  marked traps to complete the
  mission. Yellow represents
  Silence traps. Green represent
  Leech (MP damage) traps. Cyan
  represent Sten Needle (HP
  damage) traps.

  Please destroy these traps

  Forbidden:
          - >50 Damage

  Enemies:
          - Sprite x4
          - Banshee x1

  Send in six units for this
  mission. The law forbids any
  damage over 50 HP, so don't
  bring in any units that are
  too strong. The monsters here
  are fairly weak, so there's no
  need for strong units anyway.

  The objective is to disarm the
  traps (indicated by the
  flashing tiles). The only way
  to disarm them is to step on
  them yourself, meaning you'll
  have to take damage in the
  process. For that reason, it's
  best to eliminate the monsters
  first. Otherwise, you might
  have problems (because the
  traps cut out half of your HP;
  minimum damage is 10 HP)
  dealing with both the monsters
  and the traps.

  The Sprites, for the most
  part, are mildly dangerous.
  One of them can use Meteorite,
  which deals a heavy amount of
  damage to a single target. The
  Banshee, too, can use
  Meteorite. It's best to attack
  the Banshee first because she
  has Unscarred, a P-Ability
  that boosts her stats when her
  HP is full. After taking her
  down, focus on the Sprite with
  White Wind - taking her down
  will prevent the monsters from
  healing each other.

  There is a single treasure
  chest located at the lower-
  right corner of the
  battlefield. Be sure to get to
  it before you disarm every
  trap.

  Your party will quickly run
  into the Yellow Wings. They're
  just asking for trouble. Bring
  in four extra units for the
  ensuing battle. I'd suggest
  sending in a White Mage to
  heal. The rest of the party is
  up to you. The law forbids
  anything ice-based, so manage
  your party accordingly. At
  this point in the game though,
  I doubt you have any ice-based
  weapons that could potentially
  trigger it.
Just avoid ice-based abilities.

  The enemy party likely has the
  speed advantage over your
  team. Let them move first.
  It's unlikely that any of them
  will be able to strike you on
  the first turn, so don't worry
  about that. The Animist will
  usually begin the fight with
  100% Wool, which puts Protect
  and Shell on the caster. For
  that reason, you'll want to
  deal with him last because the
  Protect and Shell wear off
  over time.

  The Archer can cast Focus on
  herself, which increases the
  damage on her next attack. The
  remaining units don't have any
  skills to really worry about.
  The Black Mage is capable of
  casting the three basic
  elemental spells though, so do
  not keep your units grouped
  together.

  It is best to take out the
  Black Mage and White Monk
  first because they can deal
  the most amount of damage. The
  White Monk will approach your
  party, so meet him as he
  approaches. By concentrating
  your attacks, the two should
  fall quickly. Next, go for the
  Thief. Lastly, eliminate the
  Archer and Animist. When all
  enemy units have been knocked
  out, the mission will end.

  Bring in six units for this
  battle. Avoid sending in any
  ranged characters because the
  law forbids that. If you have
  any accessories available that
  can block Sleep status, I'd
  suggest equipping them - the
  Lilith in this battle has a
  tendency to use Night, an
  ability that puts all of your
  units to sleep. She also can
  use Kiss, which
   Charms and Dooms a target.

  Be sure to have someone grab
  the treasure that's next to
  the left- most Lamia. There's
  also a pot at the upper-left
  corner of the map.

  Before you focus on the
  Lilith, you'll want to
  eliminate the three Lamias.
  Reason being that the Lilith
  has MP Shield, which allows
  her to take damage in the form
  of MP instead of HP. At the
  end of the battle, you'll want
  to surround her with all of
  your units to swiftly take her
  down.

  The other Lamias aren't much
  trouble. Only one of them has
  an ability (Hand Slap), which
  in itself isn't remarkably
  powerful. The Lamias do have
  fairly strong attacks, so be
  prepared to heal should it
  become necessary. Defeat all
  enemies to draw the mission to

  Out of all the monsters, the
  two Sprites and the Baknamy
  are the least dangerous.
  Either leave them for last or
  finish them off quickly (they
  start closest to you). The
  Wolves can use Fangs, which
  can inflict moderate damage on
  the target. The Werewolf in
  the back is capable of using
  Roar, which removes all buffs,
  and En Garde, which causes the
  Werewolf to assume a defensive
  stance and counter any attacks
  against it. Its defense will
  also rise.

  Avoid attacking the Werewolf
  when it is in En Garde mode.
  Also note that when its HP is
  critical, it'll enter Berserk
  status. You will want to kill
  it quickly before it can get
  another chance to hit your
  party. The remaining enemies
  should not be too difficult to
  kill. Be sure to grab the

  In case you weren't already
  aware, tomatoes (Deadly
  Nightshades) are quite
  vicious. While surveying the
  area, a new face shows up. Cid
  agrees to let her join for a
  fraction of the reward. Much
  like Cid, Adelle is a guest
  who you cannot control.
  However, she will prove to be
  an asset nonetheless. Bring in
  five units of your own in
  addition to the two others.
  This fight is ridiculously
  easy, so don't worry
too much about who to bring in.

  You should focus on the Deadly
  Nightshades first. They are
  speedy little creatures, so
  keep your guard up to prevent
  them from swarming you. These
  Deadly Nightshades can use
  Tomato Tackle, an attack that
  lowers speed, and Tomato Fang,
  which knocks back. Two of them
  can use the Green Magick
  spells, Blind and Raise, and
  the other two have some sort
  of Passive Ability that raises
  attack or defense. Though
  irritating, their low HP makes
  them easy to take down with a
  few strikes.

  The Alraune, however, is a bit
  more formidable. Its Impale
  techniques include Horn Blow,
  which deals moderate damage
  and knocks back, Horn Venom,
  which inflicts poison status,
  and Horn Shot, which is a
  fairly weak attack with an
  increased chance of hitting.
  Its defense stats are slightly
  higher than the Deadly
  Nightshades, but
 it should not pose a problem.

  Be sure to grab the chest at
  the lower-right corner of the
  battlefield before finishing
  off the last monster.

  Forbidden:
           - Using MP

  Enemies:
          - Animist x1
           - Thief x1
        - White Monk x1
        - Black Mage x1
          - Archer x1

  Your first battle is against
  the Yellow Wings.
  Unfortunately, the law
  prevents you from using MP at
  any time, so you will need to
  bring in six non-spellcasters.
  It's recommended that you send
  in units with the abilities to
  inflict restrictive status
  ailments such as Disable,
  Immobilize, etc.

  Out of all the enemy units,
  you will want to watch out
  especially for the White Monk.
  His Air Render ability can
  deal tons of damage. Even
  worse, the attack is ranged,
  meaning he can deliver pain
  from a distance. For that
  reason, you should focus all
  of your attacks on him first.
  Once he's down, the rest of
  the battle should not be very
  difficult at all.

  The enemy Black Mage can use
  the three basic Black Magick
  spells. They are pretty
  powerful, so you should
  prioritize the Black Mage
  early on as well. The Archer
  can use Blackout, which
  inflicts Blind status. If she
  manages to hit you with it, be
  prepared to use Esuna or Eye
  Drops to get rid of the
  condition. As for the Animist,
  he'll often use 100% Wool to
  up his defense and resistance
  and Sheep Count to put your
  units to sleep. He is not
  otherwise dangerous, so leave
  him for the end. The Thief
  won't do much either except
  attempt to steal your gil.
  Defeat all five of the Yellow
  Wing members to finish this
  segment of the Camoa Cup.

  Forbidden:
           - Using MP

  Enemies:
        - Black Mage x3
         - Time Mage x1
        - Green Mage x1

  As you can see, the Edge of
  Magick is made up of mostly
  spellcasters. Since the law
  doesn't apply to the opposite
  side, this battle may prove to
  be difficult. Generally
  though, mages don't have very
  high defense, so your own
  physical strength should shine
  through in this battle.

  Watch out especially for the
  Hume Black Mage - he can cast
  Fira. The other Black Mages
  all have the three basic Black
  Magick spells in addition to
  Geomancy. The Time Mage has
  Haste, and the Green Mage can
  cast Sleep and Blind. I'd
  strongly suggest you
  prioritize the Time Mage
  first, and then work on the
  three Black Mages, starting
  with the Hume Black Mage with
  Fira.

  You should do your best to
  avoid grouping your units
  together. Therefore, the enemy
  mages won't be able to screw
  your entire party over by
  dishing out damage over a
  group. Again, take advantage
  of the enemy team's lower
  defenses and tear them apart
  with physical attacks.

  The most effective strategy
  here would be cast Reflect on
  all of your party members.
  Doing so will basically negate
  all enemy attacks against you.
  Berserking or Silencing the
  enemy team is also be a good
  strategy.

  Forbidden:
           - Using MP

  Enemies:
           - Thief x2
          - Warrior x1
        - White Monk x1
        - Black Mage x1

  The Camoa Braves is a tough
  clan to bring down. Many of
  the enemy units have double
  sets of abilities, making them
  even more of a challenge.
  Couple that with the fact that
  many of your units are
  probably hurting from the last
  two challenges, and you have
  quite a
 difficult fight on your hands.

  The heaviest hitter would be
  the White Monk, with his Air
  Render (ranged damage) and
  Earth Render (damage in a
  straight line) abilities. If
  possible, Disable him to
  prevent him from attacking.
  You will also want to be wary
  of the Moogle Thief, who has
  two Moogle Knight abilities at
  his disposal. Moogle Lance is
  a similar skill to Air Render
  and Moogle Attack knocks back.
  He also has Doublehand as his
  P-Ability, which increases his
  damage output.

  The Hume Thief is fitted with
  two Archer abilities: Leg
  Shot, which inflicts
  Immobilize, and Arm Shot,
  which inflicts Disable. He can
  only use them at melee range
  because he's a Thief. The
  Thief is more of a nuisance
  than anything else. Immobilize
  him if possible and let him
  sit there.

  The Warrior is fairly strong,
  capable of using Body Slam,
  which deals heavy damage, and
  Greased Lightning, which
  ignores R-Abilities. Finally,
  the enemy Black Mage is hardly
  a threat. He can only use the
  three basic Black Magick
  spells. You should still avoid
  grouping your units together.
  You can take down the Black
  Mage early on since he's the
  weakest physically.

          - Baknamy x1
          - Lilith x1
           - Ghost x1
          - Wraith x1

  For this battle, you will have
  to contend with a number of
  undead monsters, in addition
  to a Lilith and Baknamy. Send
  in six units. A curative unit
  would be useful here, along
  with any character who has
  Burial or Exorcise to get rid
  of the pesky Ghost and Wraith.
  Make sure you bring in ranged
  units because the second half
  of this mission has a law that
  forbids targeting adjacent
  units.

  At this point in the game, the
  Baknamy should be not be a
  factor whatsoever. It still
  retains its Magick Hammer and
  Goblin Attack abilities. The
  Lilith should be prioritized
  due to its Kiss ability, which
  Dooms and Charms the target.
  Eternal Oblivion, its other
  attack, deals damage over an
  area with a chance of inducing
  Addle status.

  The two undead monsters here
  will constantly cast Dark
  between themselves to restore
  each other's HP. You can deal
  damage to these two by casting
  restorative magick on them.
  When they are taken down, use
  Exorcise or Burial to put them
  down for good. You can't use a
  Phoenix Down for this purpose
  unless you want to break the
  law though. To finish this
  segment of the mission,
  inspect the Stone with No
  Name.

  Forbidden:
   - Targeting Adjacent Units

  Enemies:
          - Baknamy x1
       - Thunder Drake x2
         - Headless x2
          - Zaghnal x1

  You are up against a pretty
  strong force of monsters in
  this battle. This force is
  fronted by a Baknamy that, yet
  again, is no threat. Save it
  for last. The Thunder Drakes
  can use Thunder Breath to deal
  lightning-based damage in an
  area. The two Headless
  monsters behind them can use
  Bone Shatter to deal damage
  and delay the target's next
  turn, Sunder Earth to deal
  earth damage in a line, and
  Brute Strength to raise its
  attack power for the next
  round. Lastly, the Zaghnal is
  capable of using Roar, which
  removes the buffs of all units
  on the screen, Howl, an MP-
  damaging attack with a chance
  of inflicting Confuse, and
  Slug, a high-power attack that
  ignores defense.

  The only really dangerous
  monster here is the Zaghnal,
  which is at the back of the
  pack. Work your way down the
  line, dropping the monsters as
  you go. Be sure to heal when
  necessary and cleanse units
  that get Confused.
  Alternatively, you can just
  attack the unit to
   get rid of Confuse status.

  Enemies:
       - Floating Eye x2
          - Baknamy x1

  Part one of this battle pits
  you against a team of monsters
  protecting the Stone with No
  Name. Bring in six units for
  this battle and begin. This
  segment of the mission is
  really easy.

  The Floating Eyes have a
  couple of annoying abilities
  at their disposal. Supersonic
  Wave can Silence the target
  and Gnaw can Poison the
  target. Also note that when
  you get a Floating Eye to
  critical health, it may use
  Death Dive, a very powerful
  attack that kills the Floating
  Eye in the process. For that
  reason, eliminate the Floating
  Eyes as quickly as possible
  when you reach them. They are
  weak to
 earth and holy-based attacks.

  The Baknamy is a joke. He can
  only use Magick Hammer, which
  deals MP damage, and Goblin
  Attack, which ignores defense.
  At this point in the game, you
  should have no trouble wiping
  the floor with it. After
  defeating it, inspect the
  stone to be warped to an area
  reminiscent of the temple
  encountered in the Star Seal
  mission.

  Forbidden:
     - Bludgeoning Weapons

  Enemies:
          - Baknamy x1
         - Werewolf x2
          - Lilith x2
         - Lamashtu x1

  The opposition in this segment
  of the battle are a bit
  tougher. The Baknamy and
  Werewolves aren't much to
  worry about though. The
  Werewolves can use Roar, which
  removes buffs, En Garde, which
  puts the user in a counter
  stance, Slug, which is a
  powerful attack that ignores
  defense, and Assault, which
  inflicts Immobilize status.
  The two do have a fairly high
  attack stat, so don't let your
  guard down.

  The Liliths and Lamashtu will
  be the biggest threat because
  of their abilities that can
  inflict a number of status
  ailments on the target. The
  only skill that the Liliths
  can use is Kiss, which
  inflicts Doom and Charm
  status. To rid Charm status,
  simply knock the affected unit
  over the head. The Lamashtu is
  capable of using Night, which
  puts ALL units except the
  caster to sleep, and Poisonous
  Frog, which inflicts Toad and
  Poison status. The former is
  quite annoying, but it affects
  all units, so other monsters
  may be put to sleep as well.

  Target the Lamashtu first. It
  has a lot of HP, so you will
  need a few hits to take it
  down. From there, just beat
  down the remainder. Try to
  prioritize the Liliths to
  prevent them from constantly
  kissing you. Out of all the
  monsters, the Baknamy is the
  least dangerous, so leave it
  for last if you must.

  Your six units will start in
  the upper-left corner of the
  battlefield. The field itself
  is shaped like a hollowed-out
  square, so navigating will
  prove to be difficult. Fast
  units and those with high move
  stats are best for this
  mission.

  The objective is to defeat the
  Cyanwolf at the lower-right
  corner. In order to reach it
  though, you will have to fight
  through the other Wolves as
  well. Don't treat them as
  total pushovers though - some
  of them are able to use
  Screech, a ranged attack that
  deals damage with a chance of
  inflicting Confuse status.

  Work your way either along the
  left side or upper side of the
  map, depending on whichever
  side the Cyanwolf is closer
  to. When you reach it, hit it
  with all you've got. Take
  caution, though, for it is
  quite powerful. It is capable
  of using Chilling Blow, which
  deals ice damage
  (unfortunately, monsters are
  not affected by laws) with a
  chance of inflicting
  Immobilize status, and Fiery
  Blow, which deals fire damage
  with a chance of inflicting
  Silence status. Defeat the
  Cyanwolf quickly before it can
  cause too much trouble.

  Enemies:
        - Black Mage x1
        - White Mage x1
          - Soldier x1
         - Blue Mage x1

  The first part of this cup
  puts you up against Humeism, a
  group consisting solely of
  Humes (as their name
  suggests). You can only send
  in four units for the battles
  to come, so make sure they're
  up for the task. A well-
  rounded party is always best -
  a healer is a necessity if you
  plan on finishing the three
  battles comfortably.

  Go after the White Mage and
  Black Mage first. The Black
  Mage poses a serious threat
  with his Fira spell, which can
  easily roast a group of units
  clustered together. Since the
  battlefield doesn't allow much
  room to maneuver, you'll want
  to get rid of the Black Mage
  first to prevent any
  complications. The White Mage
  should also be prioritized to
  prevent the enemy team from
  healing. Both mages don't
  boast very high defense stats,
  so taking them down shouldn't
  be an issue.

  The Blue Mage can use Screech,
  which damages and inflicts
  Confuse, Cornered, which
  inflicts 999 HP damage when
  his HP is in the single
  digits, and Unction, which
  inflicts Oil status. In
  conjunction with the Black
  Mage, Unction can be a real
  pain because it can
  significantly increase the
  effectiveness of the Black
  Mage's Fira spell. All the
  more reason to eliminate the
  Black Mage quickly!

  You can choose to go for the
  Soldier or Blue Mage next. The
  Soldier is fitted with various
  "Rend" abilities that can
  really hinder your team's
  ability to fight effectively.
  Be wary of his Counter
  R-Ability though. As for the
  Blue Mage, avoid putting him
  in the single digits HP range.
  Cornered is devastating (999
  HP damage), especially in a
  mission where your units'
  survival is critical to the
  mission.

  Forbidden:
     - Opportunity Commands

  Enemies:
          - Archer x2
          - Hunter x2

  Houndforce is a group of
  ranged fighters. For that
  reason, none of them are
  particularly powerful, but all
  have a variety of abilities
  that can prove to be serious
  problems. Both of the Archers
  can use Blackout to inflict
  Blind, with the Hume Archer
  also capable of using Leg
  Shot, which inflicts
  Immobilize status. Both have
  Blink Counter as their
  R-Ability. Their attack stats
  aren't high, but the knockback
  from the Blink Counter can be
  irritating.

  The Hume Hunter, in addition
  to his Hunter ability, Advice
  (raises an ally's critical hit
  ratio), is capable of using
  Fighter techniques Beat Down
  and Blitz. Blitz isn't much of
  an issue since it's so weak,
  but Beat Down is problematic
  because it's a powerful
  attack. Its low accuracy is
  fixed by Concentration, which
  raises the Hunter's accuracy
  quite a bit. To prevent him
  from landing too many cheap
  hits with Beat Down, try to
  inflict Blind status on him to
  decrease his chance of
  effectively landing Beat Down.
  Either that or Disable him
  altogether.

  Avoid grouping your units
  together because the Gria
  Hunter can use Sonic Boom to
  deal area damage. Her other
  ability, Vitals Shot, can
  inflict a random status
  ailment. She also has the
  Raptor technique, Speed Crush,
  which deals damage and lowers
  speed. This Gria should be
  prioritized.

  Try your best to inflict as
  many debuffs as possible on
  the enemy team. Successfully
  Disabling some of the enemy
  units allows you to focus more
  on taking out the other units.
  This is not a tough battle
  because none of the opponents
  are very strong, but it can
  prove to be irritating because
  of all the status ailments
  they are capable of hitting
  you with.

  Forbidden:
     - Opportunity Commands

  Enemies:
          - Viking x2
           - Thief x1
          - Juggler x1

  This final bout is quite
  challenging, especially since
  it is the last fight. The
  problem lies mainly in the
  Juggler, who has a variety of
  techniques. Weapon Toss is
  just a simple throwing attack,
  Molotov Cocktail inflicts
  Berserk, Dagger Toss inflicts
  Disable, and Ring Toss
  inflicts Stop. Your best bet
  would be to quickly eliminate
  the Juggler before he can use
  his tricks to drag down your
  team. Either that or Disable
  him right off the bat.

  The Thief can be an issue, not
  for his standard Thievery
  techniques, but for his
  Calling ability, Cuisine. This
  ability fully restores HP.
  Again, try to inflict Disable
  to prevent him from using this
  ability. If that's not
  possible, then prioritize the
  Thief, along with the Juggler.

  The two Vikings are not much
  to worry about in comparison
  to the Moogles. The Viking who
  isn't Lord Grayrl has
  Doublehand, which
  significantly increases his
  damage output. Grayrl can cast
  Thundara whereas the other
  Viking can cast Thunder. Cast
  Shell to increase resistance
  against these spells if they
  pose a problem. After
  eliminating the Moogles, focus
  all of your attacks on these
  two stragglers.

  The Bangaa Brotherhood is a
  clan consisting mostly of
  physical-based units. Send in
  six units of your own that
  have fairly high defenses.
  Since items are forbidden, a
  healer is recommended for this
  battle. Also, any skill that
  raises KOed units can be very
  useful here.

  All of the enemies here are
  dangerous in their own way.
  The Warrior boasts a variety
  of "Rend" abilities that can
  really hinder your attack,
  speed, and magick attack
  stats. His HP is really high,
  so bringing it down will take
  a long time. For that reason,
  don't attempt to fight the
  Warrior directly when the
  battle commences. Instead,
  inflict a debuff on him
  (Disable, Stop, etc.) that can
  prevent him from using his
  "Rend" abilities. Then, you
  can focus on the other units
  without having to worry about
  him. The same can be done for
  the Defender, who (naturally)
  boasts high defense stats. His
  abilities include Hiberate,
  which removes debuffs and puts
  the user to sleep, and Mow
  Down, which deals heavy damage
  to surrounding
 units at the cost of evasion.

  The Gladiator is quite
  powerful. He can use Fire
  Soul, Thunder Assault, and
  Blizzard Tackle. All are
  elemental attacks that aren't
  notably strong. However, if
  any of your units has an
  elemental weakness, these
  attacks may cause problems.
  The Templar is particularly
  troublesome, for he can use
  Piercing Cry to decrease
  speed, Rasp to deal MP damage,
  and Silence.

  You should first prioritize
  the weakest of the enemy
  units. The Cannoneer and
  Bishop both have noticeably
  less HP than the others. The
  former can use Target to raise
  the number of shots his the
  next attack, Mortar to deal
  heavy damage, and Target to
  boost the damage of his next
  shot. As for the Bishop, watch
  out especially for Break,
  which can inflict Stone
  status. Water and Aero deal
  water and wind- based damage,
  respectively. Prevent him from
  petrifying your entire party
  by Silencing or inflicting
  Berserk on him.

  Before finishing off the last
  enemy unit, take some time to
  heal your party back to full
  health. Trust me, you'll need
  all the HP you
 can get for the coming rounds.

  against numerous physical
  units. This fight is just the
  opposite. All of the Nu Mou
  Nobles are capable of
    casting various spells.

  Cast Shell on your party to
  reduce damage taken from
  magick spells. You can choose
  to cast Reflect as well. This
  will deflect many spells,
  including the Black Magick
  you'll be sure to face.
  However, note that Reflect
  also prevents you from healing
  yourself with your own magick.
  Since the entire enemy team is
  magick-based, Silence and MP-
  damaging attacks work great
  here!

  Go straight for the White
  Mage, who is capable of
  casting Cure, Cura, and Esuna.
  Removing him will prevent the
  Nu Mou Nobles from healing
  themselves. Next, you should
  focus on the Illusionist,
  who's various spells can
  damage all of your units.
  Prominence deals fire damage,
  Tempest deals lightning
  damage, and Freezeblink deals
  ice damage. He has Blood
  Price, meaning his HP will
  suffer (Blood Price uses HP in
  lieu of MP). For that reason,
  taking him down should not be
  an arduous task.

  The rest of the battle is up
  to you. The Time Mage isn't a
  high priority because it can
  only cast Haste and Reflect.
  The Black Mage is capable of
  casting the three basic Black
  Magick spells, along with
  Blizzara. He also has Magick
  Counter, so don't hit him with
  any spells! The Arcanist and
  Alchemist are among the most
  powerful magick-casters, with
  the Arcanist capable of
  casting Death, which instantly
  kills a target, Syphon, which
  saps MP and turns it into HP,
  and Graviga, which reduces HP
  by 50%! The Alchemist, on the
  other hand, can cast
  Protometeor, a devastating
  that damages an area, Rasp,
  which deals MP damage, and
  Poison, which inflicts Poison.

  Silence and Berserk debuffs
  help tremendously in this
  battle, but any debuff that
  can prevent the Nu Mou Nobles
  from casting their spells can
  be effective. If applicable,
  use attacks that damage MP to
  hinder their ability to cast
  magick. The thing with
  spellcasters is that there are
  so many weaknesses you can
  take advantage of. When fought
  strategically, they're almost
  powerless to stop you.

  Forbidden:

  Enemies:
          - Sniper x1
           - Sage x1
        - Illusionist x1
          - Dragoon x1
         - Berserker x1
          - Hunter x1

  This final clan is a good mix
  of spellcasters, melee units,
  and ranged units. Hopefully,
  you've healed yourself in the
  previous battle. Otherwise,
  you may have some trouble
  surviving in the early rounds
  of this final bout due to that
  pesky Illusionist.

  Go straight for the
  Illusionist first - his
  Illusions can deal a lot of
  damage to all units on-screen.
  He's physically weak, so you
  should able to sweep him
  before he even has a chance to
  attack. After eliminating the
  Illusionist, I'd suggest you
  take out the Hunter. She can
  use Vitals Shot to inflict a
  random debuff, as well as
  Raptor skills Power Crush and
  Mind Crush, which lower
  defense and magick resistance
  stats, respectively.

  Both the Dragoon and Berserker
  are heavy-hitters. The
  Berserker is capable of using
  Scream, which removes all
  buffs, Furore, which deals
  damage to surrounding units,
  and Smite of Rage, which deals
  damage and inflicts a random
  debuff. That last skill can be
  particularly problematic. As
  for the Dragoon, expect
  standard attacks and the
  occasional elemental "Breath"
  attack. Apart from his high
  attack stats, he's nothing
  really to worry about.

  The Sniper can use Beso Toxico
  to inflict Poison, in addition
  to Doubleshot. Her attack,
  too, is quite strong. And
  finally, the Sage is capable
  of using Water and Aero, which
  deal water and wind-based
  damage - both are fairly mild
  magick spells. Don't mind him
  too much because he really is
  not very powerful in this
  battle.

          - Warrior x1
          - Archer x1

  Send in five units for this
  quest. Your objective here is
  to defend Dayvis the Meek
  (Thief) from the enemy
  bandits. The terrain,
  unfortunately, is pretty tough
  to traverse. Units with good
  jump and
move stats are recommended here.

  This is a mostly uphill battle
  against a generic enemy clan.
  None of the enemies are
  particularly difficult, so
  this is an easy battle
  overall. Attack the White Mage
  first because he can heal the
  party. Then, focus on taking
  out the White Monk and Archer.
  The White Monk can use Air
  Render, which deals moderate
  damage from a range. His other
  abilities are not too
  effective in this battle. The
  Archer, on the other hand, can
  prove to be a nuisance with
  her Leg Shot and Blackout,
  which Immobilize and Blind,
  respectively.

  The Soldier is fitted with a
  variety of Rend debuffs.
  Consider prioritizing him as
  well to prevent him from using
  them. As for the Black Mage,
  don't expect too much out of
  him. He can cast Fire,
  Blizzard, and Thunder. Lastly,
  the Warrior can use Body Slam
  and Greased Lightning, both
  somewhat powerful attacks, but
  nothing to worry about.

  You will need to make your way
  up the cliff in order to reach
  the Archer and some of the
  other units. If possible, make
  your way up along the west
  side of the battlefield. This
  path provides the best way up
  to the enemy party. Be
  prepared to take a couple of
  hits as they attack you from
  their higher position.

  Defeat all enemies while
  protecting Dayvis to complete
  the mission. There are also
  two treasures on the cliff you
  can snag.

  Forbidden:
      - Buffs

  Enemies:
         - Blue Mage x1

  Just a quick note - even
  though the law forbids buffs
  in the first round, the final
  round forbids R-Abilities, so
  make sure you remove any
  R-Abilities now because you
  won't be able to once the
  tourney begins.

  The Fluorgis Cup is a one-on-
  one elimination tourney
  against three clans. Since you
  are only allowed to send in
  one unit, make sure he or she
  is fairly strong and can heal
  if need be. Like the other
  cups, you don't have any time
  in between bouts to switch
  members or restore HP.

  You will first face a Blue
  Mage. His Blue Magick
  abilities include Sandstorm,
  which deals earth damage with
  a chance of inflicting Blind,
  Bad Breath, which can inflict
  Blind, Silence, and Poison
  status, and Dragon Force,
  which raises attack and magick
  power. Needless to say,
  resistances to status ailments
  would help significantly here.
  Should he land any debuffs on
  you, use a ability that
  removes them (Nurse, Esuna,
  etc.).

  The Blue Mage isn't difficult.
  His defense is quite high, so
  you will need to hit him hard
  though. Also, his MP Shield
  transfers the the damage to
  MP, but you should easily be
  able to overpower his MP.

  Forbidden:
     - Fire, Ice, Lightning

  Enemies:
         - Red Mage x1

  Bout number two pits you
  against a Red Mage. She is
  capable of using Doublecast to
  cast either Fire or Silence
  twice in a row. Neither of
  those spells are remarkably
  damaging though (unless you
  have a spellcaster out, in
  which case you should get rid
  of Silence status
  immediately).

  You will, however, want to
  watch out for her Sniper
  technique Doubleshot, which
  can attack twice in one turn.
  Her attack is quite high, and
  it is further augmented by
  Attack Up. If your unit has
  low defense, consider putting
  up a Protect barrier to reduce
  the damage, though stronger
  units should be able to brave
  through it just fine.

  The Red Mage is equipped with
  a Ribbon, so status ailments
  won't affect her. Just hit her
  with your strongest attacks,
  and she should go down easily.
  Eliminate the Red Mage to move
  on to the final bout.

  Forbidden:
      - Reaction Abilities

  Enemies:
        - Master Monk x1

  This Master Monk can use a
  variety of attacks to deal
  heavy damage to your unit.
  Dark Fist is an attack that
  sacrifices HP to deal damage.
  Withering Strike deals more
  damage when the Master Monk is
  at low HP, so watch out for
  that. Lastly, Cross-counter
  deals damage if the target has
  Counter as an R-Ability. Since
  you should have removed that
  at the beginning, this move
  should not be an issue.

  With his Destroyer P-Ability,
  this White Monk will prove to
  be quite difficult. His Orb of
  Minwu (which can be stolen)
  blocks most debuffs (note that
  he can still be Stopped and
  Doomed). To win, you must
  outdamage the Master Monk.
  Withering Strike, at lower HP,
  will be his most dangerous
  attack, though it has horrid
  accuracy. Be prepared to take
  heavy damage in this battle
  though. It is, after all, the
  final bout.

         - Berserker x1
      - Dayvis (Thief) x1

  Your clan encounters a
  familiar face here. The "Meek"
  Dayvis is actually not the
  coward you may have thought he
  was. It's time to finish the
  fight against him. Select six
  units for the fight and begin.

  The terrain is difficult to
  traverse here, so do your best
  to move along the west side of
  the cavern. The land there is
  the most flat and therefore
  easiest to get across.

  Dayvis's clan is not
  remarkably tough to take down.
  The White Monk can use
  Roundhouse and Air Render, and
  the Warrior has three "Rend"
  abilities. Take extra caution
  around the Archer, who can use
  Leg Shot to inflict Immobilize
  status and Blackout to inflict
  Blind status. Her only Sniper
  ability, Wallet Shot, steals
  gil. It would be a good idea
  to Blind her to prevent her
  from effectively debuffing
  your party.

  The Soldier can use Provoke,
  which inflicts Berserk status.
  Prevent your spellcasters from
  getting hit by this ability.
  As for the Berserker, be wary
  of Furore, a powerful attack
  that affects surrounding
  units. His Inner Calm ability
  raises his evasion, which can
  be a nuisance in the middle of
  battle. It's best to leave him
  for last, after taking down
  the rest of the enemy clan.

  Dayvis, for all the trouble
  he's caused, is a joke. Unless
  you're worried about losing
  your smash gauge and gil, you
  shouldn't pay much attention
  to him. Eliminate all enemies
  to draw the mission to a
  close. Note that there are two
  treasure chests on the map,
  but they're in hard-to-reach
  spots. There is also an urn
  hidden near the
enemy clan's starting position.

       - Moogle Knight x1
          - Viking x2
   - Lord Grayrl (Viking) x1

  Send in six units for this
  battle. Unfortunately, the law
  forbids you from harming
  Humes, meaning the Black Mage
  and Archer are off- limits. Of
  course, you can always break
  the law, but there is really
  no need to since your only
  target is the Seeq Viking,
  Lord Grayrl.

  You don't need to attack the
  Humes, but be aware that the
  Archer can use Blackout to
  inflict Blind. The Black Mage
  is not much of a threat - he
  can only cast the three basic
  Black Magick spells. Also, the
  Moogle Knight is not much of a
  threat either. He is only
  capable of using Moogle Guard,
  which raises his defense and
  resistance. His attack stat is
  fairly high, so keep units
  with lower defense stats away.

  Some of the Vikings can cast
  Thunder/Thundara, so use
  equipment with resistance to
  lightning if you want to avoid
  taking damage. All of them can
  use Pickpocket to steal gil,
  and a few can use Strong-arm
  to potentially steal an item.
  Unless you don't like getting
  stolen from, the only real
  threat to your team is Lord
  Grayrl's Thundara spell, which
  can deal quite a bit of
  damage. It can easily be
  averted by inflicting Silence
  on him (or again, wearing
  equipment resistant to
  lightning).

  You cannot allow Lord Grayrl
  to board the ship, so form a
  barrier along the docks. The
  ship is at the lower-left
  corner of the battlefield, so
  Grayrl will have to get
  through your party in order to
  reach it. When Grayrl
  approaches, move your party
  towards him to mob him. He has
  a good amount of HP, so
  concentrate your attacks to
  quickly and efficiently take
  him down.

  status ailments you'll be sure

  equipment resistant to debuffs
  wouldn't hurt either
  (especially Confuse, Stone,
  Charm, and Slow).

  Between the Bloody Orbs and
  the Plagues, the Bloody Orbs
  are the lesser threat. All of
  them are able to use Vampire,
  which drains HP, and
  Supersonic Wave, which
  inflicts Silence. For the most
  part, the only units who
  should take caution around the
  Bloody Orbs are spellcasters.
  The Bloody Orbs' attack isn't
  very remarkable either, so
  don't hold them as a high
  priority.

  The Plagues have three
  abilities you should watch out
  for: these include Glare,
  which inflicts Stone, Demonic
  Gaze, which inflicts Confuse,
  and Bewitching Glance, which
  inflicts Charm and Slow! It
  would not be a bad idea to
  Disable or Stop these Plagues
  before they can manage to
  significantly hinder your
  team. Another thing to note,
  these abilities are all
  ranged, meaning the Plagues
  can debuff you from a
  distance. They only work when
  your unit is looking at them.

      - Chocobo Knight x1

  You should know how these clan
  tournaments go by now. For
  these three battles, send in a
  team that is well-rounded,
  with both physical attackers
  and spellcasters. White Mages
  or any other unit who can
  heal, cleanse, and revive
  fallen units are strongly
  recommended. You will not have
  any time to heal in between
  bouts, so it is imperative
  that you have a support unit
  who can do just that. Also pay
  attention to the law. You do
  not have to follow it, but
  just keep in mind that ending
  the turn next to any other
  unit is forbidden.

  The first bout pits you
  against Wild Kupoon, a team of
  entirely Chocobo Knights. One
  of them is unmounted, so feel
  free to ignore him until
  you've eliminated the others.
  Out of all of them, the Red
  Rider is the most dangerous.
  He can use Choco Meteor, which
  deals heavy damage to a group
  of units. At the start of the
  battle, focus all of your
  attacks on the Red Rider.

  With the Red Rider gone, I
  would recommend that you aim
  for the White Rider, who can
  cast Choco Recharge, which
  restores MP, and Choco
  Barrier, which puts up a
  Protect and Shell barrier. The
  Brown Rider can use Choco
  Guard, which grants Regen
  status and increases defense
  and resilience, while the
  Green Rider can use Choco
  Esuna to cleanse his allies.
  Lastly, the Black Rider can
  cast Choco Flame to deal fire
  damage.

  All of the enemies, except for
  the unmounted leader, are weak
  to water, lightning, and holy-
  based attacks. If you take
  advantage of their weaknesses,
  the battle will go by much
  more quickly. A good idea
  would be to eliminate every
  rider until only the unmounted
  Chocobo Knight remains. Before
  you take him down, use the
  time to heal and restore your
  units back to full health.
  When you are ready to proceed
  into the next bout, strike him
  down.

        - White Mage x1

       - Elementalist x1
        - Spellblade x1

  Violene is a group consisting
  entirely of Viera. At the
  start of the battle, go
  straight for the White Mage.
  Defeating her will prevent the
  enemy clan from healing
  themselves. The rest of the
  battle is up to you, but I
  would personally prioritize
  the Sniper, who can use Death
  Sickle to induce Doom status,
  along with Doubleshot, which
  can really rack up damage.

  The Spellblade is an issue, as
  she can use Sleep Blade, Slow
  Blade, and Confusion Blade,
  which all have a chance to
  inflict their respective
  status ailment. The
  Elementalist can cast Fire
  Whip, which has a chance to
  inflict Disable, Boulder
  Crush, which has a chance of
  inflicting Immobilize, and
  Sliprain, which may induce
  Slow status. Consider casting
  Silence to prevent them from
  using their abilities.

  As for the Green Mage, keep in
  mind that she can cast Sleep.
  Again, cast Silence if you can
  to prevent her from using any
  of her spells. She can also
  use attack with Swallowtail
  and Nighthawk to dish out
  damage. Lastly, the Fencer,
  with her high attack stats,
  can be a threat to your weaker
  units. Her Swarmstrike ability
  may induce Poison status.

  This battle is not
  particularly challenging if
  you use debuffs to your
  advantage. The enemy
  spellcasters can easily be
  disabled by casting Silence on
  them. If you take out the
  White Mage early on, Violene
  will lose their ability to
  heal themselves. Finish off
  this clan to move into the
  third and final bout.

  You are only up against four
  of Prima Donna's members, but
  they all pack quite a punch,
  so don't take this as any easy
  fight. Valentyne, the
  Spellblade is capable of
  attacking with Poison Blade
  and Stun Blade, which can
  Poison and Immobilize,
  respectively. Additionally,
  you will want to be careful of
  Death Sickle, which inflicts
  Doom status. As for Aluette
  the Fencer, eliminate her
  early in the battle to prevent
  the Prima Donna clan from
  healing. Aluette can use Earth
  Heal to replenish HP.

  The Hunter has a few Geomancy
  abilities that can only be
  used based upon conditions.
  Shining Flare can only be used
  in sunlight and Venom Squall
  can only be used in the rain.
  Her other two abilities cannot
  be used since there is not
  grass or earth tiles on this
  tiny battlefield. Keep in mind
  that Venom Squall can inflict
  Poison.

  Finally, the arrogant Prima
  Donna leader, Mayhew, boasts a
  variety of Raptor techniques.
  Soul Crush deals damage to
  both HP and MP, and Shield
  Bash may inflict Disable.
  Cyclone deals wind damage to a
  group of units. And that
  pretty much wraps it up for
  Prima Donna. Fight as you have
  been fighting, and the Goug
  Cup will be yours! You'll
  receive an Ewer of Darkness in
  addition.

     - Fire Drake (spawns)
- Mirage Bunny (Hoppy Bunny) x1

  The Mirage Bunny is defended
  by a whole pack of monsters.
  Needless to say, taking down
  this cute little bunny may
  prove to be more difficult
  than originally thought.

  There's no point in trying to
  kill all of the other monsters
  because they will constantly
  respawn. Heed no attention to
  the Headless monster because
  its speed is too slow to be
  any real threat. It'll often
  use Brute Strength before
  attacking to power up. It is
  strong but if you maintain
  your distance, the Headless
  shouldn't be an issue.

  The Yellow Jelly is capable of
  using Acid to inflict a random
  debuff. Its weak to water-
  based attacks. The Red
  Marshmallow frequently uses
  Unction before it casts Fire
  to boost its damage. However,
  it should also remain a low
  priority because it isn't
  remarkably powerful.

  Be wary of the Thunder Drake,
  which can use Shockbolt to
  inflict Confuse and Addle. The
  Fire Drake, on the other hand,
  can use Mesmerize to inflict
  Charm and lower speed.
  Unfortunately, both drakes
  have very high HP, so it may
  be better to simply Disable
  them as opposed to fighting
  them.

  The Mirage Bunny is not tough
  to kill, though it is capable
  of using Illude to inflict
  Charm status. Notice its
  R-Ability, Critical: Vanish.
  If you activate its R-Ability,
  it will go Invisible on you.
  Invisible renders the Mirage
  Bunny impossible to target
  directly
until it acts and appears again.

    - Florah (Geomancer) x1

  Florah has a bunch of Malboros
  on her side, so status
  ailments will prove to be an
  issue here. Send in units with
  resistances to debuffs to best
  tackle this mission.

  On her side are two Malboros,
  both capable of using Bad
  Breath, which induces Blind,
  Silence, and Poison status,
  Eerie Sound Wave, which
  neutralizes buffs, and Goo,
  which Immobilizes and lowers
  speed. They both have
  Immunity, granting them
  resistance to certain debuffs
  as well. The Great Malboro, on
  the other hand, can use
  Malboro Song to raise the
  attack and cast Regen on units
  in a small area, along with
  Putrid Breath, which inflicts
  Toad, Doom, and Confuse
  status. Between all the
  Malboros, go straight for the
  Great Malboro first because
  the prospect of getting Doomed
  or turned into a frog is far
  more hindering than the status
  ailments of Bad Breath.

  The Deadly Nightshade in this
  mission is a non-factor.
  Tomato Tackle, which lowers
  speed, and Tomato Ketchup,
  which inflicts Berserk, may
  pose a problem. Otherwise
  though, it isn't much of a
  threat at all. As for Florah
  herself, she has abilities
  that are determined by the
  weather and terrain. Depending
  on the weather, she can use
  one of two abilities. Shining
  Flare only works in the sun -
  it deals fire damage to a
  small area. Venom Squall
  conversely works only when
  it's raining. This ability is
  more of a nuisance because it
  can inflict Poison. Her last
  two abilities are Nature's
  Embrace, which deals moderate
  damage, and Life's Embrace,
  which deals damage and has a
  chance of Immobilize status.
  These two can only be used on
  natural terrain, which clearly
  applies to the entire
  battlefield.

  Your primary objective is
  Florah. When she is taken
  down, the mission will end.

         - Trickster x1
       - Elementalist x1
          - Parivir x1

  This battle is frustrating
  because of that ridiculous
  law. Ranged units are a
  necessity here even though the
  battlefield is small. The
  enemy clan is not affected by
  the law, so they are free to
  roam as they please.

  Target the Juggler first. His
  abilities include Dagger Toss,
  which damages with a chance of
  inflicting Disable, Weapon
  Toss, and Gil Toss. He can
  also use Smile Toss to put
  Quicken status on an ally.
  Once he is out of the way, the
  battle should go by much more
  easily. All the while, inflict
  Silence on the Elementalist,
  for she can cast Fire Whip,
  which has a chance of
  inflicting Disable, Shining
  Air, which can Blind, and
  Sliprain, which can inflict
  Slow. Her attack is pathetic,
  so she won't be an issue if
  you prevent her from casting
  her Elemental Magick.

  The Fusilier is capable of
  using Blindshot and
  Silenceshot. His Concentration
  P-Ability ups the accuracy.
  He's not a significant threat,
  but the debuffs can be quite
  annoying. As for the
  Trickster, be wary of his
  various abilities that can
  induce status ailments.
  Suggestion turns the target
  into a frog and Hypochondria
  inflicts Poison. Traumatize
  actually deals more damage to
  units afflicted with debuffs.
  Needless to say, the Trickster
  should be a high priority. His
  defense is not very high, so
  attack him with physical
  strikes.

  The Soldier is capable of
  using Rend Power, Rend Magick,
  and Rend MP to damage attack,
  magick power, and MP,
  respectively. He is otherwise
  not a significant threat, but
  his HP can make him tough to
  take down. For that reason,
  debuff him so that he cannot
  use his Soldier techniques. As
  long as his "Rend" abilities
  are disabled, he will cease to
  be a threat. Lastly, the
  Parivir is the primary damage
  dealer on the enemy team. His
  attack is very high, and he
  can use Wind Slash, a ranged
  wind-based attack, Hoarfrost
  Blade, which has a chance of
  inflicting Slow, and Iai Blow,
  which has a very low chance
 of inflicting an instant kill.

  The restriction of the law can
  make this battle tough. Do
  your best to use debuffs to
  your advantage. By Disabling a
  few of the units, you can
  avert your focus to others.
  Also, do not allow any of the
  enemy units to gang up on your
  characters. If they manage to
  back you into a wall, they may
  prevent you from moving. Since
  the law requires that you
  always MOVE one tile, the
  mission will be failed if the
  unit can't move because
  enemies are in the way.

       - Tonberry King x1

  You have four rounds to finish
  off these knife-wielding
  monsters. Units with high move
  stats are recommended here.

  Tonberrion are deadly
  creatures. Their Knife ability
  brings HP down to 10% and
  Butcher's Knife reduces HP to
  1. Karma is a deadly attack
  that deals damage determined
  by how many units the target
  has killed (has the potential
  to deal 999 HP damage at 100%
  accuracy). These Tonberrion
  often use Stalk to follow a
  specific target. Keep the
  stalked unit safe to prevent
  the Tonberrion from reaching
  him or her.

  These monsters have very low
  move stats, so you can outpace
  them to stay out of the range
  of their Knife and Butcher's
  Knife abilities. If you
  brought in ranged units, you
  can maintain your distance to
  stay safe. Keep in mind that
  each of the regular Tonberrion
  has Critical: Quicken set as
  an R-Ability, so make an
  effort not to put any of them
  in critical HP.

  Four rounds should be more
  than enough time to eliminate
  the four monsters here.
  Remember, the Tonberrion take
  half damage from all elements
  (except for the King Tonberry
  in this case because it is
  equipped with a Reaper's Robe,
  which absorbs dark).
  Therefore,
neutral attacks are recommended.

          - Sniper x1
         - Flintlock x1
         - Cannoneer x1

  The Gaitsnipe clan is a group
  of ranged units. The law
  forbids you from using ranged
  weapons, so you're at an
  immediate disadvantage
  already! Since you're dealing
  with enemies that can hit from
  afar, units with good move
  stats are recommended here to
  close the distance between you
  and the enemy. Also, abilities
  that can target enemies at a
  distance are allowed here as
  long as they don't require
 the use of any ranged weapons.

  Focus first on the Sniper. Her
  Death Sickle ability can
  inflict Doom status, and
  Doubleshot deals double the
  damage of a regular attack.
  Beso Toxico has a chance of
  inflicting Poison. Next,
  consider targeting the Hunter,
  who can use Vitals Shot to
  inflict a random debuff, in
  addition to Rend Power and
  Rend Magick. Like the Sniper,
  his weapon attack stat is
  fairly high, so take him down
  before he
 can fire off too many arrows.

  The Gunner is capable of
  inflicting Confuse, Blind, and
  Silence status with his
  various Gunmanship techniques.
  In addition, he can use Moogle
  Attack, a Moogle Knight
  ability. The Gunner's range is
  huge, but he isn't very fast,
  with a low move stat as well.
  You can easily back him into a
  corner and finish him off that
  way. Take caution around the
  Archer as well, who can use
  Leg Shot to inflict Immobilize
  status and Arm Shot to inflict
  Disable status.

  Both the Flintlock and
  Cannoneer aren't huge threats
  in this battle. The Flintlock
  is required to Prime his
  cannon before he can attack.
  He can heal his teammates with
  Cure Cannon and put Protect
  status on his allies through
  Protect Cannon. The Cannoneer,
  on the other hand, can dish
  out a lot of damage if you
  allow him to use Foresight,
  which increases the number of
  volleys in his next attack,
  and Buckshot, which makes it
  so that his next attack hits
  an area. Mortar is a powerful
  attack, but it prevents the
  Cannoneer from moving the next
  turn. I recommend that you
  leave these two units for
  last. If possible, put a
  restrictive debuff (Disable,
  Stop, Sleep, etc.) on them to
  prevent them from causing any
  trouble.

  You must recover all of the
  gemstones in order to complete
  the mission. Your enemies
  consist of a Hume and Moogle
  Thief, along with a
  Beastmaster and two Yellow
  Jellies. More will spawn as
  the battle carries on, so
  speed is of the essence here.

  Both the Hume Thief and the
  Beastmaster will be no threat
  in this mission. The Thief can
  use a number of steal
  commands, but unless you're
  looking to unleash a Scion (he
  has Steal Limelight), there's
  no need to bother with him.
  The Beastmaster can't really
  do anything in this mission
  since there's no monsters to
  take control of. Ignore him.

  The Moogle Thief is capable of
  using Juggler techniques.
  Molotov Cocktail inflicts fire
  damage with a chance of
  inducing Berserk. Dagger Toss
  can inflict Disable status. If
  there's any enemy to kill
  first, this Thief is it. It's
  best to take him down quickly
  so that he cannot go around
  and Disable/Berserk all of
  your units. Be sure to remove
  any status ailments that
  emerge.

  Lastly, the two Yellow Jellies
  can use Acid, which inflicts a
  random debuff, and cast
  Thundara. Protection against
  lightning can effectively
  negate their attack. Acid can
  prove to be annoying, but most
  of the debuffs that it can
  potentially inflict are easily
  be
 remedied by Esuna or Refresh.

  It's up to you whether or not
  to attack the enemies. The
  objective is only to collect
  the gemstones. Either way,
  it's strongly recommended that
  you eliminate the Moogle Thief
  early on. Finish the mission
  with haste, for more enemies
  of the Kthili Surveyors clan
  will appear as the battle
  carries on. These new spawns
  may or may not retain the same
  abilities as the starting
  enemies. It should also be
  noted that there are usually
  traps set near these
  gemstones. Step with caution.

        - Black Mage x1

  It's just typical that a
  battle against a clan
  specializing in ice has fire
  forbidden. Anyway, your
  objective is to defeat this
  clan of odd ice-based clan.
  Try to bring in units that are
  resistant to ice- based
  attacks.

  Needless to say, all of the
  units here specialize in ice-
  based attacks. The Gladiator
  is capable of using Blizzard
  Tackle and Ice Breath, and the
  Black Mage is able to cast
  Blizzard and Blizzara. The
  Parivir, in addition to
  Hoarfrost Blade, which can
  Slow the target (and deals ice
  damage, surprise surprise),
  can attack with Wind Slash, a
  ranged attack. He can also use
  Water Veil to inflict Silence
  status and Unspell, which
  dispels the target.

  The Scholar is a real pain,
  with his Rime Bolt Tome
  ability. This spell inflicts
  ice damage on every unit on
  the screen. He can also cast
  Water and Aero, which deal
  water-based damage and wind-
  based damage, in that order.
  The Summoner can cast Shiva,
  along with Elementalist
  abilities Shining Air, which
  deals wind damage and Blinds,
  and Sliprain, which deals
  water damage and Slows. Her
  Blood Price ability allows her
  to cast magick using her HP as
  MP. Lastly, the Illusionist
  can cast Freezeblink and
  Deluge. Both deal damage to
  every unit on your team. He
  also has Blood Price set as a
  P-Ability, meaning he doesn't
  need to wait in order to cast
  magick spells.

  Because there are so many
  spellcasters on the enemy
  team, try to Silence as many
  of them as you can to prevent
  them from casting spells. I
  would suggest that you go
  after the weakest units first.
  That would be the Black Mage
  and the Illusionist. Once they
  are down for the count, begin
  to focus on the other units.
  Prioritize the Parivir, whose
  Hoarfrost Blade can deal
  considerable damage. The
  Summoner should also be
  eliminated quickly. The rest
  of the mission is up to you,
  since none of the other units
  really are that threatening.
  Defeat all enemies to finish
  the mission.

  Enemies:

  Even though Ruuj is stacked
  1:6, this fight can still
  prove to be quite difficult.
  When this mission first
  appears, the level gap between
  your party and Ruuj (level 44)
  will render many of your
  attacks useless. Fight
  commands may do as little as 2
  HP damage! Be sure to have a
  unit with an Item command or
  ability to heal status
  ailments available. A White
  Mage is strongly recommended.

  At the very start, Ruuj will
  likely approach your party and
  cast a spell right off the
  bat. She likes to use Silence
  the most, so your spellcasters
  will suffer. Ruuj can also use
  a variety of Elemental Magick:
  Fire Whip deals fire damage
  with a chance of inflicting
  Disable, Boulder Crush deals
  earth damage with a chance of
  inflicting Immobilize, and
  Sliprain deals water damage
  with a chance of inflicting
  Slow. All of these debuffs can
  be annoying because Ruuj can
  easily prevent many of your
  units from even getting close
  to her. Her Doublecast allows
  her to use two spells in one
  turn, making her even more
  formidable. Use restorative
  items to return your affected
  units to normal health. Esuna
  and other similar abilities
  work as well. Be sure to heal
  when your units are in
  critical health!

  Because she's equipped with a
  Ribbon, you won't be able to
  weaken her through debuffs.
  Bring your strongest units up
  and surround her. Just trade
  blows until you've depleted
  her HP. Certain abilities work
  wonders in this battle,
  especially early in the game
  when they are readily
  available. If you're having
  trouble, Gil Toss (Juggler
  ability; learned through
  Jackknife) and Air Render
  (White Monk ability; learned
  through Kaiser Knuckles) are
  both effective abilities that
  can deal a good amount of

  Forbidden:
           - Using MP

  Enemies:
     - Bliu (Blue Mage) x1

  Although this mission shows up
  fairly early in the game, I do
  not suggest you attempt it
  until you actually have
  confidence in your party's
  ability. Bliu, at level 55,
  can be tough even with a full
  team available at your
  disposal. Combine that with
  the fact that using MP is
  forbidden and you have a very
  difficult fight on your hands.
  Of course, you can always
  ignore the law.

  The entire battlefield has
  traps scattered throughout. In
  a mission where you'll need
  all the HP you can maintain,
  it's strongly suggested that
  you use Libra to reveal them.

  You need strong non-magick
  units for this fight. The
  battlefield allows you to
  spread out your units. Take
  advantage of this and split
  your party into three groups
  of two. Bliu has a lot of HP,
  and his defense isn't shabby,
  so make sure your units are
  physically powerful enough to
  scratch him. Bliu has a very
  strong Blue Magick spell
  called Quake, which deals
  heavy earth damage to units in
  an area. Do your best to avoid
  grouping your units together
  to avoid taking excessive
  damage. His other Blue Magick
  spell, Expose Weakness, lowers
  defense and resistance. He
  will often use this debuff
  first before going on the
  offensive.

  Bliu also has the Seer
  ability, Magick Frenzy. This
  devastating attack dishes out
  both magick and physical
  damage and is all in all a
  huge pain. Be wary of his
  Counter R-Ability, which can
  have significant consequences
  considering the fact that he
  is dual
   wielding two Light Sabers.

  The bottom line is: do not
  attempt this mission until
  your units are at a level
  where they can hold their own
  against a level 55 Blue Mage.
  The prerequisite should be
  that they could at least
  survive ONE Magick Frenzy
  attack. Honestly though, this
  fight isn't tough when you're
  closer to Bliu's level.

  If you're intent on beating
  the Blue King early on, I find
  that the Ninja's Throw command
  is very useful. Toss a
  Zweihander at Bliu for a good
  50+ HP damage. With a team of
  Ninjas, you can easily
  overpower him by simply
  throwing weapons.

  Forbidden:
         - Restoring HP

  Enemies:
    - Verre (Green Mage) x1

  The third of the Five Kings is
  a tough one to take down. I do
  not recommend you attempt to
  do this mission until at least
  past level 30 unless you're
  prepared for a beating. The
  six units you bring in here
  should all be powerful with a
  wealth of abilities at their
  disposal. Try to bring in
  units with resistances to
  status ailments such as KO,
  Sleep, and Slow.

  Verre is a Green Mage, but
  only has one actual Green
  Magick ability. Tranq will up
  her accuracy to make her
  deadly Assassination
  techniques that much more
  dangerous. She will constantly
  use Last Breath to instantly
  kill her targets. Along with
  Last Breath, she can use
  Nightmare, which inflicts Doom
  and sleep, and Ague, which
  inflicts Slow. Out of all her
  abilities, Ague is the clearly
  the most forgiving. If you
  don't have any equipment that
  blocks KO and other status
  ailments, pray that she'll use
  Ague often.

  There is really not much
  strategy involved in this
  battle. Verre is not affected
  by most (if not all) status
  ailments, so there's no point
  trying to Disable or Silence
  her. However, you can damage
  her MP to hinder her ability
  to use Assassination
  techniques.

  Don't bother trying to cast
  offensive magick on Verre. Her
  Mirror Mail effectively
  reflects all magick back to
  the caster. The key to this
  battle is to swarm her quickly
  and beat her down before she
  can even fight back. For that
  reason, it's recommended that
  you wait until your level is
  closer to Verre's before
  attempting to take her down.
  Trust me, it will save a lot
  of frustration.

  x3, (Crown Scepter)

  Forbidden:
           - Debuffs

  Enemies:
    - Nware (Black Mage) x1

  In my opinion, the Black King
  is the easiest of them all.
  He's a Black Mage, meaning
  he'll deal primarily elemental
  damage. By equipping armor
  that is resistant to any one
  of these elements, you can
  easily make things much easier
  for your own party. Send in
  units that do not rely on
  fight commands only (Nware has
  Reflex). Ranged units (that
  can actually deal damage) are
  good here because they can
 outrange Nware's Black Magick.

  Since Nware requires one turn
  to gain enough MP to begin
  using his magick, you should
  take the opportunity to get
  closer. Nware is capable of
  casting Firaga, Thundaga, and
  Blizzaga. In addition, he can
  use the Animist ability,
  Toadsong, which inflicts Toad
  status. That can easily be
  remedied through a Maiden's
  Kiss, so the primary threat is
  his extremely powerful Black
  Magick. Cast Shell on your
  party to reduce damage, but be
  prepared to heal and revive
  should your units fall.

  Avoid grouping your units
  together. Also, DO NOT attempt
  to surround Nware. Since he
  absorbs fire, lightning, and
  ice, he can cast his Black
  Magick on himself to heal. If
  you have units surrounding
  him, all of them will be
  toasted/zapped/frozen.
  Patience is key here; you
  don't want to fight
  recklessly. If viable, use MP-
  damaging attacks to hinder his
  ability to use his spells.

  Another great strategy to use
  here would be to take
  advantage of the traps.
  However, this is only viable
  if you have the Libra clan
  privilege. By revealing all of
  the traps, you can attempt to
  lure Nware into the various
  traps. For some reason, he
  seems to be completely
  oblivious to their location.
  If you manage to lure him into
  one trap, that's over 200 HP
  damage right there. It's an
  excellent, albeit cheap, way
  to hurt him.

  Also, unlike the other Kings,
  the Black King is not
  resistant to all debuffs.
  Although the law expressly
  forbids them, you can ignore
  it without much consequence
  (unless you need to revive
  fallen units).

  Reward: 13720 Gil, Clock Gear
  x8, (Cheer Staff)

  Forbidden:
           - Missing

  Enemies:
    - Blanch (White Mage) x1

  Blanch is a White Mage, but
  don't let that fool you! He
  has a variety of deadly
  Sagacity techniques. He is
  also level 88, meaning if
  you're anywhere under level
  40, you're bound to have
  serious trouble with this
  heavy hitter. Bring in units
  with high HP for this battle.
  A healer is strongly
  recommended.

  Blanch is capable of healing
  himself constantly, which
  means this battle can turn
  into a long drawn-out war of
  attrition, assuming he doesn't
  just blast you away with
  Scathe first. In addition to
  Scathe, which deals
  excessively heavy damage, he
  can cast Bio for poison damage
  (with a chance of inflicting
  Poison) and Gigaflare, a
  devastating spell that affects
  units in an area. Shell can
  effectively negate some
  damage, but don't rely on it
  to save your party.

  Blanch has a very notable
  weakness in his P-Ability,
  Blood Price. This ability
  allows him to substitute HP
  for MP, meaning he can cast
  powerful spells nearly every
  turn. However, this is also
  his weakness. Since Sagacity
  skills take a load of MP to
  cast, his HP is going to go
  down pretty rapidly as a
  result. His MP Shield
  transfers some damage to MP,
  but that's negligible when you
  consider he only gains 10 MP a
  turn.

  There are multiple ways to
  defeat this mission, but a
  good strategy would be to
  inflict a debuff on Blanch.
  Though the law forbids
  missing, you can take your
  chances by inflicting Doom or
  Stop on him. In fact, he isn't
  even immune to Last Breath, so
  you can kill him instantly if
  you get lucky! If the law
  isn't important to you, then
  just chase him around
  attempting to debuff him as
  often as possible. Once you
  get lucky with Stop, you can
  essentially hit him with
  impunity. If you manage to
  land Doom on him, just sit
  back and wait. To expedite the
  process, cast Haste when he's
  Doomed. I don't think there's
  any explanation needed should
  Last Breath hit him.

  I don't usually mention traps,
  but note that the traps on
  this battlefield are capable
  of inflicting Charm.

  Enemies:
        - Cockatrice x4

  Because the Cockatrices "scare
  easily," you can only bring in
  four units. The key here is to
  protect the three Deadly
  Nightshades from the
  Cockatrices. There are four
  scattered around the map, and
  they are looking to make a
  meal of those tomatoes.

  The Cockatrices are fairly
  slow, so you have time to move
  your units into a position
  where they can better defend
  the Deadly Nightshades. The
  best way to go about doing
  this would be to plug up the
  paths leading to your side of
  the battlefield. Since the
  field is set up as a hollowed
  out square, you can easily do
  this.

  All of the Cockatrices can use
  Peck, which deals moderate
  damage. A few of them are
  capable of using Scurry as
  well, which casts Haste. This
  is a fairly easy battle, but
  be wary of your Deadly
  Nightshades. The tomatoes will
  attempt to fight themselves
  and can easily get themselves
  stuck in a sticky situation.
  Keep an eye on your Deadly
  Nightshades while clearing the
  map of Cockatrices. The
  mission will
   end when all are defeated.

  Send in six units for this

  the sparkling dots on the

  the sparklings dots are on the
  other side of the bridge,
  where a number of monsters are
  waiting for you.

  The monsters are not too tough
  to get through. The Axebeaks
  can use Peck, which deals
  damage over an area. It's not
  a very powerful attack, so
  don't worry about it too much.

  To quickly get through this
  mission, try to cross the
  bridges before the enemy
  monsters can block the path.
  Doing so will make the mission
  go much easier. If the
  monsters form a bottleneck at
  the bridge, then you'll have
  to remove the monster one way
  or another, which can get
  pretty painstaking.

  buddies. Take careful note of
  the objective - you must
  weaken Goud to critical health
  and eliminate all other
  monsters. DO NOT kill Goud or
  else you will fail the
  mission.

  Goud is accompanied by a
  Werewolf with a few irritating
  abilities. Roar removes buffs,
  En Garde puts the user in a
  counter status, and Assault
  deals damage and inflicts
  Immobilize. Among the other
  monsters, the Werewolf is the
  most dangerous, so eliminate
  it first.

  The Thunder Drakes are only
  fitted with Thunder Breath,
  which deals moderate damage.
  Be aware that the two can heal
  each other because both absorb
  lightning-based attacks. Take
  advantage of their weakness to
  water to quickly bring them
  down.

  Goug's only ability is Dragon
  Force, which buffs attack and
  magick. He will probably cast
  it on himself before going on
  the offensive. Other than
  that, he's really nothing to
  worry about. His attack stat

  You can check which of the

  at the name. Every other
  Cockatrice is to be

  are capable of using Peck, an
  attack that deals moderate

  Enemies:
      - Dreamhare (spawns)
     - Hoppy Bunny (spawns)

  Select six units for this
  fight. This is an Iron Stomach
  mission, meaning the objective
  is different from your typical
  engagement. If you have no
  idea what you're doing, this
  battle can go on forever
  because the monsters will keep
  spawning. Your objective is to
  take down exactly TWO
  Dreamhares, no more and no
  less.

  The other Hoppy Bunnies have
  no bearing on the mission
  itself. You can kill as many
  of them as you want. They'll
  often get in the way, so feel
  free to take them down at your
  leisure. All of the Hoppy
  Bunnies have the ability to
  use Hip Attack, along with a
  few Green Magick skills. A few
  of them may be able to use Go-
  Go Dance, which casts Haste.
  The Dreamhares, on the other
  hand, can use War Dance, which
  raises attack.

  Before you begin, be sure to
  open the treasure chest by
  your starting position. Then,
  work on hunting the
  Dreamhares. Once you have
  killed two Dreamhares, speak
  to the Bishop to end the
  mission. To do so, simply move
  a unit next to him and select
  the command. In the battle
  itself, do not worry about
  protecting the Bishop because
  he can't die. Also note that
  monsters will keep coming in
  as you kill their brethren, so
  you have an unending supply of
  enemies.

  Enemies:
       - Malboro (spawns)
  - Deadly Nightshade (spawns)
       - Alraune (spawns)

  This mission plays out like
  the first Foodstuffs mission.
  Your objective here to kill
  four Malboros. Bring in six
  units of your choosing for the
  battle. Units with abilities
  to heal status and status
  ailment resistance are
  recommended here.

  You should notice that at the
  start, there are not enough
  Malboros to satisfy the
  objective. In order to get
  more to spawn, you will have
  to eliminate the Deadly
  Nightshades and Alraunes to
  make room for more Malboros to
  spawn.

  All of the monsters are
  capable of inflicting status
  ailments on your party. The
  Alraunes can use Horn Venom to
  inflict Poison, in addition to
  their other attacks, Horn
  Blow, which knocks back, and
  Horn Shot, a ranged attack. Be
  wary of the Deadly Nightshades
  and their Tomato Ketchup,
  which can Berserk a unit.
  Their other abilities include
  Tomato Fang and Tomato Tackle.
  The latter ability also lowers
  speed.

  The Malboros boast their
  signature Bad Breath, a move
  that you want to avoid as best
  you can. It affects an area in
  front of the Malboro and can
  inflict Blind status, Poison
  status, and Silence status.
  Needless to say, you will want
  to do your best to avoid this
  attack. In the event that you
  are affected, be ready to
  cleanse the unit with Esuna or
  similar abilities. Also watch
  out for Goo, which inflicts
  Immobilize status and lowers
  speed.

  Since you have to keep
  fighting off the other
  monsters to cause more
  Malboros to appear, it's easy
  to lose track of exactly how
  many Malboros you've killed.
  Remember, in order to
  successfully complete the
  mission, you must take down
  exactly four Malboros, no less
  and no more.

  There are two treasures. Both
  are near the upper-right area
  of the battlefield. Pick them
  up if you'd like. When you are
  finished with
the mission, talk to the Bishop.

  Enemies:
    - Yellow Jelly (spawns)
  - Red Marshmallows (spawns)
      - Ice Flan (spawns)

  It's just typical that a fight
  against nothing but flans has
  a law that forbids their only
  weaknesses. Anyway, the
  description required something
  yellow and lustrous, meaning
  the Yellow Jellies are your
  targets here. You need to kill
  three Yellow Jellies to finish
  the mission. Killing more than
  three will fail the mission,
  so make sure you keep track.

  You are also up against Red
  Marshmallows and Ice Flans as
  well. There is no restriction
  on how many you choose to kill
  of these. You will have to
  eliminate a few of them to
  force more Yellow Jellies to
  spawn. The Red Marshmallows
  are capable of using Unction,
  which inflicts Oil status, and
  Merge, which sacrifices the
  user to heal the target back
  to full health. They can also
  cast Fira, which can be a
  problem if they managed to get
  Oil status on your units.

  The Ice Flans can use Merge as
  well, in addition to Acid,
  which inflicts a random
  debuff. The Ice Flans can cast
  Blizzara. Lastly, the Yellow
  Jellies (mission critical) can
  use Acid and Thundara. Some of
  the enemy monsters have Magick
  Up or Geomancy set as their
  P-Ability, so their spells
  will deal more damage to you.
  Deal with this by casting
  Shell on your units. Reflect
  status works too, but it's not
  recommended because the
  reflected magick will only
  heal the original caster.

  Once you've killed exactly
  three Yellow Jellies, speak to
  the Bishop
   at the bottom of the map.

          - Malboro x1
          - Ranger x2
         - Berserker x1

  Bring in six units for this
  battle. You are up against a
  few tough monsters here. The
  Yellow Jelly is capable of
  using Acid, which inflicts a
  random status ailment. It is
  lightning-based, so it's weak
  to Blizzard and other ice-
  based attacks. Unfortunately,
  the law forbids anything
  relating to ice, so you won't
  be able to take
   advantage of its weakness.

  The Grenade is relatively
  unthreatening. It will use
  Flame Attack, which deals
  moderate fire damage. Take
  caution around the Malboro
  though - it can use Bad
  Breath, which inflicts Blind
  status, Silence status, and
  Poison status on a target
  (usually not all at once
  though). It is fairly slow, so
  try to eliminate it before it
  can get too many turns in. Be
  prepared to cast Esuna should
  any of your
 units get hit with Bad Breath.

  Two of the Rangers can place
  Leech, which saps MP, and
  Silence Gas, which inflict
  Silence status, traps. These
  are only really an issue for
  your spellcasters. The
  Berserker leader is fitted
  with mostly buffs and debuffs.
  Overall, he's really not much
  of a threat because he rarely
  gets a chance to attack. You
  should focus first on the
  Rangers before going for the
  Berserker.

  You can tackle the enemies in
  any order. However, I'd
  recommend eliminating the
  Malboro and Yellow Jelly first
  because of their ability to
  inflict varying status
  ailments on your party. Then,
  dispatch the Rangers before
  finally killing off the
  Berserker and Grenade. Also,
  there are two treasures in the
  area: one at the upper-left
  corner and the other at the
  lower-right corner.

  Send in six units for this
  battle - preferably units that
  have resistance to Sleep,
  Charm, and Doom status. Back
  attacks are forbidden in this
  mission, meaning under NO
  circumstances can you
 attack an enemy from the rear.

  You are up against a few
  monsters in this battle. Your
  objective is to find the
  correct mushroom, but it's
  better to just eliminate all
  of the enemies first. The
  monster that is closest to
  your starting position is a
  Sprite, which you should work
  to quickly take down
 before it can cast Meteorite.

  Next, focus on the Lamia and
  Lilith. Leave the Dreamhare
  for last because it won't do
  too much. Be prepared, though,
  for it can cast Sleep. Out of
  the two remaining monsters,
  the Lilith is more dangerous
  because it can use Kiss, which
  inflicts Charm and Doom
  status, and Twister, which
  knocks off 50% of the target's
  HP. The Lamia, on the other
  hand, can use Night. This
  ability can put all units into
  a deep slumber. Neither of
  them are tough to kill though,
  so focus your attacks on them
  and finish them off quickly.

  There are two treasures on the
  battlefield you may want to
  gather before tasting the
  mushrooms. Only one of the
  mushrooms will be the correct
  one. Taste your way through
  until you find it.

  This is the final fight
  against Klesta, so send in
  your strongest units to join
  with Bowen. I really love the
  dialogue in this whole scene.

  Klesta has over 900 HP this
  time, so taking it down will
  take some time. The first
  turn, it will mostly like use
  Fortify to raise attack.
  Klesta boasts two powerful
  attacks, Devour, which damages
  units in a wide area, and
  Piston Drop, which deals
  damage to EVERYONE on-screen.
  Be prepared to heal whenever
  it uses Piston Drop because it
  can hurt quite a bit. Casting
  Protect on your clan and Clan
  Bowen can help to negate some
  of the damage.

  Unlike the previous missions,
  you can't just sit back and
  let Bowen do all the work.
  Have your physical units
  surround Klesta alongside
  Bowen and let the blades fly.
  Klesta has Absorb Damage, but
  at this point in the game, the
  HP it recovers is very minor.
  When you get it down to about
  half HP, Klesta will attempt
  to flee as it always does, but
  by using the Cloudy Sap,
  Klesta is forced back down.

  The remainder of the mission
  is exactly the same. Throw
  your most powerful attacks
  against Klesta. Eventually, it
  will fall. At long last, the
  beast is defeated. Stay tuned
  after the battle for a rather
  humorous scene (You, Tweigel!
  Your lips flap too loosely!).

  Your objective here is the big
  green thing, Ugohr. Bring in
  six units and deploy them. The
  monsters in this battle are
  fairly weak, with the
  exception of the mark, of
  course. You can choose to
  ignore the other monsters and
  go straight for Ugohr if
  you're in a rush. Just bear in
  mind that Ugohr is the
  mission's objective.

  The Cockatrices can use Peck,
  which deals moderate damage.
  Otherwise, they are not very
  dangerous at all, and they
  will only serve to get in the
  way. They also have Critical:
  Quicken as their R-Ability,
  which automatically gifts the
  Cockatrice the very next turn
  should it enter critical HP
  status. The Wolves can use
  Fang and nothing else. Like
  the Cockatrices, they too are
  not very threatening. Both the
  Cockatrices and Wolves are
  weak to water-based attacks,
  so use those (if applicable)
  to dispatch them quickly.

  Ugohr has got quite a few
  abilities at its disposal.
  Luckily for you, it's very
  slow, so if you are quick, you
  should be able to eliminate it
  before it can pose too much of
  a problem. Ugohr can use Rain
  of Stone, which deals earth
  damage to an area, and Sonic
  Spin, which damages
  surrounding units. Watch out
  especially for his Headbutt
  ability for it can inflict
  Immobilize status on its
  target. Ugohr's defense is
  quite high, and it's further
  augmented by his Defense Up
  P-Ability, so it may take a
  few turns before it falls.

  Ah, it's that Klesta again!
  You can only bring in three
  units for this battle. Make
  sure that they are under
  Klesta's level because the law
  forbids anyone from harming a
  unit that's a lower level than
  them.

  Don't worry about following
  House Bowen's orders - you can
  go straight for Klesta. You
  will have to climb up the hill
  in order to reach it. The big
  bird won't move, so you will
  have to do all of the walking.

  Klesta isn't easy to defeat,
  so let House Bowen take most
  of the blows. The main guy,
  Bowen, can't die. Klesta is
  fitted with a huge amount of
  HP - whittling it down will
  take a really long time. Just
  keep at it until it depletes.
  Be wary of his Territorial
  Marking, which deals moderate
  damage over an area. It's
  ranged, so Klesta can attack
  you with impunity while he is
  perched on top of the cliff.
  Devour is another strong
  ranged attack you should be
  wary of as well.

  Klesta's Absorb Damage
  R-Ability allows it to regain
  10% in HP of the amount of
  damage it takes. Even so,
  Klesta is not a very
  formidable opponent. With
  House Bowen's help, you should
  have little trouble.

  This mission requires you to
  activate all of the traps
  within the time limit of three
  rounds. There are many of
  them, so units with high speed
  and movement stats are
  mandatory here. Use the Move
  Up clan privilege if you have,
  and send in anyone with access
  to the
    Green Magick spell Leap.

  Unfortunately, you'll have to
  contend with the monsters as
  well. The focus of the battle,
  however, should remain on
  stepping over all of the
  traps. Yellow signifies
  Silence traps. Green signifies
  Leech traps (MP damage). Cyan
  signifies Sten Needle traps
  (HP damage), and Purple
  signify Love Potion traps. For
  the Charm traps, either use
  units with immunity to Charm
  or just attack the affected
  unit to get rid of the status.

  At the start of the mission,
  begin disarming all of the
  traps near your starting
  position. Let the enemies
  slowly make their way towards
  your party. This way, by the
  time they reach your position,
  they'd have cleared off of the
  traps on their side of the
  cavern. Then, quickly rush
  past the monsters to the other
  side. None of the monsters
  here are remarkably tough
  except for the Tonberry - it
  should be avoided at all
  costs! Getting hit with Knife
  or Butcher's Knife can be
  devastating (Knife reduces HP
  by 90%, Butcher's Knife
  reduces HP to 1).

  Disarm all the traps within
  the round limit to complete
  the mission. If you have every
  one of your units contributing
  to the process, then you
  should be able to finish well
  before the round limit is met.

  Thunder, and it is also fitted
  with Absorb Damage, which
  replenishes 10% of HP damage
  taken. Since a few of the
  monsters here are lightning-
  based, it will act as a healer
  by casting Thunder on its
  allies. For that reason, kill
  the Yellow Jelly as early as
  possible.

  Defeating Gilmunto is the
  objective, but he's pretty
  tough to defeat. Try to
  eliminate the other enemies
  first before going for him.
  All of the other monsters are
  weak to water, so use water-
  based attacks if possible. As
  for Gilmunto himself, be wary
  of Lightning and Thunder
  Breath. Both are very powerful
  lightning-based attacks.
  Gilmunto can also use Dragon
  Force, which raises attack and
  magick. He boasts a ton of HP,
  so you'll want to focus all of
  your attacks on him. If you
  have holy-based attacks
  available, by all means, use
  them!

  Note that there's a treasure
  chest at the lower-left corner
  of the battlefield.

 B2-08 It's a Trap! ~
 =----------------=
  While traveling through the
  Aldanna Range I mistakenly
  dropped several traps meant
  for sale. I'm afraid the shock
  of the drop has likely
  released their safety
  mechanisms, making them quite
  dangerous! Deactivating them
  would be hazardous at this
  point, so I just need someone
  to destroy them. It's the only
  way to be sure.

  The Baknamies are not to be

  having to deal with them at
  all. On the other hand, the
  Luchorpan is a bit tougher. It
  can use Mutilate, which saps
  damage to replenish its own
  HP. Magick Hammer deals MP
  damage.

  Go around and get rid of the
  Luchorpan first of all. Then,
  you can either choose to kill
  off the remaining Baknamies or
  start disarming the traps
  right away. Assuming you are
  at an adequate level, the
  Baknamies should pose no
  threat whatsoever. Disarm
  every single trap, picking up

  The Lang Bros. is an eccentric

  units. None of them are

  the fight and begin!

  You should focus first on the
  Fighter. With his Air Render
  ability, he poses the biggest
  threat to your party. His
  other abilities include Rush
  and Wild Swing, an attack that
  deals damage to all
  surrounding units. The Archer
  is annoying because he can
  Blind your units with
  Blackout. His other attack,
  Take Aim, is a weak, high-
  accuracy attack.

  As for the Thief, you don't
  have to worry too much about
  him. The only thing he will
  really do is walk around and
  steal your gil. Either leave
  him for last or deal with him
  swiftly. Lastly, the Black
  Mage is only capable of
  casting the three basic Black
  Magick spells. He isn't
  powerful, but try to avoid
  grouping your units together
  anyway to avoid taking extra
  damage.

  All of the enemies can use the
  Soldier technique, Provoke,

           - Bomb x3

  The party stumbles upon the
  Zedlei Forest absolutely
  teeming with Bombs and other
  monsters. Consider sending in
  units with ice-based abilities
  because the majority of
  monsters here are weak to that
  element. Equipment with
  resistance to fire would be
  helpful as well.

  Floating Eyes are the only
  neutral monsters on the field.
  Well, that's actually a lie
  because they are weak to earth
  and holy-based attacks. These
  monsters are capable of using
  Gnaw to inflict Poison status.
  Their other ability, Death
  Dive, is a suicidal
  desperation attack that kills
  the user and deals heavy
  damage to the target. The
  Floating Eyes typically use
  this attack when they are low
  on HP. To avoid getting hit by
  it, try to kill the Floating
  Eyes without
leaving them in critical health.

  The Bombs and the Red
  Marshmallow work hand in hand.
  All of them are fire-based, so
  expect to be hit constantly by
  Fire and Flame Attack. The Red
  Marshmallow has a skill called
  Unction which inflicts Oil
  status. This can be dangerous,
  considering the fact that most
  of the monsters here can hit
  you with fire-based attacks.
  For that reason, focus first
  on the Red Marshmallow before
  it can use Unction to coat
  your units with oil. Its
  defense is fairly high, so use
  spells to deal more damage to
  it. Blizzard/Blizzara/Blizzaga
  works very well against it.

  When focusing on the Bombs, be
  wary of their Self-destruct
  ability, which they use when
  they're in critical health.
  This ability deals heavy
  damage to all units
  surrounding the Bomb. To lower
  the chances of a Bomb using
  it, avoid putting it in
  critical health unless you're
  sure you can kill it before
  its next turn comes. One of
  the Bombs, however, has
  Critical: Quicken, which will
  automatically give it the next
  turn if its health gets too
  low. Should this happen, you
  can count on it to use Self-
  destruct the next turn. To
  avoid this, either kill the
  Bomb without putting it in
  critical health status with a
  powerful attack or fight it
  from a distance.

      - Actions by Nu Mou

  Enemies:
       - Antlion (spawns)
      - Pit Beast (spawns)
   - Flowsand Lord (Yowie) x1

  Depending on your characters'
  levels, this battle may range
  from excruciatingly difficult
  to only mild challenging. If
  your units are at least level
  25, I'd say you should be able
  to finish the mission
  comfortably. You will want to
  bring a healer. Units capable
  of casting Protect and buffing
  defenses are strongly
  recommended here as well.

  The Lord of the Flowsand is
  essentially a huge mouth in
  the ground. It's situated at
  the very lowest point in the
  cavern, so you'll have a lot
  of walking to do in order to
  reach it. In addition, you
  will have to contend with a
  few Antlions and Pit Beasts
  that will constantly spawn.
  The Antlions can use a variety
  of attacks, including Bile,
  which lowers resilience, and
  Mucus, which inflicts Slow.
  The Pit Beasts, on the other
  hand, can only use Sandstorm,
  which damages an area and
  inflicts Blind.

  The Flowsand Lord will prove
  to be hard to take down,
  primarily due to his
  excessively high HP. His
  abilities include Gravity
  Flux, an attack that hits all
  units on the screen for
  moderate damage. Out of all
  his abilities, this one is the
  least dangerous. Stun Crush is
  an attack that damages
  surrounding units and
  Immobilizes them. This can put
  you in a bad spot because
  it'll Immobilize you while
  your units are still
  surrounding it, giving it more
  chances to Stun Crush
  repeatedly. Lastly, Draw In is
  a ranged attack that picks up
  a unit and moves it next to
  the Flowsand Lord while
  dealing moderate damage. This
  can be an issue for ranged
  units, but it can be avoided
  by staying out of the attack's
  range. Note that the Flowsand
  Lord is weak to wind-based
  attacks - take advantage of
  that.

  There are numerous strategies
  you can use for this mission.
  First of all, ignore the
  Antlions and Pit Beasts -
  instead, focus all of your
  units on the Flowsand Lord. If
  possible, inflict Disable on
  or Stop the other monsters to
  prevent them from causing too
  much trouble.

  The first method would be to
  gather up all of your
  strongest physical units and
  surround the Flowsand Lord
  with them. Then, move any
  healers and buffers behind
  them, casting Protect and
  raising defenses as they go.
  It would help if your physical
  units had Counter as an
  R-Ability to deal extra
  damage. In this situation, the
  Flowsand Lord will probably
  mostly make use of Stun Crush
  to damage surrounding units.
  It's a fairly powerful attack,
  so make sure your healers are
  doing their job.

  Alternatively, you can send in
  a team of ranged units with
  ranges OVER six tiles. The
  Flowsand Lord's Draw In
  ability has a maximum range of
  six tiles. If you position
  your units in such a way as to
  stay out of his range, you can
  fire at it with impunity, only
  having to worry about Antlions
  and Pit Beasts. This is a
  viable strategy, but it only
  works if your units have the
  adequate range.

          - Fencer x1
           - Thief x1

  There's something about these
  games that seem... kinda
  shady. Send in a team of six
  units for this battle. You are
  up against a generic clan of
  six units.

  The White Monk is capable of
  using Roundhouse, which
  damages surrounding units, and
  Air Render, which inflicts
  ranged damage. The Soldier can
  use Rend Speed and Mug Gil,
  and the Thief can use Steal
  Items and Steal Gil. The last
  physical unit, the Fencer, is
  a bit more dangerous than the
  others with her Swarmstrike
  ability, which has a chance of
  inflicting Poison. Featherblow
  deals light damage and
  Piercing Blow deals damage two
  tiles out.

  As for the spellcasters, be
  wary of the Black Mage, who
  can cast the three basic Black
  Magick spells in addition to
  Blizzara. If you Silence him,
  he'll be rendered useless.
  Lastly, the White Mage can
  cast Cure and Esuna, which
  dispels some debuffs. Unless
  you can effectively Silence
  both of them, it's best to
  focus on these mages first.

  Note that the law MUST be
  upheld in order to complete
  the mission. Not moving is
  illegal, meaning you have to
  move at least one tile every
  turn. It seems easy enough,
  but you may get stuck if the
  enemy happens to surround one
  of your units. The battlefield
  is small, so you will have to
  take cautious steps, making
  sure the enemy cannot mob any
  of your characters. Try not to
  back any of your units up
  against the edges or corners
  to avoid getting stuck.

  Here, you are to defend
  Syrenead from getting herself
  hurt. The only monster is an
  Ivory Wyrm, who is level
  23-25. Note the law. If you
  are under its level, you
  cannot attack the Ivory Wyrm
  without breaking the law. Send
  in units accordingly and begin
  the battle.

  You must protect Syrenead in
  order to finish the mission.
  The Nagaraja has a lot of HP
  and it attack stat is very
  high, so you will have to
  approach it cautiously. It can
  use Ice Orb and Ice Breath,
  both ice-based attacks that
  don't have any debuffs
  attached to them luckily.
  However, it can use the
  Wyrmcraft ability Sleet, which
  inflicts Doom and Sleep.
  Equipment resistant to Doom
  would help here.

  The Nagaraja is weak to holy-
  based attacks, so take
  advantage of that. Paladins
  are very effective here
  because they can both Cover
  Syrenead and inflict holy
  damage through Holy Blade or
  Saint Cross. Syrenead is
  actually helpful in this
  battle - she can cast Leap to

  Out in the snowfields, you
  will encounter the Mamatrice.
  Perhaps the "lost" child was
  actually Klesta? Whatever the
  case, the Mamatrice is pretty
  angry. Send in six units for
  this battle and begin.

  The Mamatrice is incapable of
  moving or changing her facing.
  Only one of her attacks, Peck,
  actually requires a unit to be
  next to her though. Devour
  (hits a huge area) and
  Territorial Marking (hits an
  area) can both hit units at a
  distance. Both attacks deal
  heavy damage, so be prepared
  to heal if necessary. Note
  that the Mamatrice is weak to
  earth and wind-based attacks.

  A great strategy to use here
  would be to have all of your
  units with Counter set as a
  Reaction Ability stand next to
  the Mamatrice. Since she can't
  move, those units will always
  counter whenever they are
  damaged.

  Unfortunately, the law is
  pretty restricting,
  considering the fact that the
  Mamatrice has over 800 HP!
  It's up to you whether or not
  to follow it. The battle will
  obviously go much more quickly
  if you just break it. When
  you've reduced the bird's HP,
  she will fly away.

  The Ivory Wyrm is in the range
  of level 32-34, meaning you
  need to use units that are
  under or at its level to avoid
  breaking the law. If that's
  not possible, then just go
  through with breaking the law
  - the punishment isn't very
  severe. Since the map itself
  is very tough to traverse,
  send in units with high jump
  and move stats. Grias work
  well here because their
  movement ignores height. Any
  unit equipped with Galmia
  Shoes or Faerie Shoes should
  too be sent in.

  Syrenead must be protected in
  this battle, so make sure she
  is always out of harm's way.
  Cast Protect and Shell on her.
  If possible, put Reraise
  status on her as well.
  Paladins can use Cover to take
  the damage for her. Her
  abilities are not too bad. She
  can help you out significantly
  by casting Leap on your party,
  which improves movement.
  Blind, unfortunately, won't be
  too useful here. Also, her
  Regeneration R-Ability will
  help her stay alive.

  As for the Ivory Wyrm itself,
  expect to be hit with Ice Orb
  and Ice Breath, both ice-based
  attacks obviously. Ice Orb
  deals higher damage, but it
  can't damage in a cone area
  like Ice Breath. The Ivory
  Wyrm's most dangerous attack,
  however, is its Sleet ability,
  which can Dooms and inflicts
  Sleep on the target.

  The Ivory Wyrm is weak to
  holy-based attacks. It also
  takes half damage from fire,
  ice, and lightning. Don't use
  dark-based attacks because it
  will just absorb those. In
  order to successfully finish
  the mission, you MUST put the
  Ivory Wyrm in critical HP
  status. If you accidentally
  kill it, the mission will end
  in a failure.

          - Soldier x1

  This is your first encounter
  with the Duelhorn group, a
  team that will be sure to
  cause more trouble in the
  future. Count on that! This
  battle, anyway, is not
  remarkably difficult. Send in
  six units, preferably with
  someone who can heal status
  ailments, and start the fight.

  The enemy Soldier is capable
  of using Provoke to inflict
  Berserk status. In addition,
  he bears some Paladin skills
  as well, including Cover,
  which allows him to protect
  another unit, and War Cry,
  which raises the resilience of
  surrounding units. He is
  wielding a strong sword, so
  try to avoid activating his
  Counter with any of your
  weaker units or else you may
  take more damage than you'd
  like. The Bangaa Warrior can
  use Rend Power and Rend Magick
  to lower attack and magick
  power, respectively. He is
  also capable of inflicting
  Berserk through the Trickster
  ability Snigger. It should
  also be noted that his Blood
  Sword allows him to drain HP
  from his targets, but his
  attack is so low (even with
  Doublehand) that it won't make
  a difference.

  Both Archers are capable of
  using Blackout to inflict
  Blind status. The Viera also
  has Fencing skills
  Swarmstrike, which can inflict
  Poison, and Shadowstick, which
  can lower speed. The Hume
  Archer, on the other hand, can
  use Rend Power and Rend
  Magick. Lastly, the Black Mage
  can cast Blizzard and
  Blizzara, which both deal
  moderate ice damage. To avoid
  taking heavy damage, avoid
  grouping your units together.

  Be wary of the Animist, who
  can use Sheep Count to put a
  group of units to sleep. He's
  annoying in this battle
  primarily for Cuisine, which
  replenishes HP by 100%!
  Needless to say, the Moogle
  needs to go first. Do your
  best to debuff the other more
  dangerous enemies with
  Disable, Stop, Silence (for
  the Black Mage) while you
  focus your attacks on the
  Animist. When the Animist
  down, you can freely move on
  to the rest of the party,
  taking them down any way you'd
  like.

  The Duelhorn group is causing
  trouble yet again. It seems
  like there is a much bigger
  scheme here than originally
  expected. Of course, leave it
  to Luso to just dive into
  battle without a second
  thought. It should be noted
  that the enemies here have
  various resistances to certain
  elements. Be sure to check
  first.

  The Duelhorn Fencer can use
  Featherblow and Piercing Blow,
  which deals damage two tiles
  out. In addition, she can also
  use the Precision ability
  Cupid to inflict Charm status.
  Avoid that the best you can.
  Should any of your units get
  Charmed, attack the affected
  unit to knock it off. The
  Moogle Thief is capable of
  using Moogle Attack and Moogle
  Lance, a ranged attack. Most
  of the time though, he'll just
  be running around stealing
  gil, so he is not much of a
  threat here.

  As for the Hunter, be wary of
  Vitals Shot, which inflicts a
  random status ailment. She can
  also use Full Assault, a very
  strong attack that ends up
  leaving her in Sleep status,
  and Sneak Attack, a move that
  deals varying damage depending
  on the target's facing. If
  Sneak Attack hits a target
  from behind, it inflicts a ton
  of damage. Do your best to
  avoid leaving your back open.

  The Warrior has only one
  ability that may be
  problematic - Lifetap reduces
  a target's HP by 50%, which
  can hurt your high-HP units
  quite a bit. In addition, he
  can also use Body Slam, which
  deals moderate damage, and
  Bangaa Cry, which has a chance
  of inflicting Confuse status
  in an area similar to Dragoon
  "Breath" attacks (a cone in
  front of the user). Since he
  has a ton of HP, consider
  putting Disable, Stop, or
  Sleep on him so you can leave
  him for last.

  Prioritize the Time Mage
  because he will constantly use
  Haste. He also has the Water
  and Aero spells, which deal
  moderate damage: they can be
  issues for any units that have
  weaknesses to water and wind.
  Finally, the White Mage is the
  primary healer - he is able to
  cast Cura and Esuna, along
  with the Blue Magick technique
  Magick Hammer. Focus your
  attacks on the White Mage as
  well to prevent the Duelhorn
 group from healing themselves.

  Ah, looks like Duelhorn is up
  to no good here. The four here
  are the Four Bosses of
  Duelhorn, an organization with
  the sole intention of full
  domination of Jylland! Send in
  six units for the battle,
  making sure that you heed
  attention to the law (the
  Summoner is female, the rest
  are males).

  Maquis (Ninja) can use Earth
  Veil, which inflicts earth
  damage and Slow status, and
  Oblivion, which inflicts Addle
  status. He can also cast
  Magick Frenzy for heavy
  damage. Alys the Ensorceled
  (Summoner) is capable of
  casting a variety of Summoning
  Magick, including Shiva,
  Kirin, and Maduin. Shiva and
  Maduin deal ice and holy-based
  damage respectively, whereas
  Kirin grants Regen status to
  allies in a group. The Night
  Dancer (Trickster) can use
  Charisma, which inflicts Charm
  status, and Traumatize, which
  deals greater damage to
  targets afflicted with
  debuffs. Lastly, Duke
  Snakeheart (Arcanist) can cast
  Death, in addition to Sagacity
  techniques Scathe and
  Gigaflare, both of which deal
  extremely heavy damage.

  The objective says to defeat
  all foes, but you actually
  have to eliminate only one of
  the bosses. For that reason,
  you should focus on the enemy
  closest to you, whoever that
  may be. More often than not,
  it will be Maquis because his
  speed and move stats far
  exceeds those of his allies.
  When facing Maquis though, be
  wary of his Blink Counter
  R-Ability, which can easily be
  avoided by using ranged
  attacks against him. Should
  you attempt to take down any
  of the others, note that Alys
  the Ensorceled has Magick
  Counter and the Night Dancer
  has MP Shield.

  Even though the Four Bosses is
  a pretty dangerous group, you
  should have little trouble
  just focusing your strongest
  attacks on a single unit. As
  soon as the first is fallen, a
  Soldier will rush in with bad
  news for the Duelhorn leaders.
  With that, they'll leave the
  fight.

 B3-16 Knowing the Beast ~
 =---------------------=
  Never become attached. The
  rules on this are clear. But
  it is not so easy to leave one
  who has fought so long at your
  side. A dreamhare I had
  ensorceled lamed its leg and
  lies wounded in the mountains
  near Camoa. Will you help me
  rescue the poor creature?

  Bring in six units for this
  battle. The objective here is
  to prevent the enemy beasts
  from reaching your side of the
  bridge (the right side) for
  four whole rounds.

  Luckily for you, the bridges
  are only a tile thick.
  Position a strong unit at the
  left edge of each bridge to
  plug up the path, for the
  enemy won't be able to cross
  with a unit in the way. Any
  ranged characters can support
  the blockade by attacking from
  behind. Don't worry if the
  Wolves and Baknamies manage to
  step on to the bridge. As long
  as they don't cross it, you'll
  be fine.

  Avoid crossing over to the
  enemy's side even if you have
  managed to push the monsters
  away because more monsters
  will continue to come in. It's
  best to keep your units on the
  bridge just in case an enemy
  happens to slip by. Note that
  monsters will keep coming in
  as you kill them, so don't
  expect to be able to eliminate
  all of the monsters.

  Completing this mission will

  You will meet the Night Dancer
  here, the androgynous Bangaa
  Trickster. Accompanying him
  are various other Bangaa units
  that are not remarkably
  dangerous. Send in six units
  to combat the Duelhorn clan.

  The Three White Monks are
  blocking the bridges, so you
  will want to take care of them
  first. They all have exactly
  the same skill sets, with
  White Monk ability Earth
  Render, which deals damage in
  a straight line. Additionally,
  they can use Snigger to induce
  Berserk status and
  Hypochondria to inflict
  Poison. Keep spellcasters away
  to prevent the White Monks
  from Berserking them.

  Target the Templar next, for
  he can cast Haste, Cura, and
  Dispel. His attack stat is
  fairly high as well. Keep in
  mind that he has a Cachusha
  equipped, meaning you won't be
  able to land most status
  ailments on him. The Gladiator
  is a very strong damage-
  dealer. He has two Dragoon
  abilities in addition to his
  Fire Soul attack, which deals
  fire-based damage obviously.
  Lancet saps HP from the
  target, and Bangaa Cry deals
  damage in a cone-shaped area
  with a chance of confusing the
  targets. Like the Templar, the
  Gladiator is also
   equipped with a Cachusha.

  The Night Dancer can use
  Charisma, which induces Charm
  status. His other ability,
  Traumatize, deals more damage
  to units with more debuffs. He
  also can use Lancet to sap HP.
  Keep in mind that the Night
  Dancer is equipped with a
  Ribbon, so status ailments
  will not work in this case.
  Just focus your attacks on him
  until he falls. Once he's
  down, the mission will end.

  Enemies:
         - Fusilier x6

  This mission can make your
  want to pull your hair out.
  All of the Fusiliers are able
  to attack you from a distance,
  with a few capable of
  inflicting varying status
  ailments on your party. Couple
  that with the fact that one of
  them is in an extremely hard
  to reach spot, and you have
  quite an annoying mission on
  your hands. I'd suggest
  bringing in units with
  resistances to debuffs. You
  need at least ONE ranged unit
  for this battle.

  Let's see, where should I
  begin? The Fusilier that
  talked can use Confushot and
  Charmshot to inflict Confuse
  and Charm status.
  Unfortunately, his Barette
  (Moogles can wear Barettes
  now?) blocks many status
  ailments from affecting him. I
  strongly recommend you go
  after this Fusilier first
  before taking on the others.

  The Fusilier standing near
  him, on the stump, can only
  use Silenshot. This will only
  be a problem for your
  spellcasters, but other than
  that, he's a low priority. As
  for the three Fusiliers along
  the right side of the
  battlefield, the two to the
  upper-right can use Iceshot
  and Fireshot, respectively.
  The other one to the lower-
  right can use Boltshot. I
  doubt elemental weaknesses
  apply significantly to your
  team, so leave these three for
  last.

  Lastly, the one standing WAY
  on top of the ledge can use
  Blindshot. Prioritize this
  fellow with your spellcasters
  and ranged units. Melee units
  must climb up along the right
  side of the map to reach him,
  which can take way too much
  time.

  Once you defeat this group of
  Fusiliers, you will attain
  access to
 the Fusilier job for Moogles.

  The Eastwatch clan consists of
  Ninjas, Assassins, and
  Parivirs. Send in six units
  for this battle against the
  warriors from the East.

  The enemy Assassin is the
  quickest unit on the team, so
  keep an eye on her. Her
  abilities are particularly
  malicious. They include
  Shadowbind, which inflicts
  Stop status, Aphonia, which
  inflicts Silence, and Ague,
  which inflicts Slow. However,
  she can easily be disabled by
  Silencing her or inflicting
  some other debuff that
  prevents her from using her
  abilities. Her attack isn't
  very powerful, rather it is
  just her Assassination
  techniques that are any
  threat.

  One Ninja can only use Throw,
  whereas the other Ninja can
  cast Fire Veil, which deals
  fire damage with a chance of
  Confuse status, Gold Veil,
  which deals neutral damage
  with a chance of Blind status,
  and Water Veil, which deals
  water damage with a chance of
  Silence status. This Ninja can
  be prevented from casting his
  "Veils" by Silencing him. As
  for the other Ninja, you
  really only have to watch out
  for Throw, which has the
  potential to deal heavy damage
  depending on what he chooses
  to toss. He is capable of
  using Items as well.

  Lastly, the three Parivirs all
  can use Iai Blow, which rarely
  delivers instant death. The
  Parivir in the back also can
  use Wind Slash, which deals
  wind damage. The one second
  from the rear can attack with
  Shimmering Blade, which deals
  fire damage and can
  potentially induce Confuse
  status. Lastly, the final
  Parivir can use Blade Bash,
  which has a chance of
  inflicting Immobilize status.

  This is not a very tough
  battle. Some of the enemy
  units (especially the Ninjas)
  have fairly high evade
  statistics, so you may have
  trouble hitting them. If
  possible, inflict Stop, Sleep,
  or similar status ailments on
  them to effectively prevent
  them from being able to evade
  your attacks.

  Once you've defeated the
  opposition, the Parivir job
  for Humes will be unlocked.

  Alchemists. Either of those
  three will work. Wait ten days

 B4-12 To Be a Spellblade ~

  Enemies:
          - Fencer x1
         - Assassin x1
        - Green Mage x1
    - Various Viera (spawns)

  Your objective here is to
  protect Hana while taking down
  the various Viera units that
  oppose her. Although there are
  only three enemy Viera on the
  battlefield at the start, more
  will spawn. You need to defeat
  ten in all. A White Mage (or
  any other healing unit) is
  strongly recommended here in
  order to keep Hana alive.

  You are up against a number of
  Viera. None of them have any
  secondary Action Ability sets,
  Reaction Abilities, or Passive
  Abilities, so they aren't
  remarkably challenging. Hana,
  the Red Mage, is actually
  quite well-versed in the
  skills of the Red Mage - she
  can use Doublecast. Her spells
  include Fire, Thunder,
  Blizzard, and Cure. In
  addition, she can attack with
  Fencer skills Swarmstrike and
  Piercing Blow. Her Magick Up
  P-Ability really boosts her
  magick damage, making her a
  fairly strong offensive unit.

  None of the enemy units will
  really prove to be difficult
  to defeat. However, most of
  them have high speed stats,
  far exceeding Hana's speed
  stat. For that reason, you
  will need to keep Hana
  protected. Consider casting
  Shell and Protect on her. If
  you have a Paladin available,
  Cover works well. Your healing
  unit should be ready to
  replenish HP whenever
  necessary. Consider putting
  Reraise status on
    Hana for extra security.

  Among all of the Viera you'll
  face in this mission, you
  should be especially careful
  of the Assassins, who are
  capable of using Ague (Slow
  status) and Aphonia (Silence
  status). The final unit to
  enter will be a Spellblade.
  She can use Poison Blade,
  Sleep Blade, and Confusion
  Blade. These abilities are all
  capable of inflicting status
  ailments as their names
  suggest. In addition, her
  Blood Price P-Ability allows
  her to bypass any MP costs by
  using HP instead. Overall
  though, she isn't very strong.
  Take her down to finish the
  mission.

  With the defeat of the
  Spellblade, the Spellblade job
  for the Viera will become
  available.

  mop up what's left. Ten days
  should be enough to finish the

  Forbidden:
           - Copycat

  Enemies:
       - Ahriman (spawns)
    - Floating Eye (spawns)

  The monsters you will
  encounter in this mission are
  Floating Eyes and Ahrimans.
  The objective is to kill
  exactly four Floating Eyes, so
  Ahrimans are not critical to
  the mission. Even so, you will
  probably be required to kill a
  few Ahrimans to force more
  Floating Eyes to spawn.

  Your primary focus, again, are
  the Floating Eyes. These
  monsters are frail, but they
  have fairly high evade and
  speed stats. Floating Eyes can
  use two abilities that can
  inflict status ailments.
  Supersonic Wave can induce
  Silence and Gnaw can inflict
  Poison status. Apart from
  that, the Floating Eyes are
  almost no threat at all.

  On the other hand, the
  Ahrimans, the bigger eyeballs
  that are not critical to the
  mission, are much more
  formidable. Their abilities in
  this mission include Glare,
  which turns the target to
  Stone. In addition, be careful
  of Demonic Gaze, which can
  Confuse, and Bewitching
  Glance, which Charms and
  Slows. A common strategy to
  use against these Ahrimans
  would be to prevent them from
  making eye contact with your
  units. If an Ahriman attempts
  to use any of its Enthrallment
  abilities on a unit that IS
  NOT facing the Ahriman, then
  the ability has success rate
  0%. Unfortunately, turning
  their backs allows the
  Ahrimans to get in for a back
  attack, but it's a worthy
  sacrifice if you're not
  looking to get Charmed or
  petrified.

  You need to kill exactly four
  Floating Eyes. If you kill any
  more or any less, the mission
  will be a failure. Should you
  run out of Floating Eyes to
  kill, eliminate some Ahrimans
  to make room for more Floating
  Eyes to spawn. When you are
  ready, speak to the Bishop at
  the corner, and tell him that
  you have attained the
  requested ingredients.

        - Targeting Self

  Enemies:
         - Rafflesia x1

  This is a speed battle against
  House Bowen. The target is a
  huge plant called a Rafflesia.
  It actually has so much HP
  that it shows up as ???. It
  has a little over 1000 HP,
  which means you will have to
  reduce it to under 1000 HP in
  order for the actual HP value
  to replace the ???.

  Ranged units are best here
  because it's necessary to
  maintain your distance.
  Rafflesia is capable of using
  Nectar Volley, which can
  inflict Poison and Silence,
  Vine Lash, which inflicts Slow
  and delays the targets' next
  turns, and Blinding Cloud,
  which inflicts Blind.
  Soporific Cloud puts units to
  sleep, and Bewildering Cloud
  inflicts Confuse status. The
  "Cloud" abilities only affect
  units surrounding the
  Rafflesia, meaning ranged
  characters should not be
  affected if they are far
  enough away.

  The Rafflesia is weak to fire-
  based attacks. Use Firaga and
  other fire-based spells to
  deal heavy damage. Hunters
  with Sidewinder are also very
  effective here. Remember, the
  victor is the party that deals
  the killing blow to the
  Rafflesia. You can use some
  cheap strategies here to
  guarantee your win, such as
  inflicting Stop or Disable on
  Bowen's clan to prevent them
  from attacking. Beat House
  Bowen in this challenge to
  complete the mission.

       - Chocobo (spawns)
       - Alraune (spawns)
  - Various Monsters (spawns)

  Send in six strong units for
  this battle. It is not an easy
  fight, so consider sending in
  a White Mage or any other unit
  for curative purposes. Esuna
  or other status-healing
  abilities are very useful
  here.

  The objective here is to
  defeat ten monsters. They will
  spawn nearly every turn, so
  you will need to swiftly take
  down the monsters before they
  can overwhelm you. Monsters
  seemingly rush in at random,
  so there is no set pattern as
  to what monsters may appear.

  Many of the monsters are
  fitted with malicious
  abilities that allow them to
  serious hinder your party. The
  Lamias can all use Night to
  put all units to sleep (even
  enemy monsters). Twister is an
  area attack that knocks off
  50% of a unit's remaining HP.
  Prioritize
   these dangerous creatures.

  Antlions and Pit Beasts both
  have a variety of abilities
  you should avoid. Antlions are
  capable of using Bile, which
  lowers defense and resilience,
  Mucus, which inflicts Slow
  status, and Saliva, which
  lowers speed. Pit Beasts, on
  the other hand, can use
  Sandstorm, which can inflict
  Blind on a group of units.
  Subsidence deals earth damage
  but does not otherwise have
  any adverse effects.

  Malboros are just overall
  nuisances due to their Bad
  Breath ability, which inflicts
  Blind, Silence, and Poison.
  Also watch out for Goo, which
  can lower speed. They can use
  Eerie Sound Wave to neutralize
  buffs as well. The Hoppy
  Bunnies are the primary
  buffers of the monsters. Go-Go
  Dance casts Haste on a group
  of units and War Dance raises
  the attack of a group of
  units.

  Needless to say, any unit with
  status-healing abilities would
  be extremely useful in this
  battle. Cleanse any negative
  status ailments to prevent
  them from hindering your team
  too much. At the same time,
  it's recommended that you use
  debuffs on the monsters to
  give you a bit more breathing
  room. Monsters will spawn very
  quickly, making it very easy
  to get overwhelmed in this
  battle. By inflicting Disable
  or putting monsters to sleep,
  you can easily prevent some of
  the monsters from posing a
  threat temporarily.

  Also, try to keep your units
  in the same vicinity. If you
  scatter them, you're only
  providing the enemy an
  opportunity to swarm that one
  unit. By grouping your units
  together, you can effectively
  focus all of your attacks on
  one monster at a time. Keep in
  mind, however, that grouping
  your units TOO closely can
  leave you susceptible to area
  attacks such as Sandstorm and
  Bad Breath. Keep units in the
  same vicinity, but maintain
  some semblance of distance.

  I am aware that other monsters
  can possibly come in. I've
  only detailed what I believe
  to be the most dangerous
  monsters that can appear.
  Anyway, finish off ten
  monsters to complete the
  mission.

  Before you begin the fight,
  scan the field and check the
  monsters' levels. The law
  expressly forbids you from
  attacking enemies at a lower
  level than you. Bring out your
  units accordingly.

  You have four rounds to go to
  all six orchard trees and
  gather fruit from them. Of
  course, there are monsters
  here to get in the way. Do not
  attempt to kill them all, for
  more monsters will simply
  spawn to take their places.
  Although you should ignore the
  Baknamies and Werewolves, be
  wary of Bloody Orbs and
  Ahrimans, which are capable of
  inflicting a variety of status
  ailments.

  The Ahrimans, in particular,
  are the biggest nuisance
  primarily due to their
  Roulette ability. When it is
  used, a random unit on the
  field will be selected and
  KOed instantly. If you get
  lucky, it'll kill one of the
  enemy monsters. Their other
  abilities are quite
  unforgiving as well. Glare
  inflicts Stone status, Demonic
  Gaze inflicts Confuse status,
  and Bewitching Glance inflicts
  Charm and Slow status.

  Be on the lookout for incoming
  monsters. Lamias and Liliths
  may show up, and we should all
  know how much trouble they can
  cause. The Liliths in this
  mission can use Eternal Sleep,
  a move that Dooms and puts ALL
  targets to sleep. This should
  be ample reason to target any
 Liliths that show themselves.

  Depending on how much you
  gather, the prize will differ.
  The more you collect, the
  better the prize.

  The potions are scattered all
  over the field. They are

  marks in the ground. Once
  again, you will have to
  protect the Komodo Trader from
  the monsters. Select six units
  for the battle and begin.

  All of the monsters on the
  field are ice-based, so ice
  attacks will heal them.
  They'll often use their own
  offensive ice attacks against
  themselves to do just that.
  The two Ice Drakes can use Ice
  Breath and the Ice Flans can
  cast Blizzard and Blizzara.
  The Ice Flans are also capable
  of using Acid, which inflicts
  a random status ailment. You
  can easily take down the Ice
  Drakes and Ice Flans by using
  fire- based attacks.

  The Wendigo also absorbs ice,
  but it is weak to lightning.
  This headless monster has high
  attack stats, so keep units
  with lower defenses far away.
  It'll often use Bone Shatter,
  which not only deals heavy
  damage but also delays the
  target's next turn. Brute
  Strength will raise the damage
  of its next attack, and Sunder
  Earth deals damage in a
  straight line, similar to the
  White Monk's Earth Render
  attack.

  The monsters are not the

  up all of the potions that the

  can't let Komodo Potion
  continue it's "good" business.
  It's time to fight for free
  market! Equipment resistant to
  ice-based attacks are STRONGLY
  recommended here.

  This time around, the Komodo
  Trader is invincible, meaning
  there's no need to protect
  him. Therefore, you can go
  ahead and do your job without
  having to worry about him.
  Start off first for the Moogle
  Black Mage. His skills are not
  really noteworthy, though his
  Geomancy can power up Blizzard
  and Blizzara significantly.
  When approaching him, avoid
  grouping your units together.
  Just behind him, the Archer
  can use Cupid, which inflicts
  Charm, and Blackout, which
  inflicts Blind. Avoid getting
  hit with Cupid as best you
  can, but be sure to thwack
  teammates out of Charm status
  should they be affected. You
  should Addle or Disable her to
  prevent her from using her
  abilities.

  The Time Mage will prove to be
  an issue - he is capable of
  casting Slow and Stop. In
  addition, he may use Rime Bolt
  Tome, which deals ice damage
  to all units on-screen
  (including foes). The
  Illusionist in the very corner
  can use Freezeblink, which
  deals ice damage to only your
  units. He'll be a non-factor
  if you took my advice and
  equipped ice-based equipment.
  If not, then you should
  eliminate him as quickly as
  possible, though he can only
  cast Freezeblink every three
  turns due to MP.

  You can expect the Geomancer
  to focus mostly on the Komodo
  Trader for the majority of
  this mission. Leave her for
  last. Her list of spells
  include Shining Flare, which
  deals fire damage only in
  direct sunlight, Avalanche,
  which deals ice damage with a
  chance of inflicting Sleep
  only when it's snowing,
  Nature's Embrace, which deals
  moderate damage only on
  natural terrain, and
  Artifice's Embrace, which
  deals damage and inflicts Slow
  only on artificial terrain.
  Prevent her from casting her
  abilities by inducing Silence
  on her if possible. The
  debuffs attached with her
  spells can be hindering but
  are certainly not devastating.

  For all the help you've been,
  the Komodo Trader will gift
  you a Wyrmtwig as a token of
  his appreciation.

  This is a fairly tough
  mission, especially if you
  select it early in the game.
  Your objective is to protect
  the Komodo Trader - if he
  falls, then you'd have failed
  the mission. It doesn't help
  that the battlefield is a huge
  pain in the neck to navigate
  either. Bring in six fairly
  strong units. Units such as
  Paladins are strongly
  recommended. Black Mages and
  similar units are discouraged
  because the law expressly
  forbids any ability that
  targets an area. On that same
  note, White Mages cannot be
  used because their healing
  spells cover an area.

  As soon as the mission begins,
  move your units up in front of
  Komodo, the Soldier. Komodo is
  a full-fledged coward, so
  don't expect him to do too
  much on his own. If you
  brought in a Paladin with
  Cover, have him use it on
  Komodo for the entirety of the
  mission. If not, then you'll
  have to surround Komodo with
  your stronger units. However,
  you will still have to seek
  out the ranged enemies, which
  include a Fusilier and Archer
  at the upper-left corner of
  the battlefield.

  Whereas your defending units
  should be able to fend off the
  Warriors and Mog Knight, you
  will have to actively seek out
  the Archer and Fusilier first.
  The Fusilier has
  Concentration, which boosts
  his accuracy, but his
  elemental abilities are not
  threatening. The Archer has
  Blackout, which can inflict
  Blind status. A good strategy
  to use here would be to send
  your fastest units up the
  cliff face along the western
  edge of the battlefield. This
  way, they'll be able to climb
  up without running into the
  melee units along the upper-
  right side of the battlefield.
  By doing this, you can push
  the enemy ranged units down
  the north end of the field and
  hopefully lure them
   into your defending party.

  Out of the physical units, the
  Moogle Knight is the most
  dangerous. He can use Moogle
  Lance, a ranged physical
  attack that can get past your
  defending units. He also comes
  with Moogle Attack, which
  knocks back, and Moogle Rush,
  a high-powered attack that
  comes at the expense of
  lowered accuracy. The Warriors
  are not much of an issue, but
  one of them is capable of
  using Body Slam. Assuming your
  defensive line remains,
  neither of them should be
  allowed to get close enough to
  even lay a finger on Komodo.

  There are two treasures on
  this battlefield, but they're
  more trouble to attain than
  they're worth. Eliminate all
  members of the Graszton
  Seaways to complete the
  mission.

  Even among wares as fine as

  Ribbons - one of our finest

  to market. The counterfeiters
  are trying to pass off ribbons
  from the cassie variant of

  The odds are with you in this
  battle - it's stacked four
  versus six. This is a simple
  mission, with your opposition
  consisting solely of four
  Thieves.

  Be wary of the Hume Thief in
  the front, for he has Dual
  Wield. Even so, his attack
  power isn't exceptional
  (knives aren't exactly the
  strongest weapons out there).
  The Moogle Thief also has a
  few Moogle Knight techniques.
  Moogle Attack is a blow that
  knocks back and Moogle Lance
  is a ranged attack. He doesn't
  use these techniques too
  often, opting more often than
  not to just attempt to steal
  your gil.

  The remaining two Thieves are
  no threat at all. They will
  probably spend the entire
  battle attempting to steal
  your gil. Take down all four
  to finish the mission.

C2-10 The Root of the Problem ~

  The counterfeiters recently
  remanded to our custody have
  divulged the source of the
  fake De'vine Ribbons. We'll

  The counterfeiters have been
  tracked to the Galerria Deep.
  Bring in six units for the
  fight and begin.

  Be careful around the enemy
  White Monk. He can use both
  Air Render and Aurablast,
  which can deal excessive
  damage to your party if your
  units are grouped together.
  The Viking is not very
  dangerous - he can cast
  Thundara and use Pickpocket to
  steal some gil, nothing else.
  The Fighter is capable of
  using Rush, which knocks back,
  and Wild Swing, which damages
  surrounding units. Overall
  though, his attack stat isn't
  remarkably high, so he
  shouldn't be much of a threat
  in this battle.

  The Ninja, the fastest unit on
  the enemy side, has just one
  Ninjutsu "Veil" ability at his
  disposal. Fire Veil deals
  light fire damage with a
  chance of inflicting Confuse.
  You can prevent him from using
  it by inflicting Silence
  status on him. Finally, the
  two remaining Thieves are
  fitted with standard Thievery
  abilities. Needless to say,
  there's no need to worry about
  them.

  You should go straight for the
  Ninja and White Monk first,
  for those two can prove to be
  the biggest threat. Next,
  consider going after the
  Fighter and Viking. Leave the
  two useless Thieves for last.
  Once the enemy team is down
  for the count, the mission
  will end.

  Forbidden:
      - Buffs and Debuffs

  Enemies:
          - Cassie x6

  The Cassie variant of the
  Malboro is a deadly thing to
  behold. These Cassies are
  capable of inflicting numerous
  status ailments on your party.
  Therefore, units with
  resistances to debuffs would
  do well in this battle. If
  that's not applicable, then
  send in some ranged units.
  Hunters are particularly
  effective with Sidewinder.

  All the Cassies can use
  Honeyed Breath, which inflicts
  Charm, and Cloying Breath,
  which inflicts Sleep and Slow.
  These breath attacks always
  affect an area in a cone, so
  avoid grouping units together.
  A few of the Cassies can use
  Love Song, which not only
  heals HP, but also grants
  Regen and raises defense.
  Unfortunately, the ones with
  Love Song start in the back of
  the pack, so it's impossible
  to reach them immediately. As
  the battle carries on though,
  prioritize your efforts and
  defeat the Cassies with Love
  Song.

  Resistances to debuffs are
  important here. You can clear
  both Charm and Sleep with a
  thwack on the head should you
  be affected. If your units
  don't have the adequate debuff
  resistance, then keep your
  distance! Getting mobbed by a
  group of Cassies is not fun.
  Be sure to grab the treasures
  on the map while fighting off
  these Cassies. When all have
  been defeated, the mission
  will end.

  Listen to Chita's worthless
  rambling about determination
  and whatnot. This speed battle
  is against a Golem, a fearsome
  headless monster with very
  high attack and defense stats.
  Keep in mind that it has a
  Mirror Mail equipped so magick
  spells are useless here unless
  you
have Pierce set as a P-Ability.

  To make it easier on yourself,
  just let Chita's Weaponers do
  most of the work. The only
  thing you need to do is deal
  the killing blow. The Golem is
  a dangerous monster, with very
  high stats in nearly every
  respect (except speed and
  evade). Its Destroyer
  P-Ability gives it an even
  greater boost. The Golem can
  damage you with various earth-
  based attacks, so wearing
  equipment resistant to said
  element can help out.

  The Golem is weak to wind-
  based attacks, so use those if
  you can. Simply eliminate the
  mark before Chita's Weaponers
  get the chance to, and the
  mission will be complete. It's
  not as if you've actually

  Upon encountering Chita in the
  Galerria Deep, you will be
  thrust into a speed battle
  against a Deathscythe. Bring
  in four units, preferably
  those with holy-based attacks
  because your enemy is undead.
  Speed is important here as
  well seeing that this is a
  "speed" battle after all.

  You can choose to let Chita's
  Weaponers take all the
  punishment while your team
  sits back. In order to win,
  you must deal the killing blow
  to the Deathscythe. The
  Deathscythe itself holds some
  fairly strong attacks,
  including Darkga which deals
  heavy dark damage. It will
  often use this spell to heal
  itself. Its other abilities
  include Doom, Deep Sleep,
  which inflicts Stop and Sleep
  status, and Shackle, which
  Immobilizes and Disables.

  Chita is a powerful Gladiator.
  His Doublehand P-Ability
  boosts his damage quite a bit,
  so you will want to make sure
  he doesn't land the killing
  blow here. His two Warrior
  lackeys are jokes though -
  they should not pose any
  problem here because they're
  so weak. Overall, this is a
  straightforward speed battle
  that's pretty easy to finish.

  While out in the mountains
  searching for a kupoppy
  flower, your party encounters
  a pack of monsters. Send in
  six units for this battle and
  start.

  The monster here consists
  solely of wolves and their
  kin. The most dangerous of
  them all is the red Worgen,
  which has the highest raw
  attack power out of all the
  monsters here. It is capable
  of using Shadowy Blow, which
  has a chance of inflicting
  Blind. Its other ability,
  Screech, can inflict Confuse
  status. Try to prioritize the
  Worgen first, eliminating this
  threat before moving on to the
  rest of the monsters. The
  Worgen has Critical: Quicken,
  so try to kill it without
  placing it in critical health.

  The Wolves can attack with
  Fiery Blow, a fire-based
  attack that has a chance of
  inflicting Silence, and
  Chilling Bow, an ice-based
  attack with a chance of
  inflicting Immobilize status.
  As for the two Werewolves, do
  your best to avoid Slug, which
  lowers defense. Roar removes
  buffs and En Garde places the
  user in a counter status. One
  of the Werewolves can use
  Assault, which inflicts
  Immobilize status.

  Since the objective is not to
  defeat the monsters, rather to
  find the kupoppy flower, all
  you have to do is examine the
  sparkling dots on the ground.
  One of them will hide the
  kupoppy flower.

  high, but his Impervious
  P-Ability blocks from many
  debuffs.

  The other enemies here include
  a Ninja, who boasts a more
  varied list of Ninjutsu
  techniques than the Nightfall,
  Ewen. He can cast Fire Veil
  for fire damage and Confuse
  status, Gold Veil for damage
  and Blind status, and Water
  Veil for water damage and
  Silence status. His Dual Wield
  ability makes him even more of
  a danger than Ewen is. You'll
  want to take him down as
  quickly as possible. At least
  Silence him to prevent him
  from using his "Veil"
  abilities.

  Watch out for the Assassin's
  Ague ability, which can
  inflict Slow. Aphonia inflicts
  Silence status and Leg Shot
  inflicts Immobilize status. If
  you're susceptible to status
  ailments, then you'll want to
  maintain your distance from
  her. The Time Mage acts as the
  healer for the enemy team - he
  can cast Cure. His Time Magick
  includes Haste and Reflect. He
  often Hastes Ewen and the
  other units, who are already
  speedy enough as they are.
  Silence him to disable him
  completely.

  Lastly, the Sniper can use Leg
  Shot and Beso Toxico, which
  inflicts Poison status.
  Compared to the other units,
  she isn't nearly as dangerous,
  so feel free to ignore her
  completely.

  There's no need to really
  bother with the other units if
  you don't feel like getting
  the loot and EXP. Eliminate
  Ewen and be done with it!

  This is a randomized battle.
  The party members of
  Scarface's clan will always
  differ with the exception of
  Scarface himself (Juggler).
  Send in four units of your own
  for this battle. Speed is of
  the essence here since your
  objective is to deal the
  killing blow to the mark. (And
  in case you were wondering,
  the mark is randomized as
  well.)

  The mark is always a very
  strong monster with deadly
  skills. Needless to say,
  you'll need to approach it
  with caution. The only
  permanent member in the
  opposing clan is Scarface, who
  has a variety of Juggler
  techniques. He seems to use
  Smile Toss most often to
  Quicken his teammates, though
  he can also use Molotov
  Cocktail to inflict Berserk
  and Dagger Toss to inflict
  Disable status.

  Approach this mission any way
  you choose. The best way would
  be to have your own units
  stand on the edge of the
  battle while the other clan
  dukes it out with the mark.
  Then, when the mark hits
  critical HP, launch an all-out
  attack on it to quickly
  eliminate it before Scarface
  can.

  If you want to be really
  cheap, you can actually
  inflict status ailments on the
  other clan to hinder their
  ability to fight. That's
  always fun!

         - Fusilier x1
     - Genius Ed (Sage) x1

  The perpetrator is Genius Ed,
  a Sage who's been modifying
  the airships. A new face will
  show here. Yes, it's Vaan from
  Final Fantasy XII, ready to
  claim the "treasure" on the
  airship for himself. As Luso
  and Vaan bicker to each other,
  Genius Ed will call in his
  lackeys. After some more
  "painful" dialogue, the battle
  will
   finally commence. Sheesh.

  The primary objective is
  Genius Ed, but you may want to
  take on the other units to
  make things a bit easier. Vaan
  will help out but won't really
  be much assistance. First of
  all, the White Mage has to go
  because he can cast Cure and
  Esuna. Afterwards, you should
  immediately target the Time
  Mage, who can cast Quicken and
  Slow. Since both spellcasters
  don't have very high defenses,
  you should be able to dispatch
  both quite easily. Just try to
  avoid being Slowed.

  Be wary of the Berserker.
  Smite of Rage deals damage
  while inflicting various
  debuffs. His HP is quite high,
  so you will need to focus your
  efforts to take him down
  quickly. The Moogle Fusilier
  will prove to be a problem
  with his Blindshot and
  Silenceshot techniques, both
  capable of inflicting their
  own eponymous status ailments.
  He otherwise isn't dangerous
  at all, so considering
  inflicting Addle or Disable on
  him to save the trouble of
  actually eliminating him.

  And finally, Genius Ed the
  Sage is capable of casting
  Water, which deals water
  damage, Aero, which deals wind
  damage, and Bio, which deals
  poison damage with a chance of
  inflicting Poison. His
  Immunity renders him resistant
  to certain debuffs, so don't
  count on Silencing him. Note
  that he also has Critical:
  Quicken set as a R-Ability. By
  eliminating him in without
  putting him in critical
   status, you can bypass it.

  Your job here is to clean up
  the six sparkling dots strewn
  across the airship. There is a
  round limit, but it's
  randomized (I usually end up
  getting 2-5 rounds). Units
  with high move stats are
  required here. Enact the Move
  Up clan privilege if
  applicable. If possible, send
  in a unit with the Green
  Magick spell Leap, which
  raises movement.

  Unfortunately, the monsters
  here will get in the way.
  Don't waste turns attempting
  to kill them because they'll
  just slow you down. Since
  there are so many of them,
  some of them may block your
  progress, in which case they
  must be dealt with swiftly to
  clear a path to each mark.
  These hand things have
  ridiculously high speeds as
  well.

  The closest dot is on the
  right front wing. Have your
  unit with the lowest move stat
  go straight for that one.
  There are three more along the
  airship body that can easily
  be attained. However, the two
  toughest marks are on the back
  wings. There is one dot on
  each of the back wings - in
  order to reach them, you will
  need high move stats to
  quickly bring a unit back
  there before the round limit
  runs out.

  Assign one dot to each unit.
  Have the units with the
  highest move stats go for the
  dots on the back wings. When a
  unit has swabbed his or her
  assigned dot, have him or her
  attempt to kill off some
  monsters to facilitate the
  whole cleaning process.

  The law expressly forbids
  ranged weapons, and since Nu
  Mou and Moogles can't cross
  water, bring in only melee
  units with the exception of
  the aforementioned races. The
  objective is to find the lost
  wedding ring, which can be any
  one of the sparkling dots
  strewn across the fens.

  Although the Sprite starts off
  the furthest away, you'll want
  to prioritize it first because
  of its White Wind spell, which
  heals all allies. It can also
  cast Time Magick spells
  Quicken and Extend. If it's
  impossible to kill it early
  on, inflict Silence on it to
  prevent it from using its
  spells. Dark-based attacks are
  particularly effective against
  it.

  The Chocobo pack consists of
  three Chocobos. The Yellow
  Chocobo can only use Choco
  Beak, which isn't remarkably
  damaging, so leave it for
  last. The Green Chocobo, in
  addition to Choco Beak, can
  use Choco Cure to replenish
  the HP of surrounding units
  and Choco Esuna to remove
  debuffs from surrounding
  units. Lastly, the Brown
  Chocobo, in addition to Choco
  Beak and Choco Cure, can use
  Choco Guard to buff defense
  and resistance and grant Regen
  status.

  The two Great Tortoises have
  identical abilities, though
  one of them has Regeneration
  as a R-Ability, whereas the
  other has Counter. Headbutt is
  dangerous because it has a
  chance of inflicting
  Immobilize status. Their other
  ability, Sonic Spin, deals
  damage to surrounding units.
  Great Tortoises boast great
  defense stats, but their
  magick resistance is subpar.
  For that reason, magick would
  be better suited for them.
  Note that they are weak to
  wind-based attacks.

  Examine the dots until you
  come across the wedding ring.
  It's your choice whether or
  not to defeat the monsters.
  However, getting them out of
  the way can make scouring the
  area for the ring make easier.
  There's also treasure chest
  here that you can open if
  you'd like.

          - Wraith x1

  While out searching for the
  rumored treasure, the team
  encounters a group of ghosts.
  For this mission, units with
  holy-based attacks are
  strongly recommended. White
  Mages and Archers/White Monks
  with Burial/Exorcise would
  help here as well. Avoid
  bringing in Moogles or Nu Mou
  because there is too much
  water here (Moogles and Nu Mou
  cannot cross water).

  The Zombie is not a threat in
  this mission - it can use
  Drain Touch to sap HP from its
  target to replenish its own
  HP. You should leave the
  Zombie for last. As for the
  two Floating Eyes, you will
  want to be wary of Death Dive,
  a powerful, suicidal attack
  that they use when in critical
  HP (they both have Critical:
  Quicken). Try to avoid putting
  these monsters in critical
  status for that reason. Their
  other abilities are Supersonic
  Wave, which can inflict
  Silence status, and Gnaw,
  which has a chance of
  inflicting Poison.

  The two Ghosts are capable of
  inflicting Sleep and Silence
  status with Sleep Touch and
  Silence Touch. Lastly, the
  Wraith can use Flash to
  inflict Blind status on
  surrounding units and Wake the
  Dead, which calls in more
  undead monsters. In addition,
  it can cast Darkra on its
  undead brethren to heal their
  HP. You should target the
  Wraith first because it's the
  most dangerous monster
  overall. Avoid putting it in
  critical status though, for
  Critical: Vanish will
  activate, preventing you from
  targeting it.

  All monsters here are weak to
  holy-based attacks. The undead
  (Zombie, Ghost, Wraith) are
  also damaged by curative
  spells. When you take down any
  of the undead, a gravestone
  will remain. After about two
  turns, the undead monster will
  revive itself. There are ways
  to deal with this. Exorcise
  and Burial can both banish the
  gravestone, preventing the
  monster from reviving itself.
  Also, using
a Phoenix Down can work as well.

  In this mission, you will have

  from a group of five Bangaas.
  Bring in six units and start
  the battle. Kyrra needs to be
  kept alive for the entire
  mission, so quickly move your
  units down to him to protect
  him.

  There's no area attacks
  allowed, meaning you'll have
  to rely on abilities that only
  affect a single tile.

  Really, the primary threat in
  this mission is the White Monk
  with the Air Render ability.
  This ranged attack is pretty
  powerful and can pose a
  problem. Go straight for the
  White Monk who has this
  ability first to remove the
  threat. The remaining Bangaas
  aren't very tough. One of the
  Warriors has Rend Power and
  Rend Magick, which can become
  an issue for your attackers.
  Eliminate him as early
    on as possible as well.

  As long as you keep Kyrra
  protected, this battle should
  go pretty quickly. Be sure to

         - Oversoul x1

  The source of the nightmares
  appears to be an Oversoul. The
  monster will call in a team of
  primarily undead foes. For
  that reason, you should send
  in units with holy-based
  attacks. To banish the undead
  for good, consider sending
  units with Burial, Sanctify,
  or Exorcise. Restorative
  spells deal damage to undead
  monsters, so send in White
  Mages and the like as well. In
  order to finish this mission,
  you
   must defeat the Oversoul.

  The Zombie is capable of using
  Drain Touch to sap the
  target's HP to replenish its
  own. Overall, it isn't very
  dangerous. If you're looking
  to finish the mission quickly,
  it would be best to ignore the
  Zombie completely, for your
  objective is only the
  Oversoul. The Bloody Orb is
  similar in that its sole
  ability, Vampire, saps HP from
  the target to heal itself. The
  Bloody Orb is the least threat
  because its attack power is
  very low in comparison to the
  other enemies.

  Be careful of the Wraiths'
  Flash ability. This move
  inflicts Blind status on
  surrounding units. Their other
  ability, Wake the Dead, can
  summon more undead monsters.
  The Wraiths will frequently
  use Dark to heal themselves
  and the other monsters that
  absorb dark (the Zombie and
  Oversoul). Both Wraiths have
  Blood Price, meaning HP is
  consumed instead of MP.
  Finally, the Oversoul itself
  has a variety of malicious
  abilities. Deep Sleep inflicts
  Stop and Sleep status, and
  Shackle inflicts Disable and
  Immobilize status. Be prepared
  to use Esuna/Esunaga or
  Refresh to remove any debuffs
  that it inflicts on you. In
  addition, the Oversoul can
  cast Darkga, a powerful dark-
  based spell that deals heavy
  damage. Much like the Wraiths,
  the Oversoul frequently uses
  it to heal itself and the
  other undead.

  All of the monsters here are
  weak to holy-based attacks.
  The undead monsters (which is
  all enemies sans Bloody Orb).
  Recall that when an undead
  monster is killed, it can
  regenerate itself in a few
  turns. In order to prevent any
  downed monsters from reviving,
  use Exorcise/ Sanctify/Burial
  to banish the monster forever.
  If you use those abilities on
  the tombstone of a downed
  undead monster, you will have
  no chance at missing.

  The sole objective here is the
  Oversoul. Feel free to
  completely ignore the other
  monsters. Both the Zombie and
  Bloody Orb are too weak to
  pose any significant threat in
  this battle, though you may
  find it easier to just kill
  them off quickly. The Wraiths,
  with their Flash ability, can
  be a nuisance, so you should
  eliminate them early on. When
  the Oversoul is defeated, the
  mission will end.

  The King Marlboro can use

          - Soldier x1
          - Warrior x1

  As you can see from the three
  Fighters, this enemy team is
  mostly physical. Take units
  that have adequate defense
  because you may have trouble
  otherwise.

  The Warrior and Soldier are
  not remarkably dangerous -
  both have Rend Power and Rend
  Magick, which pose more as a
  nuisance than anything else.
  I'd recommend inflicting
  Disable or Stop on them to
  prevent them from using their
  abilities to hinder your team.
  It's easier to do that because
  both of them have
  exceptionally high defense.
  Afterwards, when everyone else
  is down, you can focus on
  these last two without much
  trouble.

  Ignore the Thief because the
  only thing he can do is steal
  your gil and stuff. As for the
  Fighters, only one of them
  (Jeorge) is dangerous. The
  other two "lackeys" are fitted
  with Blitz, which deals light
  damage, Beat Down, which deals
  heavy damage with low
  accuracy, and Rush, which
  knocks back a unit. Both have
  Doublehand as their P-Ability,
  so damage will be boosted.
  Jeorge can use Wild Swing,
  which damages surrounding
  units, Air Render, and
  Aurablast, a ranged attack
  that deals damage over an
  area. His R-Ability,
  Bonecrusher, is quite
  damaging, so try to deal
  damage from far away to avoid
  activating it.

  Completing this job will
  unlock the Fighter job for the
  Hume.

 C4-05 Popocho's Chocobos ~

  Kupo! My precious chocobos
  have all run off! Every last
  one of them! It looks like
  they've headed for the

  Range. I need someone to find
  them before the monsters do,

  There are three distinct
  battles for this mission that
  you must complete in order to
  accomplish the mission.

  Forbidden:
          - >50 Damage

  Enemies:
           - Wolf x1
         - Werewolf x2
          - Zaghnal x1

  This battle in the Aldanna
  Range region of the Aldanna
  Range (redundant, much?) pits
  you against a Wolf, two
  Werewolves, and a Zaghnal. The
  objective is to defend the
  Yellow Chocobo that is
  situated at the opposite
  corner of your starting
  position, perilously
  positioned right next to a
  Werewolf! Bring in at least
  one restorative unit (White
  Mage) in addition to a Paladin
  (with Cover) if applicable.
  Speed is important here, so
  the other two units should be
  quick enough to outrun the
  other monsters. I'd also
  recommend that you activate a
  Move Up clan privilege to
  facilitate the battle.

  Heed no attention to the
  Zaghnal at first because it's
  too far away to be an
  immediate threat to the
  Chocobo. Instead, go straight
  for the Werewolf. Remember
  that waiting allows the next
  turn to come around more
  quickly, so avoid doing any
  actions on the approach. The
  Chocobo luckily outspeeds the
  Werewolf next to it, so it
  should be able to fend for
  itself during the first turn.

  Don't waste time. Have your
  Paladin use Cover on the
  Chocobo immediately. If you
  don't have a Paladin
  available, then cast Protect
  on it. Have your other units
  begin working away at the
  monsters. The Wolf can use
  Screech, which has a chance of
  inflicting Confuse. The
  Werewolves can use En Garde,
  which puts them in counter
  status, and Assault, which has
  a chance of inflicting
  Immobilize status. If
  possible, Stop, Disable, or
  put some of the monsters to
  Sleep to effectively prevent
  the enemies from attacking the
  Chocobo.

  Early in the mission, the
  Zaghnal will not be a factor
  because it's so slow. However,
  as this battle carries on,
  don't let that green
  abomination approach! Its Slug
  ability can deal significant
  damage. Its other abilities
  include Roar, which dispels
  all units on the field, and
  Howl, which is an area MP-
  damaging that inflicts
  Confuse. It may be tough to
  take down, so focus all of
  your attacks on it to kill it
  before it can cause any
  problems.

  Forbidden:
      - Action by Moogles

  Enemies:
         - Ice Flan x2
          - Wendigo x2

  This second battle occurs in
  the Whitesnow Pass of the
  Aldanna Range. The strategy
  here remains the same as the
  previous fight. The only
  difference here is that there
  are now two Green Chocobos you
  must rescue. It doesn't help
  that both of them are
  surrounded by monsters. Again,
  bring in Paladins with Cover,
  along with curative units.
  Speed is also very important
  here.

  Send your slower two units to
  deal with the Ice Flan and
  Wendigo nearest your starting
  position. Either use Cover on
  the Green Chocobo or cast
  Protect on it. These Green
  Chocobos can actually use
  Choco Barrier to put Protect
  and Shell on themselves, which
  helps quite a bit. Send your
  speedier units to deal with
  the Green Chocobo at the far
  corner.

  The Wendigos should be the
  primary priority here because
  they can use Bone Shatter,
  which deals heavy damage and
  delays the target's turn,
  along with Sunder Earth which
  deals damage in a line in
  front of the monster. Brute
  Strength raises the power of
  the next physical attack,
  which can prove to be deadly
  to these fragile Chocobos. If
  possible, use debuffs to
  prevent these Wendigos from
  attacking. Unfortunately, the
  Chocobos may sometimes attack
  these Wendigos directly only
  to be hit with Bonecrusher. Be
  sure to heal to maintain their
  HP.

  The Ice Flans are much less of
  a problem here, but they can
  use Acid to inflict a random
  status ailment. Be sure to
  have someone on hand to
  cleanse a unit should they be
  affected. The Green Chocobos
  may lend a helping hand (or
  wing?) as well by using Choco
  Esuna. Anyway, eliminate the
  four monsters here to save
  these two Chocobos. Be sure to
  grab the treasure sitting in
  the middle of the field.

  Forbidden:
       - Action by Humes

  Enemies:
           - Ghost x1
         - Ice Drake x2
           - Zahak x1

  This final fight takes place
  in the Orchid Snowfields. This
  is a challenging fight, not
  only because you have to
  protect Popocho (the Chocobo
  Knight with a severe speech
  impediment) and his two other
  Chocobos, but because the
  monsters here have abilities
  that can be deadly. And
  remember, you cannot allow
  Popocho or his Chocobos to be
  taken down.

  Clearly, the Zahak is the
  biggest threat here. However,
  it's too far away to be an
  immediate threat, so begin
  focusing on the Ghost and Ice
  Drakes. Recall that Ghosts are
  undead, so they can be damaged
  by using curative spells. Holy
  attacks are very effective as
  well. It can inflict Sleep and
  Silence, so eliminate it
  quickly. When it is brought to
  0 HP, use a Phoenix Down or
  Exorcise (Hume skills are
  banned here, but if you ignore
  laws, then Burial works as
  well) on the tombstone to
  banish it forever.

  The Ice Drakes are a bit more
  dangerous. Their Sleet ability
  can inflict Doom and Sleep
  status. This can be bad news
  for the two Chocobos and
  Popocho because they're
  susceptible to Doom. Induce
  Disable, Stop, or Addle status
  on the Ice Drakes to prevent
  them from using Sleet. Should
  either of the three mission
  critical units be Doomed, cast
  Refresh or Esunaga on them
  immediately. The Ice Drakes'
  other ability is Ice Breath,
  which deals area ice damage.
  Ice Drakes are weak to fire-
  based attacks, so use those
  for extra damage.

  What you should do with the
  Zahak is surround it with your
  fighters to prevent it from
  approaching the Chocobos. The
  Zahak has a ton of HP, so
  killing it will take some
  time. It's very powerful, and
  can cast Mighty Guard on
  itself to raise defense and
  resistance. It can also use
  Expose Weakness to lower the
  defense and resistance of its
  target. Ice Orb and Ice Breath
  are both ice attacks that deal
  moderate damage. Use holy-
  based attacks because the
  Zahak is weak to that element,
  but stay away from ice, fire,
  lightning, and dark-based
  attacks.

  Once Popocho and his Chocobos
  are safe, he will reward you
  with the Chocobo Knight job
  for the Moogle.

  C4-06 Of Kupos and Cannons ~
 =------------------------=
  Strange noises punctuate the
  night. There's naught but
  trees and the occasional
  abandoned well for many
  leagues, yet the din of
  "kupo"s and firearms is quite
  overwhelming. I can scarcely
  focus, never mind study, and
  so I find myself turning to
  frivolous fictions.
  Predictably, my schoolwork has
  begun to suffer and my very
  future is now in peril. Please
  find the cause of the nuisance
  and put a stop to it!

      - Flintlock (spawns)

  In the middle of the night,
  your party encounters a group
  of Flintlocks. Of course, they
  get pretty hostile once you
  arrive. Send in six units for
  the battle and commence!

  In case you are not familiar
  with Flintlocks, know that
  Flintlocks must take an extra
  turn to Prime their cannons.
  This free turn can give you an
  opportunity to close the
  distance and start doing some
  damage. All of the Flintlocks
  can use either Ether Boost,
  which deals damage, or Protect
  Cannon, which puts Protect and
  Regen status on one of their
  allies. There's no limit to
  the amount of Flintlocks
  - they will all spawn from the
    wells (???). The objective
    is to
  survive for four rounds, which
  shouldn't be remarkably tough.

  The best way to deal with this
  mission would be to position a
  unit at each well. First of
  all, take out the Flintlock at
  each of the wells. Then, keep
  your unit there to guard the
  well, quickly eliminating any
  Flintlocks that come in. As
  stated before, Flintlocks must
  Prime their weapons, so you
  should have plenty of time to
  severely hurt each Flintlock
  before they can even act.

  You may have trouble as the
  Flintlocks begin appearing
  more quickly. Just hold your
  positions, knocking down the
  Flintlocks as you wait. When
  four rounds are up, the
  mission will end.

  Completing the mission will
  get you the Flintlock job for
  the Moogle.

  Send in four units here to
  assist Mayhew of Prima Donna
  in finding the lost
  concertina. Her devotees
  haven't been of much use, so
  it is to you now. As luck
  would have it, monsters are
  here to make things difficult.

  The monsters here aren't
  remarkably tough to take down.
  The two Ice Drakes are both
  capable of using Ice Breath,
  and one of them has Counter.
  You can quickly eliminate
  these two by using fire-based
  attacks, which the Ice Drakes
  are weak to. The Lamia here
  doesn't have any dangerous
  abilities. Hand Slap only
  delays a unit's turn. Just be
  grateful you don't have to
  deal with Night or Twister.
  Ugh.

  Lastly, the Bloody Orb may
  give you complications with
  Supersonic Wave, which
  inflicts Silence, but it isn't
  much of a threat either. Its
  Vampire ability saps HP -
  watch out for this attack.
  Once you've defeated all
  monsters one way or another,
  inspect each of the sparkling
  dots on the ground until you
  find the concertina.

  Mayhew will unlock the Raptor
  job for the Gria following the
   completion of the mission.

  Against these eyeball
  monsters, you will want to
  send in units with resistances
  to status ailments. Apart from
  their debuff skills, these
  monsters are not remarkably
  difficult to defeat.

  The Bloody Orbs are capable of
  using Supersonic Wave to
  inflict Silence status.
  Spellcasters should do their
  best to avoid getting hit by
  this attack. Vampire saps HP
  from the target to replenish
  the Bloody Orb's own. The
  Floating Eyes can also use
  Supersonic Wave, in addition
  to Gnaw, which can inflict
  Poison status.

  Ahrimans are the most
  dangerous because of their
  Enthrallment abilities.
  Demonic Gaze can inflict
  Confuse and Bewitching Glance
  can induce Charm and Slow
  status. These abilities can be
  avoided by simply not looking
  at the Ahriman. If a unit is
  facing the opposite direction,
  Demonic Gaze and Bewitching
  Glance will have a 0% success
  rate.

  Always have your units face
  the opposite direction from
  the Ahrimans to avoid getting
  hit by their abilities. Units
  that already have resistances
  to the aforementioned debuffs
  obviously should not need to
  worry about turning their
  backs. Clear the airship of
  the infestation to finish the
  mission.

  After a misunderstanding, the
  Prima Donna clan decides to
  engage you for attempting to
  peek on them bathing. Your
  objective is to prevent all of
  them from entering the water
  (for reasons unknown?). Send
  in units with the ability to
  inflict status ailments such
  as Immobilize to prevent the
  enemy from moving towards the
  water.

  Don't put too much effort in
  defeating the two Devotees to
  the east side of the
  battlefield. They are easily
  eliminated because of their
  low HP and level. The Lanista
  can use Souleater and Sword of
  Darkness to inflict dark-based
  damage, and the Time Mage can
  cast Haste and Slow. It is
  recommended that you knock out
  these two Devotees early on in
  the mission to prevent them
  from becoming a nuisance as
  the battle progresses.

  The Spellblade may prove to be
  an issue with her Poison Blade
  and Stun Blade abilities,
  which can inflict Poison
  status and Immobilize status,
  respectively. In addition, she
  can also use Death Sickle,
  which inflicts Doom status.
  Consider Addling her to
  prevent her from using her
  abilities. Her attack is quite
  powerful as well, so keep
  weaker units away from her.
  The Fencer, on the other hand,
  is Prima Donna's primary
  healer, as she can cast Earth
  Heal. Her other ability,
  Nighthawk, is a ranged attack.
  Out of all of the enemies,
  this Fencer has the highest
  attack stat, and her Charged
  Attack P-Ability further
  increases her damage output.

  The Hunter has Geomancy
  abilities Shining Flare, which
  deals fire damage only in
  sunlight, Venom Squall, which
  deals damage with a chance of
  inflicting Poison only in
  rain, Life's Embrace, which
  has a chance of inflicting
  Immobilize status only on
  grassy terrain, and Earth's
  Embrace, which can inflict
  Disable status only on barren
  land. Since the abilities she
  can use is determined by the
  conditions, she isn't
  remarkably dangerous. Lastly,
  the Raptor can be a dangerous
  enemy. She can use Soul Crush
  to deal both HP and MP damage,
  along with Shield Bash, which
  can inflict Disable.

  Try to Immobilize the enemies
  as they approach to prevent
  them from being able to move
  closer to the pool of water.
  Leave a wall of your strongest
  units along the edge of the
  water to stop any Prima Donna
  members from reaching it. Note
  that the Gria can fly over
  your units, so you need to
  take active measures to
  eliminate them before they get
  close to the water's edge.

  The Tri-Bangaa Temple team
  consists primarily of Master
  Monks and White Monks. Send in
  six for this battle.

  Both White Monks are capable
  of using Roundhouse, which
  damages all surrounding units.
  Their attack is not very high,
  so these White Monks won't be
  a significant threat in this
  battle. The Master Monks, on
  the other hand, are a bit more
  dangerous. Their defense far
  exceeds the White Monks,
  meaning you'll need to focus
  your attacks on them to
  eliminate them quickly. Their
  abilities include Pummel,
  which attacks with two
  consecutive punches, and Dark
  Fist, which sacrifices HP to
  pierce its target (can hit two
  tiles out). Lifebane has a
  chance of inflicting Doom, and
  Withering Strike deals heavy
  damage when the user is at low
  HP. Some of the Master Monks
  can also use the White Monk
  ability, Air Render, which
  deals ranged damage.

  This is a straightforward
  fight. Keep an eye on the
  left-most Master Monk because
  he can use Withering Strike
  and Lifebane. Do not ever
  leave him in critical health
  unless you want to take heavy
  damage from Withering Strike.
  All have Unscarred as their

  power of its next attack, and
  Helmsplitter has a chance of
  destroying a helm! Also, do
  not hit either of the Wendigos
  with standard physical melee
  attacks because you'll end up
  taking a nasty hit back from
  either Bonecrusher or
  Strikeback.

  The Zaghnal, in addition to
  his high attack power, can use
  Roar to remove buffs from all
  units, along with Slug and
  Assault, which can Immobilize
  its target. As for the two
  Wolves, don't expect much
  trouble of out of them. Fangs
  deals moderate damage, but
  it's nothing in comparison to
  the other three heavy-hitters.

  If you have any trouble with
  this mission, you are probably
  not getting to Roye quickly
  enough. Again, units with high
  movement stats are
  instrumental here. Also note
  that Roye's defense isn't
  exceptional, so considering
  casting Protect on him.
  Reraise status will guarantee
  that he survives to live
  another turn. For the most
  part, he should be able to
  fend for himself for a while
  because he can use Magick
  Frenzy, in addition to Cura.

  Complete the mission and Roye
  will teach you the secrets of
  the Seer job for the Humes.
  The Seer job will subsequently
  be unlocked. Zap!

  Forbidden:
         - Restoring MP

  Enemies:
           - Antlion
          - Pit Beast

  The objective here is to
  defend the tree while killing
  off 10 enemy monsters. Since
  you're dealing with so many,
  considering sending in a
  Hunter with Sidewinder or
  Oust. The critical objective
  to this mission is preventing
  any monster from reaching the
  big tree. This means you can't
  allow a single monster to
  reach any tile next to the
  tree.

  Really, the smartest thing to
  do would be to just pile your
  units around the tree so no
  enemies can get past. Put
  ranged units right next to the
  tree and stack stronger melee
  units outside. This way, your
  ranged units can attack from
  behind the barrier while your
  physical units dish out pain
  on the edges.

  This isn't a difficult
  mission. The Antlions can use
  Mucus and Saliva, which both
  reduce speed one way or
  another (Mucus inflicts Slow
  status). In this battle
  though, speed is not really
  much of an issue. Still, be
  wary of Bile, which lowers
  defense and resilience. Be
  sure to heal whenever
  necessary.

  As the mission progresses,
  more and more monsters will
  emerge. Take care around the
  Pit Beasts, which are
  essentially stronger versions
  of Antlions. These monsters
  are fitted with more deadly
  abilities. Sandstorm deals
  damage to an area with a
  chance of inflicting Blind
  status and Suffocate delays a
  target's turn. Blind status
  can be irritating, but that
  can be rid of through Eye
  Drops or any status- healing
  ability.

  Finish off 10 monsters without
  letting any of them touch the
  tree to complete the mission.
  If you find that some of the
  monsters are just wandering
  around aimlessly, then you
  should break out of defense
  mode and approach them, but do
  not allow them anywhere near
  the tree.

  Also, there's a treasure chest
  near the tree, but I
  personally wouldn't go through
  the trouble of getting it.

  Reward: 2650 Gil, Fire Sigil

  This is a three-part battle in
  which you must travel to three
  locations. All of these areas
  are located on the Moorabella
  continent.

  Forbidden:
      - Ice

  Enemies:
      - Yellow Chocobo x1
          - Antlion x2
         - Pit Beast x1
      - Great Tortoise x1

  In the Zedlei Forest, your
  objective is to kill off every
  monster EXCEPT for the blue
  Pit Beast. Send in six units
  and begin the fight.

  The two Antlions will make
  things difficult in this
  battle. Bile lowers defense
  and resilience, Mucus inflicts
  Slow, and Saliva lowers speed.
  Units with resistances to any
  of these debuffs can tread
  without worry, for the
  Antlions themselves have very
  weak attacks. Try to Disable
  them to prevent them from
  using any of their abilities.

  The Great Tortoise is very
  slow, so it won't be much of a
  factor here. It can use
  Headbutt, which can
  potentially inflict Immobilize
  status, and Sonic Spin, which
  damages surrounding units.
  Avoid putting it in critical
  health due to Critical:
  Quicken. As for the Yellow
  Chocobo, kill it off quickly.
  It can use Choco Cure to heal
  allies, along with Choco Beak,
  which deals moderate damage.
  Lastly, the blue Pit Beast
  (which you are not supposed to
  kill) can use Suffocate, which
  delays the target's next turn.
  It also has the R- Ability,
  Bonecrusher, which should be a
  non-factor since you are not
  supposed to kill it.

  Forbidden:
      - Fire

  Enemies:
          - Antlion x4
         - Pit Beast x1

  At the Bisga Greenlands,
  you'll encounter a green Pit
  Beast among a pack of red
  Antlions. Again, the objective
  is to capture the unique one
  by killing off the defending
  Antlions.

  Each Antlion can use Mucus,
  which inflicts Slow, and
  Saliva, which lowers speed. A
  few of them can in addition
  use Bile, which lowers defense
  and resilience, and Suffocate,
  which delays the target's next
  turn. Since debuffs are the
  primary threat here, units
  with debuff resistance should
  be able to finish this mission
  easily. If not, then you
  should contend with the
  Antlions by debuffing them
  first in order to prevent them
  from using their abilities.

  Antlions aren't very tough
  monsters to kill. Eliminate
  the four Antlions guarding the
  green Pit Beast to finish this
  segment of the mission. There
  is a treasure chest in the
  middle of the field - steal
  the contents if you'd like.

  Forbidden:
          - Lightning

  Enemies:
          - Sprite x1
           - Lamia x2
         - Werewolf x2
         - Pit Beast x1

  The white Pit Beast is the
  objective here. Kill off every
  single monster except for the
  objective. You will want to
  bring in units resistant to
  status ailments in this
  battle, considering that
  you're facing two Lamias.

  The Sprite will usually start
  the battle off by casting
  Reflect, which reflects any
  magick casted on it back at
  the caster. That's no problem,
  since physical units can do
  just fine. The Sprite can also
  cast Meteorite for moderate
  damage. The two Werewolves are
  not very threatening. One of
  them can only use En Garde to
  put itself in a counter status
  - it can also use Items to
  cleanse debuffs from its
  teammates with Remedies. The
  other Werewolf is capable of
  using Roar, which removes all
  debuffs from every unit, Slug,
  which is a powerful attack
  that ignores defense, and
  Assault, which deals damage
  with a chance of inflicting
  Immobilize status. Both the
  Werewolves boast high defenses
  and HP, so it's recommended
  that you save them for last.

  The Lamias are particularly
  annoying in this battle. The
  one on the left can use
  Poisonous Frog to inflict
  Poison and Toad status, along
  with Hand Slap, which delays
  the target's next turn. The
  other can cast Night to put
  every unit on the battlefield
  to sleep, along with Twister,
  which cuts 50% HP of units in
  an area.

  Prioritize the Lamias and
  Sprite first. Be sure to
  cleanse units of any debuffs
  they get hit with. Once those
  are down for the count, start
  focusing your attacks on the
  Werewolves. When all the
  monsters (except for the white
  Pit Beast of course) have been
  eliminated, the mission will
  end.

        - Cockatrice x2
        - Adamantitan x1
          - Axebeak x1

  The pages of the recipe are
  scattered all over the place.
  There are six pages total, and
  you have to collect all of
  them. Unfortunately, some
  monsters are here to make
  things tough.

  If you have spellcasters at
  hand, have them target the
  Adamantitan on the ledge. If
  not, then you will have to
  save it for later. Be very
  careful around this gold-
  shelled monster, for it can
  use Munch to destroy
  equipment! For that reason,
  it's best to deal with it from
  far away in order to prevent
  it from getting close enough
  to eat your equipment. Take
  advantage of its weakness to
  wind.

  The Lamia, at the base of the
  first set of steps, can use
  Night, which inflicts Sleep
  status on all units, Hand
  Slap, which delays the
  target's next turn, and
  Twister, which affects an
  area, lowering HP by 50%. The
  last attack is the most
  devastating, so make sure you
  do not group your units
  together. The Bloody Orb is no
  threat at all
  - it can only use Vampire to
    drain HP. Focus on the Lamia
    first
  before moving further up the
  path.

  The two Cockatrices and
  Axebeak sitting at the top of
  the ruins won't be much of a
  threat until you approach
  their position. They will
  mostly cast Scurry and Wake-Up
  Call among themselves to grant
  Haste and Quicken. None of
  them are hard to defeat,
  though the Axebeak has
  comparatively higher attack.
  Once the monsters are dead or
  incapacitated, gather up the
  papers to complete the
  mission.

  This team of monsters is
  capable of inflicting various
  debuffs on your party, so
  considering sending in units
  with debuff resistances and/or
  units who can cleanse debuffs.
  Refresh and Esuna can be
  useful here.

  The two Deadly Nightshades
  should be the least concern.
  That said, you will still want
  to avoid Tomato Ketchup
  because it inflicts Berserk.
  Tomato Tackle lowers speed,
  which can also be a problem.
  The Dreamhare is capable of
  using Hip Attack, along with
  Blind and Silence, whereas the
  Hoppy Bunny can use Illude,
  which inflicts Charm, Go-Go
  Dance, which Hastes a group,
  and the Green Magick spell
  Sleep. Lastly, the Sprite can
  cast Meteorite for moderate
  damage, in
   addition to Slow and Stop.

  You can easily disable most of
  the monsters here by simply
  casting Silence on them. This
  would effectively prevent them
  from using any of their magick
  (the Deadly Nightshades aren't
  affected by Silence because
  their techniques don't cast
  MP, mind). Since none of the
  monsters here have
  particularly high defense
  stats, killing them shouldn't
  pose any difficulty. You
  should focus first on the
  Hoppy Bunny because it likes
  to use Go-Go Dance constantly
  to Haste its allies.

  Search the grounds, inspecting
  each sparkling dot on the
  ground until you've collected
  all of Udite's papers. Once
  that's done, the mission will
  end.

  This is a nondescript

  Antlions. At this point in the
  game, you've probably fought
  enough Antlions to know that
  they aren't much trouble to
  defeat. Bring in six units of
  your own and begin the fight.

  Antlion techniques usually
  come attached with some status
  debuff. Sandstorm damages
  units in an area with a chance
  of inflicting Blind. Mucus can
  inflict Slow status, and
  Saliva lowers speed. Bile can
  lower defense and resilience,
  and Suffocate delays a
  target's next turn. Blind and
  Slow can easily be remedied
  through Esuna (Esunaga too) or
  Refresh, and the speed issue
  can be fixed through Haste.

  If you can prevent the
  Antlions from using their
  abilities through Addling them
  or some other method, this
  battle should go by much more
  quickly. Of course, units with
  resistance to status ailments
  should have little trouble in

  You need to clean all of the
  sparkling dots off of the
  airship within a set round
  limit. The limit is randomized
  (although in my experience, it
  ranges from 2-5) every time.
  Units with high move stats are
  necessary here. If possible,
  activate the Move Up clan
  privilege to facilitate the
  cleaning process. The Green
  Mage's Leap
 skill would help here as well.

  There are six points in the
  all. The first is on the front
  right wing. This one can
  easily be accessed by one of
  your units with lower move
  stats. There are three more
  along the body of the airship,
  and there is one on each of
  the back wings. Assign one
  cleaning mark per unit, making
  sure to distribute the
  farthest dots on the front
  wings to your units with the
  highest move and speed stats.

  Luso manages to find the
  strawood, but he also
  encounters a hostile Alchemist
  with a bunch of monsters on
  his side. Just your luck, huh?
  Send in units with high
  defense stats because the
  primary threat on the enemy
  team are the formidable Golems
  - these monsters can pack a
  huge punch.

  The law specifically states
  that harming female units is
  forbidden. For that reason,
  you will have to ignore the
  Gria Raptor if you want to
  uphold the law. She is a
  nuisance with her Raptor
  abilities, but overall, she is
  not a significant threat. She
  has a tendency to use Power
  Crush, which is bad news for
  your units since it lowers
  defense in the process. The
  Ranger is irritating, since he
  can put down Sten Needle and
  Leech traps. Additionally, he
  can use Mirror Items to
  inflict damage through items,
  but that technique is rarely
  used.

  The two Golems boast high
  attack stats, so they should
  be avoided as best you can.
  Their abilities include Bone
  Shatter, which deals heavy
  damage and delays the target's
  next turn, Sunder Earth, which
  deals earth damage in a
  straight line, and Brute
  Strength, which raises the
  Golem's attack power in the
  next round. Consider attacking
  the Golems with ranged units
  to avoid getting knocked out
  by their high-power attacks.
  Use wind-based attacks because
  the
Golems are weak to that element.

  Of course, the Alchemist is
  the target, but he is not very
  powerful himself. His only
  Alchemy techniques include
  Astra, which grants Astra
  status to his allies (makes
  unit impervious to all status
  ailments) and Rasp, which
  deals MP damage. However, he
  can use the Beast Lore ability
  Headless to take control of
  the Golems himself. Other than
  that, he is hardly a threat.

  Treasure Detector, it should
  be a breeze. This is a great
  mission that you should repeat
  every year because the items
  can be pretty nice.

  When you walk over a treasure,
  a 'Check Detector' command
  will appear. This means you've
  found something. Sometimes,
  you will find a small
  treasure. It's usually best to
  pass these up for the large
  treasures, which are typically
  more valuable. You can choose
  not to dig at any spot. To
  finish the mission, dig up
  three treasures.

     - Deathscythe (spawns)

  Off to Shadeholme, a
  supposedly haunted location.
  Of course, what do you find
  there but ghosts? Your job is
  to defend the Head Editor from
  the ghosts. He won't really do
  much to fend for himself, so
  it is all up to you. Bring in
  six units for the ensuing
  battle. A White Mage with
  Esuna or any other unit with
  an ability that heals status
  ailments is strongly
  suggested. Resistances to
  status ailments would help
  significantly as well. Also,
  curative magick will actually
  damage the undead, so White
  Mages are very useful here.

  Undead units will
  automatically resurrect
  themselves after some time.
  There are methods you can use
  to put them down permanently.
  if you have a White Mage on
  hand, you can deal damage by
  using curative spells. Avoid
  using Exorcise, Burial, or
  other similar skills (that
  vanquish undead) because more
  monsters will spawn to replace
  the dead ones.

  The Ghosts are capable of
  using Flash, which inflicts
  Blind, Sleep Touch, which
  inflicts Sleep, Silence Touch,
  which inflicts Silence, and
  Wake the Dead, which summons
  more undead. A few of them can
  cast Dark, which deals dark
  damage. Ghosts are dark-based,
  so take advantage of their
  weakness to holy-based attacks
  if possible. Since these
  Ghosts like to inflict various
  status ailments on your party,
  be prepared to use items or
  cast Esuna to cleanse your
  units.

  Darkscythes are much more
  dangerous. Doom is self-
  explanatory, Deep Sleep puts a
  unit to sleep AND inflicts
  Stop status at the same time,
  and Shackle Immobilizes and
  Disables. Their Darkra spell
  is an improved version of the
  Dark spell.

  The key here is the Head
  Editor. Unfortunately, the
  bumbling idiot won't stay
  still and you'll have to
  follow him around. Defend him
  from the onslaught of undead
  as you kill them all off. To
  prevent them from using their
  annoying abilities, consider
  Berserking or Disabling them.
  The Ghosts and Deathscythes
  don't have very strong
  defense, so you can take them
  down quickly. Just don't let
  them resurrect themselves or
  you'll have to deal with them
  all over again.

  A good strategy would be to
  reduce every enemy's HP on the
  field until all of them are in
  a critical or near-critical
  state. Then, when you are sure
  you can kill each and every
  one of them within a single
  strike, systematically have
  all of your units take a ghost
 and kill it in one swift turn.

  There are two treasure chests
  in the middle of the
  battlefield. Pick them up
  whenever you have a free turn.

           - Ninja x1

  This is an interesting
  mission. While out helping the
  Head Editor get his scoop,
  you're interrupted by
  reporters of the Jylland Free
  Press. You know what happens
  when journalists collide? Why,
  they duke it out of course!
  Send in six units, preferably
  those with higher speed and
  move stats.

  The objective here is to reach
  the Galmia Pepe P.R. first.
  You only need to send one of
  your units to stand next to
  him in order to complete the
  objective. Move your fastest
  unit towards the P.R. while
  the remainder of your party
  stalls the Jylland Free Press.
  Prioritize the Time Mage first
  because he can cast Haste and
  Quicken to speed up his own
  allies. Be wary of the Ninja
  as well, whose high speed
  stats makes him a potential
  contender for the scoop.
  Either take him down or
  Immobilize him to prevent him
  from going anywhere. He can
  cast Water Veil to inflict
  Silence, so have spellcasters
  maintain their distance.

  The remaining two units should
  hardly be a problem in this
  battle. The Geomancer can only
  use Shining Flare, which deals
  fire damage over a small area
  (only usable in sunny
  weather), and Nature's
  Embrace, which is an attack
  that deals moderate damage but
  can only hit if the target is
  standing on natural terrain
  (ie. grass). And lastly, the
  Green Mage can cast Shell and
  Leap. The latter spell
  increases movement.

  To finish the mission, have
  one unit stand next to the
  P.R. at the upper-left.
  There's no command - you just
  have to wait.

  Go to Moorabella to find the
  Bonga Bugle Head Editor again.
  He will conduct a short
  interview, in which you have
  to express your love for Prima
  Donna (last option) or get
  out. Your objective is
  Fluorgis
  - head over there now.

  Forbidden:

           - Thief x1
         - Blue Mage x1
          - Hunter x1
          - Archer x1

  You can only bring three units
  into this relatively easy
  battle. A group of kidnappers
  have set their sights on Prima
  Donna, and it's up to you to
  fend them off. It's not as if
  Prima Donna really need the
  extra help since they can
  really just manage on their
  own. You are fighting
  alongside Prima Donna this
  time around, and they will
   prove to be a huge asset.

  The Head Editor needs to be
  protected, so make sure you
  keep him safe. The enemy Thief
  is fairly quick, but his
  attack stat is laughably low.
  Unless you are afraid of him
  stealing some gil, you need
  not prioritize him. He can
  additionally use Rend MP to
  damage MP and Rend Speed to
  lower speed. The Blue Mage, on
  the other hand is more a
  nuisance than anything. White
  Wind is a curative spell, Bad
  Breath inflicts Blind,
  Silence, and Poison, and Quake
  deals earth damage to a group
  of units. Focus on the Blue
  Mage to prevent the Jyrtas
  Pirata clan from healing
  themselves.

  The Hunter is equipped with an
  Arbalest, so her attack power
  is a bit stronger than the
  others. She can use Sonic Boom
  to target a group of units.
  Additionally, she can attack
  with Power Crush and Mind
  Crush, which lower defense and
  magick resistance
  respectively. Lastly, the
  Archer is capable of using
  Cupid to induce Charm status.
  Make sure you eliminate her as
  quickly as possible. If you
  can Addle or Disable her,
  that'd be even better.

  Prima Donna can mostly fend
  for themselves, so focus on
  protecting the Head Editor.
  This mission is a cakewalk.

  The objective here is to place
  five pots on the five stumps.
  Do this by moving a unit next
  to a stump. The option should
  come up. However, the monsters
  in the area won't let you by
  too easily. They will prove to
  be quite irritating in this
  battle. I'd recommend sending
  in units with high move and
  speed stats for this battle.

  Do not worry about the
  Baknamies - they are far too
  slow to really be any threat
  in this mission. The other
  monsters, however, may cause
  problems. The Sprites will
  likely spam Meteorite often.
  They can also cast White Wind
  to heal allies, along with the
  Time Magick skill, Slow. If
  you don't feel like taking
  them down, you can Silence
  them to effectively prevent
  them from using any magick,
  thus forcing them to rely on
  physical attacks.

  The Wolves can use Fangs and
  nothing else. As for the
  Worgens, be wary of Chilling
  Blow and Fiery Blow. The
  former skill can Immobilize a
  group of units, whereas the
  latter skill can inflict
  Silence a group of units.
  Worgens are fairly strong, so
  you might find it more
  efficient to Disable or Addle
  them as opposed to killing
  them.

  Since your objective doesn't
  concern the monsters, do your
  best to get the urns on the
  stumps as quickly as possible.
  Place all five pots to finish
  this easy mission. Be careful
  though, for the monsters can
  steal the pots away if you
  leave them undefended. If that
  happens, you will need to
  replace the pot.

           - Thief x3
          - Viking x1
          - Soldier x1

  The law forbids you from
  getting robbed. That would
  prove to be an issue because
  you are up against three
  Thieves, a Viking capable of
  using Pickpocket to steal gil,
  and a Soldier with Mug Gil.
  Send in units that can inflict
  status ailments to prevent the
  enemy from being able to steal
  from you. That is imperative
  to the mission.

  The Hume Thief is capable of
  using Steal Gil, along with
  Focus and Leg Shot, which
  inflicts Immobilize. He also
  has Dual Wield set as a
  P-Ability, but his attack
  power is so low that it should
  not be a threat. As for the
  Moogle Thief at the top of the
  waterfall, be wary of Molotov
  Cocktail, which deals fire
  damage and can inflict
  Berserk, and Dagger Toss,
  which has a chance of
  inflicting Disable. The other
  Moogle Thief can use Moogle
  Knight abilities Moogle Attack
  and Moogle Rush.

  Be wary of the Viking and
  Soldier as well because they
  can steal gil from you. The
  Soldier can also use Provoke,
  which inflicts Berserk. The
  Viking can cast a weak Thunder
  spell that can deal almost
  negligible damage due to his
  low magick stats.

  From the start, start on
  preventing each of the enemy
  units from using any of their
  abilities. Disable, Addle,
  Sleep, etc. will work here.
  Anything that can prevent the
  enemy from stealing from you
  is perfectly viable here. Make
  sure that you do not get
  robbed or else the mission is
  lost. Alternatively, you can
  simply rely on ranged units to
  defeat the opposition from a
  distance or just knock out the
  enemy team before they can
  even act. A team of Assassins
  running around with Last
  Breath works, as always.

Greetings from the Bonga Bugle!
  This month we'll be taking a
  look at special places,
  traveling far and wide across
  Jylland to find the best and
  the most beautiful! And I'll
  need assistants!

  Go to the location in
  Moorabella to meet the Head
  Editor. He will interview you
  with a very controversial
  question. Choose the last
  option to satisfy him (all
  cool and collected applicants
  have to be able to smirk), and
  he'll dispatch you to the
  Ruins of Delgantua.
   Head over there right now.

  Forbidden:
      - Buffs

  Enemies:
        - White Mage x1
       - Elementalist x1
        - Green Mage x1
          - Sniper x1
         - Assassin x1

  As expected, the Head Editor
  manages to create trouble for
  everyone. This fight is
  against a team of Vieras, and
  you must protect the Head
  Editor in the process. Bring
  in six units for this
  engagement.

  The Assassin is the fastest
  unit on the enemy team - she
  has a very high speed stat, so
  it would certainly help to
  inflict Slow on her. Her
  abilities are particularly
  malicious: Shadowbind can
  inflict Stop, Nightmare
  inflicts Doom and Sleep, and
  Ague inflicts Slow. Unless you
  can effective Silence her or
  disable in some way, you will
  want to prioritize her first.

  Also try to take down the
  Sniper early on as well.
  Although she is not as fast as
  the Assassin, she can still be
  a huge threat with her Death
  Sickle (Doom status) ability.
  Beso Toxico inflicts poison
  damage, and Marksman's Spite
  deals damage equal to the
  user's lost HP. Marksman's
  Spite can be dangerous when
  she's in critical health, so
  try to eliminate her quickly
  without leaving her with low
  HP when
    her next turn comes up.

  Next, focus on the White Mage,
  who can heal her teammates by
  using Cure and Esuna. Her
  Turbo MP increases her healing
  power, but it also prevents
  her from using Cure every
  single turn (because Turbo MP
  doubles MP cost). Be careful
  around the Elementalist, whose
  various Elemental Magicks can
  inflict debuffs. Evil Gaze can
  induce Confuse status, Boulder
  Crush has a chance of
  inflicting Immobilize status,
  and Sliprain can induce Slow.
  Lastly, the Green Mage can use
  Blind, Silence, and Sleep.
  None of those are very
  dangerous debuffs, so consider
  leaving her for last.

  Most of the Viera here rely on
  MP to use their techniques.
  Therefore, casting Silence on
  them can help significantly by
  effectively disabling their
  ability to use magick.
  Remember, the Head Editor is
  the mission objective - he has
  to stay alive. Unfortunately,
  he is not the sharpest Seeq
  out there so he may run
  himself into trouble more
  often than you'd like. Keep an
  eye on him, making sure that
  no harm comes his way.

  This mission requires you to
  survey people on their New
  Year's resolution. There are
  people on the streets and in
  the houses, whom you can
  inquire by standing next to
  their doors. You will get a
  variety of answers, each of
  which can fit into a specific
  category. After talking to
  everyone in town, speak with
  the Head Editor and tell him
  what the most popular
  resolution was between making
  money, keeping healthy,
  pursuing hobbies, or working
  hard.

  You should be able to get it
  on your first try, assuming
  you actually listened to the
  townsfolk. If not, then try
  again next year (or keep
  reloading if you saved
  previously). Actually, you
  could probably pass by picking
  random answers (there are only

  them turns out to be right.
  The resolutions, as you
  might've expected, are

  Enemies:

       - Black Chocobo x1

  Here in Galerria Deep, you
  must survey the points of
  interest in the cavern. Your
  intrusion has disturbed some
  of the caverns residents
 though, so prepare for battle.

  The Zombies are undead,
  meaning they can't be
  completely eliminated without
  using a Phoenix Down, the
  Archer ability Burial, etc.
  The focus of the mission is
  not to take down all enemies
  though, rather it is to survey
  the area. The Zombies are
  capable of using Miasma to
  inflict Poison and Drain Touch
  to sap HP. They are also
  capable of casting Dark to
  heal themselves and the
  Ahrimans. Note that Zombies
  are particularly susceptible
  to holy-based attacks, so
  utilize that if you must.
  White Mage restorative
  abilities deal damage to them.

  The Ahrimans pose the biggest
  threat primarily because of
  Glare, which can turn a target
  into Stone, Demonic Gaze,
  which inflicts Confuse, and
  the ever popular Roulette,
  which selects a random unit in
  the battle to die. You can
  avoid getting afflicted by its
  gazes by simply not looking at
  the Ahriman. Roulette,
  unfortunately, relies mainly
  on luck. Try to rid the cavern
  of the Ahrimans first, using
  holy-based attacks for extra
  damage.

  Lastly, the Black Chocobo is
  not a factor at all. It can
  only use Choco Flame, which
  inflicts fire-based damage,
  and Choco Beak, a weak
  physical attack. Heed no
  attention to it unless you're
  looking to mount it with a
  Chocobo Knight.

  Inspect all of the shining
  dots in the cavern to draw
  this mission to a close.

  Deliver the Darklord Crystal
  to the Zedlei Consortium in
  the Zedlei Forest, and the
  Seeq will offer you 50 Gil.
  Tell him that that is nowhere
  near enough, and you will
  enter battle. Remember to heed
  the law! Every ability and
  weapon that you use must have
  an elemental affiliation. Send
  in units with ice andfire-
  based attacks preferably
   to deal with the monsters.

  You are up against a group of
  Seeqs accompanied by some
  flans. The monsters are all
  capable of casting their
  respective elemental magick,
  in addition to Acid, which
  inflicts a random status
  ailment, and Unction, which
  inflicts Oil status. These
  monsters are easily eliminated
  by taking advantage of their
  elemental weaknesses. The Ice
  Flan is weak to fire; the
  Yellow Jelly is weak to water,
  and the
Red Marshmallow is weak to ice.

  The two Rangers are more of a
  nuisance than anything. One of
  them can lay Silence Gas and
  Leech traps all over the
  place, and the other is
  capable of putting down Sten
  Needle (deals 1/2 total HP
  damage, minimum damage = 10
  HP) and Love Potion, which
  Charms the unfortunate unit
  that steps on it. Prioritize
  these two Seeqs first to
  prevent them from laying the
  entire battlefield with traps.

  Lastly, the Berserker is the
  primary damage output on the
  enemy team. Be wary of Smite
  of Rage, which deals
  devastating damage with a
  chance of inflicting a random
  status ailment. Scream dispels
  surrounding units. Since his
  HP is really high, you are
  better off just Disabling the
  Berserker while you work on
  the other enemies. To finish
  the mission, just defeat all
  foes. The Seeq will even pay
  you 5000 Gil, a more
  reasonable price.

  Enemies:

          - Wraith x1

  While searching for the
  trapped mine workers, your
  clan encounters a group of
  spirits. Units with holy-based
  attacks are recommended here.
  To make things easier, send in
  a unit with Archer ability
  Burial or White Monk ability
  Exorcise. If those are
  unavailable, then any
  character with Item command
  (to use Phoenix Downs) will
  suffice.

  All of the Ghosts can use
  Sleep Touch and Silence Touch,
  which induce Sleep and Silence
  obviously. A few of them can
  also attack with Flash, which
  has a chance of inflicting
  Blind status. Each Ghost has
  Blood Price set as their
  P-Ability - Blood Price causes
  spells to cost HP rather than
  MP. The Wraith is capable of
  using Wake the Dead, which
  summons more undead monsters,
  along with Darkga, a powerful
  dark-based magick spell that
  it can use to not only deal
  damage but also to heal itself
  and its allies.

  Focus on the Wraith first, for
  its Darkga spell is very
  powerful. Once it is down,
  begin eliminating the
  remaining Ghosts. Do your best
  to avoid getting afflicted the
  various status ailments.
  Remember, sleeping units can
  be woken up by attacking them.
  As soon as you take an undead
  monster, use Exorcise/Burial
  on the gravestone to banish it
  forever. Phoenix Down works
  the same way.

  Your objective is the gil
  snapper, am Adamantitan.
  Accompanying it are two
  Banshees and two Great
  Tortoises. It is not necessary
  to defeat the other monsters,
  but I would strongly suggest
  you eliminate the two
  Banshees, as they can use
  Petrifying Rattle to turn a
  target into stone. The Great
  Tortoises are more trouble
  than they're worth to defeat,
  but you will still want to be
  wary of Headbutt, which can
  inflict Immobilize status.
  Sonic Spin is an attack that
  damages surrounding units.

  When engaging the mark, be
  careful of Matra Magick, which
  switches the target's HP and
  MP. Early in the battle, when
  your MP is still low, this can
  devastate your units,
  especially your strong
  physical attackers who rely
  more on HP than your weaker
  spellcasters. Its other
  abilities are not very
  dangerous. It can use Sonic
  Spin and Rain of Stone, which
  inflicts earth-based damage on
  a group of units.

  The Adamantitan has extremely
  high defense stats, but its
  magick resistance stats are
  nothing remarkable. If
  possible, use spells to dish
  out more damage. However, make
  sure you heed the law, which
  expressly forbids fire, ice,
  and lightning-based attacks.
  The gil snapper is weak to
  wind-based attacks, so use
  those to expedite its death.

      - Red Marshmallow x1

  A picnic in the Nazan Mines,
  huh? It sounds like fun.
  Anyway, there are a few
  monsters here for you to
  eliminate. Send in six units
  for the battle and begin.

  Both the Headless monsters are
  capable of using Bone Shatter,
  which delays a target's next
  turn, Brute Strength, which
  raises the damage of its next
  attack, and Sunder Earth, an
  earth-based attack that deals
  damage in a line. Their speed
  is very low, meaning you can
  probably overpower them before
  they even get a chance to
  move. Be care though, for
  their attack is quite high. It
  would not be a bad idea to
  debuff them to prevent them
  from attacking. Use wind-based
  abilities to take these
  monsters down.

  The Grenade inflicts fire
  damage primarily. Its Flame
  Attack is a basic fire-based
  move that deals moderate
  damage. Spark can be an issue
  because it damages surrounding
  units and restores the
  Grenade's HP. Even so, the
  Grenade is fairly weak, and
  its speed is quite low.
  Grenades are weak to water-
  based attacks.

  The three flans are helped by
  the law, which forbids fire,
  ice, and lightning. Ergo, you
  can't use the flans' elemental
  weaknesses against them. The
  Red Marshmallow is capable of
  using Unction, in addition to
  Fire and Fira. Unction, which
  inflicts Oil status, may be
  dangerous because both the Red
  Marshmallow and the Grenade
  can use fire-based attacks.
  The remaining two flans are
  capable of using Acid, in
  addition to their respective
  Black Magick spells (Blizzard/
  Blizzara for Ice Flan,
  Thunder/Thundara for Yellow
  Jelly).

  Since you can't take advantage
  of elemental weaknesses, just
  use conventional means to
  eliminate the flans. Should
  you be affected by Oil status,
  quickly kill off the Grenade
  and Red Marshmallow to remove
  those threats. Other than
  that, the remainder of the
  battle should be fairly
  straightforward.

 E3-05 Shaved Ice ~

  I need someone to bring me an
  ice stone. You see, my
  daughter Coryn has taken ill,

  True, ice from places such as
  the Rupie Mountains would do,
  but I want only the best for
  my daughter.

  The objective in this mission
  is to gather up all of the
  licra ores in the mines. A
  number of undead monsters,
  however, have stepped in your
  way. Send in six units,
  preferably those with the
  ability to banish undead
  monsters (Archer's Burial,
  White Monk's Exorcise,
  Paladin's Sanctify).

  The Ghosts are capable of
  inflicting various status
  ailments through using Sleep
  Touch, Silence Touch, and
  Flash. In addition, Wake the
  Dead summons an undead
  monster. This ability is
  rarely used though, so don't
  worry about it. The Zombies
  and Ghoul can use Miasma,
  which has a chance of
  inflicting Poison status, and
  Drain Touch, which drains HP
  from the target to heal the
  user. The Ghoul has high
  attack, so you should deal him
  first.

  Remember, undead monsters are
  weak to holy-based attacks.
  Restorative spells damage them
  as well. In order to banish an
  undead monster for good, you
  must use Burial, Exorcise,
  Sanctify, or a Phoenix Down on
  it. To ensure 100% accuracy,
  do just that on the tombstone
  of any fallen undead.

  There is no need to defeat all
  of the monsters, though it's
  recommended that you at least
  eliminate the Ghosts to
  prevent them from putting your
  party to Sleep. You must
  examine all of the sparkling
  dots on the ground to complete

  Enemies:
          - Zombie x2
           - Ghoul x1
      - Great Tortoise x2
     - Entz (Alchemist) x1

  The cause of the falling
  meteors would be Entz, the
  Alchemist. For this battle,
  units with holy-based attacks
  are recommended. Also, bring
  in units that can banish
  undead (with abilities like
  Exorcise and Burial) if you
  want to facilitate the battle.

  Your main target is Entz. Feel
  free to eliminate his other
  monsters, but know that they
  are not the objective. The
  Great Tortoises, with their
  high attack stats, can be an
  issue. Headbutt deals damage
  with a chance of inflicting
  Immobilize status, Sonic Spin
  damages all units surrounding
  the Great Tortoise, and Limit
  Glove is a devastating attack
  that can only be used when the
  Great Tortoise is with single-
  digit HP. Killing the two
  Great Tortoises is optional,
  but you might just be better
  off inflicting Disable or
  putting them to Sleep.

  The Zombies are hardly a
  threat. They can use Miasma,
  which damages with a chance of
  inflicting Poison, and Drain
  Touch, which saps HP from the
  target. The Ghoul, on the
  other hand, is a much bigger
  threat. Its attack power is
  very high, and it can also
  cast Darkra to heal its undead
  comrades. Note that defeating
  these undead monsters does not
  put them down for good. If you
  leave their tombstone alone
  for too long, they will
  regenerate. Skills such as
  Burial and Exorcise can banish
  the tombstone permanently, so
  use them to oust the Zombies
  and Ghoul from the
  battlefield.

  Entz himself can cast only
  Protometeor, a powerful spell
  that sends a gigantic meteor
  crashing down on a group of
  units. If you can manage to
  Silence him or inflict a
  debuff that prevents him from
  casting spells, then he will
  pretty much cease to be a
  threat. Entz will fall quickly
  if you focus your attacks on
  him. Defeat him to get the
  mission done.

  Your party outnumbers the
  kidnappers, so this battle is
  relatively easy. Send in any
  six units, paying attention to
  the law (no Seeqs allowed),
  and initiate the battle.

  The Seer should be dealt with
  first because he is the
  weakest of the bunch. His
  spell library is laughable, so
  don't expect to face much
  resistance from him. His
  Magick Up ability does
  increase the damage output of
  his Fira spell, but it should
  not be a significant threat.
  He can also cast Esuna and use
  Magick Counter. As for the
  Blue Mage, you will want to be
  wary of Sandstorm, which can
  inflict Blind status on a
  group of units. Bad Breath has
  a chance of inducing Blind,
  Silence, and Poison status,
  and Unction can inflict Oil
  status. If possible, Addle or
  Disable him to effectively
  prevent him from using any of
  his techniques.

  The Archer can be a nuisance
  with his Leg Shot and Arm Shot
  abilities. The former can
  inflict Immobilize status and
  the latter can Disable. Other
  than that, he is not very
  dangerous - his attack stat is
  too low to really be a threat.
  Finally, the Ninja, in
  addition to Throw, is capable
  of casting Fire Veil, which
  deals light fire damage with a
  chance to Confuse, and Water
  Veil, which inflicts light
  water damage with a chance to
  Silence. He is not very tough,
  but his evade stat is fairly
  high.

  Overall, this is a very easy
  battle. None of your enemies
  are particularly difficult to
  defeat. Eliminate them all to
  save the girl. (Is it a girl?)

You can undergo Clan Trials to
attain better clan privileges
for battle, along with points
that go toward Negotiation,
Aptitude, Teamwork, and
Adaptability.

Clan Trials can be accessed
through the pub. Clan Points are
needed in lieu of gil. Each
trial has five levels, ranging
from Novices to Veterans.
Difficulty rises as you go up
the tiers, but rewards are much
better.

For a full listing of unlockable
clan privileges, consult its
respective section.

 * NOTE: YOU CANNOT SKIP CLAN
   PRIVILEGE LEVELS! This means
   you can't go
 from a privilege such as Power
 Up 1 to Power Up 5 within
 completion of one trial. If you
 attempt to do so, you will only
 level up to Power Up 2 from
 Power Up 1. You can therefore
 only progress clan privileges
 by increments of 1, though it
 is viable to get to Power Up 5
 by completing that trial
 repeatedly until the level is
 reached.

  Enemies:
          - Sprite x4

  Bring in five units, in
  addition to Luso, to face off
  against the four Sprites. The
  law is irritating since you
  have no control over whether
  or not you miss. My only
  suggestion would be to avoid
  using any abilities with
  accuracy less than 90%.

  The Sprites are annoying for a
  number of reasons. First of
  all, they are quite fast, so
  they'll be zipping around the
  battlefield causing trouble.
  Second, they all have the
  ability to cast Slow, which
  can be a huge nuisance against
  an already quick enemy team. I
  would recommend that you cast
  Silence on them, but due to
  the law, that might be an
  unnecessary risk (unless of
  course you have the
  Concentrate P-Ability or
  Assassin technique Tranq).

  Sprites are physically weak,
  so just go around with your
  units and knock them down. Be
  wary of Meteorite, which deals
  heavy damage.

  Reward: +8 Adaptability, +8

  This trial is essentially the

  Trial, with the addition of a
  single Sprite. Again, all
  Sprites are capable of casting
  Slow and Meteorite. Use the
  same strategy as the previous
  level.

  Reward: +12 Adaptability, +12

  The enemy force is comprised

  around. Again, same strategy
  should be applied as before.
  Focus on a single Sprite at a
  time to maximize efficiency.
  No one likes a barrage of
  meteorites after all.

  ~ Professional Trial ~

  Reward: +16 Adaptability, +16
  Teamwork, +16 Negotiation, +16
  Aptitude (Clan Privilege:
  Bonus CP 2)

  Enemies:
          - Sprite x6

  This time around, you will
  have to defeat all six of the
  Sprites within four rounds.
  That's not a particularly
  arduous task, especially
  considering how weak Sprites
  are. The Sprites retain the
  same abilities as the past
  levels. They will try to spam
  Slow in
    order to slow you down.

  No complex strategies are
  required for this battle.
  Using a Power Up clan
  privilege should help defeat
  the Sprites faster. Just use
  your strongest units and
  strike all of them down.
  Recall that attacks from the
  rear deal the most amount of
  damage. Also take advantage of
  spells that deal damage over
  an area. The Sprites will
  often group together, giving
  you ample opportunity to blast
  them with Black Magick or
  similar abilities.

  Three rounds may prove to be
  an issue if you don't have a
  very strong party. Powerful
  units, preferably those with
  high move stats, are
  recommended. Use the strongest
  abilities available to you and
  you should be able to finish
  the mission in well under
  three rounds.

  Alternatively, you can bring
  in a powerhouse team and just
  cast Berserk on everyone.
  Sprites are frail little
  creatures, so they'll fall
  pretty quickly.

  (Clan Privilege: Move Up 1)

  Enemies:
      - Zaghnal x1 (1 spawn end
        of third round)

  Your opponent is a Zaghnal
  here, a more powerful version
  of the common Werewolf. The
  law for this fight forbids
  damage over 20 HP, which is
  ridiculous. You can't possibly
  win without dealing over 20 HP
  damage per unit. If you're
  really anal about the law,
  send in a unit who can Doom or
  KO instantly (Last Breath,
  anyone?).

  The Zaghnal is capable of
  using Roar, which removes all
  buffs, Slug, an attack that
  ignores defense, and Assault,
  an attack with a chance of
  inflicting Immobilize status.
  Its attack power is very high,
  so consider casting Protect on
  your party to help raise
  defense a bit. If possible,
  use wind-based attacks because
  the Zaghnal has a weakness to
  wind.

  Reinforcements will spawn on
  the third round, so it's very
  important that you kill this
  first Zaghnal before the next
  monster arrives. If you do,
  then the trial will end before
  it can even appear!

      - Zaghnal x1 (2 spawn end
        of third round)

  Bring in six of your strongest
  units for this fight. Again,
  you are up against one
  Zaghnal. It's imperative that
  you take it down before the
  third round to avoid having to
  face two more monsters. It's
  very difficult to kill two
  reinforcements in a single
  turn (you have to complete the
  trial within four rounds).

  If you have any instant death
  abilities, now would be a
  great time to use them. As
  long as the first Zaghnal is
  dead before the other two
  arrive, the trial will be a
  success.

  ~ Hero Trial ~

  Reward: +32 Adaptability, +32

    Aptitude, Quest Fees -12%,

   (Clan Privilege: Regenga)

  Enemies:
      - Zaghnal x1 (3 spawn end
        of second round)

  The reinforcements will arrive
  on the second round this time,
  so you must kill the first
  Zaghnal IMMEDIATELY. If not,
  then you'll have to contend
  with a very difficult fight.
  The round limit is still four,
  so you wouldn't have much time
  to kill off the remaining
  monsters
 should they manage to come in.

  Once again, instant death
  abilities are great for this
  battle. To further increase
  your damage output prior to
  the second round, consider
  using Smile Toss, Quicken, or
  similar abilities to give your
  heaviest hitters a second
  chance at striking the Zaghnal
  for more damage.

  Use the same strategy as the
  previous trials. The only
  difference here is the three
  round limit, and the fact that
  two reinforcements will spawn
  during the second round. You
  are still up against the same
  Zaghnal, so hit it with all
  you've got!

  Once again, utilize the same
  strategy. Don't allow the
  Zaghnal to survive into the
  second round to avoid facing
  the three reinforcements. The
  round limit is three again,
  but that should not be an
  issue at all if you can finish
  it in two.

    (Clan Privilege: Empowered

  Enemies:
         - Dreamhare x2

  Targeting distant units is
  illegal here, meaning any
  attack that affects a target
  two or more units away is
  ground for failure. This also
  includes attacks that knock
  back, meaning critical hits
  count as breaking the law!
  This can be avoided by having
  another unit block the enemy,
  preventing them from being
  pushed back in the event that
  you do land an unlucky
  critical hit.

  This first battle pits you
  against two Dreamhares. Send
  in any six units and start the
  battle. Dreamhares are weak
  monsters, so their defense is
  nothing to really worry about.
  Their abilities include War
  Dance, which raises attack,
  Hip Attack, and Illude, which
  can inflict Charm. Illude will
  prove to be the biggest issue
  here. You can quickly
  eliminate Charm status by
  attacking the affected unit.

  Finish the mission as quickly
  as possible by swarming the
  Dreamhares with your strongest
  units. Their defense stat, as
  stated before, is laughable.
  It should not take long to
  defeat these monsters, no
   matter what level you are.

  ~ Intermediary Trial ~

  Reward: +6 Negotiation, -4

  A third Dreamhare is added to
  the fray. Other than that,
  this battle differs little
  from the previous ranking. The
  Dreamhares retain all previous
  abilities. Watch out for
  Illude. Should any of your
  units get Charmed, attack the
  affected unit to knock him/her
  out of it.

  ~ Barterer Trial ~

  Reward: +9 Negotiation, -5
  Aptitude, Quest Fees -3%, Item

    (Clan Privilege: Luck 2)

  Enemies:
         - Dreamhare x4

  The enemy team consists of
  four Dreamhares this time
  around. Use the same strategy
  you've been using before,
  being careful not to
  accidentally break the law by
  inflicting a critical hit. I
  haven't mentioned it yet, but
  Dreamhares do have a weakness
  to fire-based attacks. Make
  the battle go by more quickly
  by taking advantage of this
  weakness. Still, bear in mind
  that you cannot attack distant
  units! Don't let that slip.

  Charm status may be an issue,
  so any equipment resistant to
  that status would be useful
  here. Again, the easiest way
  to knock an affected unit out
  of Charm is by attacking
  him/her.

  ~ Broker Trial ~

  Reward: +12 Negotiation, -6
  Aptitude, Quest Fees -4%, Item
  Prices -4%

  Enemies:
         - Dreamhare x5

  Your objective here is to
  defeat all five Dreamhares
  within four turns. This is not
  a tough objective. The trial
  can be facilitated by using
  Black Mages and other jobs
  with fire-based attacks.
  Dreamhares are weak to fire-
  based attacks. Again, heed the
  law, which forbids targeting
  anything more than one tile
  away!

  Equipment resistant to Charm
  status helps tremendously
  here. Don't allow any of your
  units to remain in Charm
  status for they can
  potentially break the law
  (plus it's a pain having your
  own unit attacking your
  characters).

  This final bout may prove to
  be difficult. In order to
  finish it in time, you should
  utilize fire-based attacks as
  much as possible. Dreamhares
  don't have much HP, so you
  should be able to drop two of
  them per turn.

  For these follow trials, it's
  recommended that you save
  before the trial so you can
  quickly retry it in the event
  that you fail.

  In order to successfully
  complete this trial, you must
  find the winning barrel in
  three rounds. The follow
  trials mostly rely on luck,
  since there's no clear
  indication as to which barrel
  is the winning barrel.

  You can send in three units.
  This isn't a difficult trial
  because you have three whole
  rounds to find the right
  barrel. At the start, assign a
  single barrel to each unit. In
  the unlikely event that those
  three aren't the winning
  barrels, quickly inspect the
  last barrel.

  Honestly, if you can't finish
  this first level trial, then
  there's
   something wrong with you.

  There are four barrels this

  is four rounds. The four
  barrels are scattered at the
  corners of the forest, so you
  will need units with high move
  stats.

  Again, assign one barrel to
  each of your three units. Go
  straight for the one at the
  lower-left, lower-right, and
  upper-right corners. If none
  of those three work, then
  check the other barrel at the
  upper-right corner using the
  closest unit.

  Six barrels dot the woods this

  them are in fairly close
  proximity to your starting
  position. Send in three units
  move stats of at least 4, and
  start the trial. Assign each
  of your units the two closest
  barrels to his/her starting
  position. Since there are more
  barrels this time, make sure
  that you keep track of which
  barrels you've already
  examined.

  You have plenty of time for

  it should
    not be difficult at all.

  An adequate move stat (at

  have four rounds to find the
  winning barrel.

  The two barrels furthest to
  the left should be dealt with
  by one unit. The two barrels
  nearest the lower-right corner
  should also be assigned to one
  unit. Lastly, assign the
  remaining two barrels to the
  upper-right to one unit.

  The barrels in this trial are
  scattered in a similar fashion
  to the Technicial Trial.
  However, this time you only
  have two rounds to complete
  it, a really short time.

  High move stats are mandatory
  here. However, unless you are
  completing this trial late in
  the game, I doubt you have
  Ninja Tabis or Move Up clan
  privileges to make this trial
  easier.

  If you are attempting this
  early on, it's really just
  trial and error. It's
  impossible to reach every
  barrel when every one of your
  units only has a move stat of
  4. Just make sure you save
  beforehand and reload if you
  don't get lucky.

  Enemies:
           - Mimic x2

  First of all, a little
  clarification on the law. All
  of your abilities that you use
  MUST consume MP. This has been
  the subject of some concern to
  many players. For that reason,
  bring in mage characters and
  other units who can use MP.
  Standard attack commands are
  still allowed.

  This first fight is
  ridiculously easy. The Mimics
  are weak to every element,
  meaning you can't go wrong
  with any spell really. Their
  abilities compose of Rock,
  which restores HP, and
  Scissors, which deal lightning
  damage to an area - it's a
  similar spell to the Black
  Magick spell, Thunder.

  There is no way you can really
  go wrong here. Defeat both of
  the Mimics, making sure that
  you use MP with every ability,
  to finish the mission.

  ~ Associate Trial ~

  Reward: +7 Teamwork, -4

  Enemies:
           - Mimic x3

  Your enemy this time around
  consists of three Mimics. They
  still retain the same
  abilities as the previous
  level trial, so there is
  nothing to worry about. Bring
  in some powerful spellcasters
  to take down the monsters.
  Again, recall that any ability
  that does not use MP is
  forbidden. Fight commands are
  still allowed.

  not use abilities that do not
  consume MP. Fight commands, as
  before, are still valid.

  ~ Confidante Trial ~

  Reward: +13 Teamwork, -6
  Adaptability

  Enemies:
           - Mimic x5

  For this trial, you need to
  slay the five Mimics within
  the course of four rounds.
  This is not a hard task,
  considering how weak these
  monsters are. When the Mimics
  group together, you can easily
  deal deadly damage by casting
  spells that damage an area.
  Keep a sharp eye out for
  opportunities such as those to
  expedite the process. Clocking
  in under the round limit
  should not be difficult at
  all.

  Do not use abilities that do
  not consume MP. Standard fight
  commands
   are viable options though.

  The Mimic count has been upped
  to six and the round limit has
  been decreased to three this
  time around. Send in your most
  powerful spellcasters for this
  mission. Since the
  battleground is so small, use
  spells that deal damage over
  an area to inflict some heavy
  numbers. Though the round
  limit is pretty easy to beat,
  don't lose track of time.

  Again, abilities that do not
  consume are not allowed.
  However, fight commands are
  legal.

  Enemies:
      - Red Marshmallow x1

  The objective for this trial
  is to drive off the Red
  Marshmallow. However, you
  cannot utilize conventional
  attacks because of the law.
  The proper way to do this is
  to note the monster's
  expression. It will perform
  one of three possible actions,
  each of which corresponds to a
  different option:

   + Turns around once and jumps
     --> Threaten
   + Lean backwards repeatedly
     --> Surprise
   + Twirls around repeatedly
     --> Stare Down

  When you get up next to the
  Red Marshmallow, an Experiment
  option will show up. Select
  the action according to the
  action of the Red Marshmallow.
  Get it right, and the enemy
  will turn tail and run.

  You have four rounds to
  complete this objective. If
  you really can't get it in
  three rounds, consider playing
  a different game...

  This time around, you have to
  drive off TWO Red Marshmallows
  (because God forbid it gets
  more difficult!) within the
  course of four rounds. All
  options remain the same. You
  can only focus on one Red
  Marshmallow at a time, so
  don't mess it up. The other
  Red Marshmallow can
  potentially use Acid on your
  party. This ability inflicts a
  random status ailment. Even if
  one of your units is hindered,
  you can still rely on your
  other party members, hence the
  reason you can bring in more
  (and should have) than one
  unit.

  this trial would be even

  Enemies:
         - Tonberry x2

  Unfortunately, the law seems
  to be against spellcasters in
  general. This first level of
  the trial pits you against two
  Tonberrion. These monsters are
  quite deadly. You'll do well
  to bring in units with
 Items as their second ability.

  The Tonberrion have three
  abilities you'll want to be
  especially careful around.
  Knife reduces HP by 90% and
  Butcher's Knife reduces HP to
  1. Wow, you really can't argue
  with those numbers. Karma is
  dangerous as well - it has the
  potential to deal 999 HP
  damage! Stalk just makes the
  Tonberry to follow a selected
  target until it gets close
  enough to strike. Though,
  oftentimes, the Tonberry
  breaks off from stalking to
  attack a more conveniently
  placed unit.

  You will want to debuff the
  Tonberrion to prevent them
  from using their abilities.
  Addle does the job just fine,
  as do Disable, Sleep, and
  Stop. You can even Berserk
  them to force them to use
  standard attacks. Ranged units
  are effective here because the
  Tonberrion do not have very
  high move stats. If you can
  stay out of their range, then
  you can shoot at the
  Tonberrion without fear.

  If you have a Blue Mage in
  your party with the Cornered
  ability, you should allow the
  Tonberrion to use Butcher's
  Knife on him. Then, unleash
  Cornered for a nice 999 HP
  damage attack! Heal and repeat
  -
 it's really a great strategy.

  Complete this trial in four
  rounds to successfully finish
  it.

  Three Tonberrion make up the
  enemy force this time. Again,
  exercise caution when
  approaching the Tonberrion.
  Their movement stat is very
  low, so they won't be able to
  reach you if you maintain
  distance. Inflict debuffs to
  disable the other Tonberrion
  as you focus on your target.

  The Blue Mage Cornered skill
  is still viable, but take
  caution not to let another
  Tonberry finish off your Blue
  Mage in case his turn doesn't
  come up directly after getting
  stabbed.

  Finish the trial in four
  rounds to successfully

  There are three Tonberrion
  this time, and the round limit
  is three. To expedite the
  process of killing off these
  monstrosities, don't try to
  inflict any debuffs this time
  around. Instead, just throw
  your strongest units at the
  Tonberrion and tear them
  apart.

  It's a reckless strategy, but
  it's guaranteed to win you the
  trial, unless of course your
  units are THAT weak.
  Tonberrion aren't fast and the
  most each individual one can
  possibly kill in one turn is
  just one unit, so you should
  have enough surviving fighters
  to overpower them.

  battle. You should send in
  units that can kill Tonberry
  within two strikes (although a
  one-hit kill is always best).

  Again, send your physical
  units straight for the
  Tonberrion. This needs to be a
  quick battle. Spend the first
  turn approaching the
  Tonberrion. Then, have all of
  your units unleash on the
  monsters in the second round.

  Enemies:
        - Cockatrice x4

  The idea here is to defend
  your party from the monsters.
  In this first round, the enemy
  levels range from 23-28. Send
  in six units accordingly. You
  can choose to either defend
  your party without attacking
  or fight the Cockatrices. Note
  the law though! You cannot
  harm a unit with a lower level
  than you.

  This first battle isn't tough
  at all. The Cockatrices can
  only use Peck, which deals
  moderate damage. Cast Protect
  if you want to boost defenses.

  addition to the level 23 and
  level 28 Cockatrices, there
  are now two more level 30
  Cockatrices. Deal with them

  This trial is a huge pain
  because the round limit is so
  long. The Cockatrices are
  still the same as the previous
  trial. Again, outwait them or
  go for the Cockatrices that
  are at a higher level than
  your units. Do not attack
  Cockatrices at a lower level
  unless you want to fail. Wait
  three rounds to complete this
  trial.

  The only difference here from
  the previous trial level is
  the noticeably higher level of
  the Cockatrices. They also
  gain a new ability, Scatter,
  which deals damage to
  surrounding units and raises
  the user's evasion.

  If your units are at a lower
  level than these Cockatrices,
  feel free to fight back. If
  you need a defensive boost,
  consider casting Protect on
  your party. Survive three
  rounds against them to finish
  the trial.

  Six Cockatrices appear. The
  upper bound of the enemy in
  terms of levels is 40. If the
  levels of your units do not
  exceed that, then feel free to
  fight back. If not, then
  you'll just have to survive by
  hanging around until the round
  limit is up. Once three rounds
  are
    up, the trial will end.

  The magick urn will appear in
  different locations every time
  you examine, so you should
  bring in units with high move
  stats. Also send in a few
  units to contend with the
  Ahrimans at the top of the
  cliff.

  Ideally, you'll want to
  position one unit at each of
  the four corners of the map.
  Send the remaining two units
  (who should be physically
  strong) to deal with the
  Ahrimans. These monsters are
  annoying because they can use
  Demonic Gaze to Confuse your
  units and Bewitching Gaze to
  Charm and Slow your units.
  Both these abilities can be
  avoided by not facing the
  Ahrimans. Roulette,
  unfortunately, is impossible
  to avoid. Just hope it doesn't
  pick one of your units to die.

  Move stats are a huge factor
  here. You need to be able to
  quickly run to the pot
  wherever it spawns. Examine
  the urn four times before the
  four-round limit is over to
  finish this trial.

  Again, high move stats are
  necessary. Try to debuff the
  Ahrimans to prevent them from
  using any of their malicious
  abilities while you're chasing
  after the urn.

  I find that Faerie Shoes and
  Galmia Shoes help
  significantly here because
  they ignore height, which

  is now to examine the same
  magick urn six times within
  four rounds! This trial will
  require more careful
  distribution of your
  characters over the map to
  make sure you can reach the
  urn wherever it goes.

  There is still room for error,
  but you can't waste time. The
  Ahrimans are going to cause
  problems, but don't go out of
  your way to attack them. Just
  remember to face away from
  them to avoid getting affected
  by Demonic Gaze or Bewitching
  Gaze.

  Examine the urn six times to

  The magick urn must now be

  are absolutely mandatory here.
  You should bring at least unit
  specifically for debuffing the
  five Ahrimans perched at the
  top of the cliff.

  There is no time to waste -
  immediately get your four
  units with the highest move
  stats to each quarter section
  of the area. Send the
  remaining two towards the
  Ahrimans while maintaining a
  position roughly in the middle
  of the region. Do your best to
  debuff the Ahrimans as to
  prevent them from using any of
  their gazes and especially
  Roulette.

  Once the Ahriman's have been
  effectively disabled, chase
  the urn as it warps around the
  map. You need to examine it at
  least 2-3 times per turn in
  order to meet the objective.
  Unfortunately, you won't get
  lucky sometimes. Ninja Tabis
  (or the less effective Sprint
  Shoes), Galmia Shoes, Faerie
  Shoes, and the Move Up clan
  privileges help tremendously
  here! Also, use Haste and

  This trial requires you to

  same strategy as the previous
  trials and follow the same
  process as the Hand of
  Divinity Trial. Remember,
  Haste and Quicken can be
  extremely useful. Use Haste on
  all of your units, but don't
  abuse Quicken or else you may
  bring the end of the round
  faster.

  Don't waste any time trying to
  attack the Ahrimans. Disable
  them, put them to sleep, Stop
  them, do anything to prevent
  them from using any of their
  abilities. Roulette can be
  devastating here, especially
  in a situation where your last
  unit is about to touch the urn
  only to be knocked out with an
  unlucky Roulette.

  In this trial, you must gather

  catch though - as soon as you
  get a light, the remaining
  lights will move to another
  location. They will also move
  at the end of each round.
  Therefore, you should bring in
  units with high speed and move
  stats to most effectively
  capture all the lights.

  Your opposition comes in the
  form of three Red
  Marshmallows. These monsters
  are capable of casting
  Fire/Fira. They'll often use
  Unction to raise your
  vulnerability to fire.
  However, you should avoid
  getting too caught up in
  fighting the monsters and
  instead focus on reaching the
  lights.

  There are three lights in all
  that you need to reach. Get

  will need units with high move

  high speed as well.

  The newcomer, the Ice Flan,
  can use Acid to inflict a

  Although you should not focus
  all of your efforts on the
  enemy monsters, try to prevent
  the Ice Flan from causing too
  much trouble. This can be
  achieved through Disabling
  them, putting them to sleep,
  etc.

  The primary focus is still on
  the shimmering lights.
  Position each of your units in

  around so they'll be prepared
  when the lights change
  locations. Gather up the three

  lights within the course of
  four rounds. A Yellow Jelly
  has been added to the enemy
  party. It, like the Ice Flan,
  can use Acid to inflict a
  random debuff.

  In order to most efficiently
  finish this trial, you should
  distribute your units with the
  highest move stats over each
  quarter section of the area.
  This is the most efficient
  method because each unit can
  reach a shimmering light
  within his/her section without
  having to take extra turns.

  Use Haste and/or Quicken to
  speed up the process. Once the
  four lights have been
  collected, the trial will end.

  ~ Voyager Trial ~

  Reward: +25 Aptitude, +23
  Adaptability, -10 Negotiation,
  -6 Teamwork,
Quest Fees -3%, Item Prices -3%
    (Clan Privilege: Smash Gauge
    Bonus 3)

  Enemies:
      - Red Marshmallow x1
         - Ice Flan x1
       - Yellow Jelly x2

  Surprise! You now have to
  collect the four lights within
  three rounds. Once again,
  movement is very important
  here. Send in units with the
  adequate move stats and begin.

  Don't bother going after any
  of the monsters. Doing so will
  just waste precious time. Cast
  Haste on your units to speed
  them up, and distribute your
  units with the highest move
  stats over the region, making
  sure that they're scattered
  about. It should not be that
  difficult to collect the four
  lights within the round limit.

   ~ Master Explorer Trial ~

  Reward: +31 Aptitude, +29
  Adaptability, -12 Negotiation,
  -8 Teamwork,
Quest Fees -5%, Item Prices -5%
(Clan Privilege: MP Channeling)

  Enemies:
      - Red Marshmallow x1
         - Ice Flan x2
       - Yellow Jelly x2

  You now have to gather five
  lights within three turns. You
  also have to contend with a
  Red Marshmallow, two Ice
  Flans, and two Yellow Jellies.
  At this point, I can't really
  say much else than what I've
  already stated previously
  without sounding like a broken
  record.

  High move stats help a lot in
  this trial. Use Haste to help
  expedite the whole process of
  collecting lights. And unless
  the monsters really get in the
  way, ignore them. This trial
  can be slightly challenging,
  but it's nothing compared to
  the Master Hand Trial of
  Teamwork-Aptitude. Ugh, I get
  shudders just thinking about
  that.

12. Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[12000]~| |
|_|=============================

Final Fantasy Tactics A2
features two new features that
were not present in the original
FFTA. The bazaar and the auction
house are both new additions.

()------------------------------
||                              
()------------------------------

The bazaar has a pretty simple
function. After finishing
battles, your clan will pick up
various pieces of loot. This
loot can subsequently be traded
at the bazaar in exchange for
unique arms and armor. When
unlocked, these new items become
available for purchase at the
shop.

More valuable loot leads to more
valuable equipment. Under every
bazaar category are letters
ranging from A-E. A is the most
valuable category, and the loot
that is required is typically
harder to come by than say, a
piece of loot rated D.

Different categories unlock
different pieces of equipment.
You can tell what can be
unlocked by checking the grade
on the bazaar screen. Next to
each category is a run-down of
the letters A-E. Wherever there
is a circle indicates that there
is a piece of equipment
available for that letter. An
'X', on the other hand,
indicates that there is no
unlockable equipment for that
particular letter.

 * NOTE: Certain items, when
   unlocked at the Bazaar, can
   only be purchased
 ONCE (in order to purchase
 again, you will have to re-
 acquire the loot and unlock the
 item in the Bazaar). These
 particular items will be marked
 with an asterisk.

|| 12.2. The Auction House
[12200] ||
()------------------------------

The Auction House is unlocked
after completion of the Now
That's a Fire! mission.


         --- Basics ---


Auctions occur during one month
in every year. At first, you
will bid for regions, but once
you become Champion for Life,
you can bid for items. Many
pieces of rare equipment can be
attained very early in the game
through the use of auctions, so
it's in your best interest to
learn and master this aspect of
the game.

During each auction, you face
off against other rival clans.
The entry fee is 20 CP (your
first auction's fee will be
waived though) At the beginning,
you will be given a set amount
of 1-point coins, 2-point coins,
and 3-point coins. 5-point coins
typically are acquired as a
bonus.

The idea is pretty simple. Place
down the most amount of coins in
each auction to win. However,
you can't just put down all of
your highest coins. Doing so
would severely shorthand your
clan the next round. Rather, you
need to strategically put down
coins as to win each round of
the auction, yet still have
enough coins for the remaining
areas. The winner is always the
clan with the greatest amount of
points. However, it does not
matter if the winner beats out
the opposition by just one point
or 20 points. Therefore, strict
distribution of coins is
instrumental to victory.

In the event of a tie, the
region master is given the win.
If there is a tie between two
clans, neither of which is
region master, then the winner
is selected randomly. The first
clan to reach 30 points
automatically wins the auction.

Notice the timeline on the
bottom of the auction screen.
The bar will slowly fill as the
auction progresses. Bids are put
down at each of the notches in
the bar. Make sure you input
your command prior to each notch
or else you'll miss the
opportunity to put down coins
for that turn. Occasionally, a
'Bonus' box will pop up in one
of the notches. At this point in
the timeline, if your clan is in
the designated position in the
Bonus Box (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.),
your clan will receive a bonus
5-point token.

Upon gaining control of a
region, all quest fees and item
prices there will be reduced.
Not a bad deal, don't you think?

After completing 20 auctions,
the Token Emporium will be
unlocked. Here, you can purchase
tokens for the coming auctions.
At this point, you can
essentially stock up on 5-point
coins and blow away the
competition. The prices are as
follows:

 1-Point Coin: 5 CP
 2-Point Coin: 10 CP
 3-Point Coin: 20 CP
 5-Point Coin: 70 CP

Once you gain control of all
regions in an auction, you will
become Champion for Life,
meaning all regions in the area
are under your control
permanently (kind of defeats the
purpose of auctions now, doesn't
it?). At this point, you can bid
for items instead of regions in
the auctions to follow. Grand
prizes are attained by winning
all of the areas of a region in
one auction.


        --- Strategy ---


The key is to read the
opponent's motives. Their next
action can be determined by the
sprite's animation:

   Thought Bubble --> Not
   decided yet Shaking Head -->
   Not bidding Standing -->
   1-point coin Walking -->
   2-point coin Defense Pose -->
   3-point coin "!" Bubble Over
   Head --> 5-point coin

The quick pace of the auction
may be nerve-wracking at first,
but over time, you should get a
sense of what to expect from
enemy clans. Their gestures
should become engrained your
mind, so you can quickly make
decisions that'll put you over
the top.

The best strategy to use, after
you've memorized the enemy
clans' gestures and their
corresponding is to be ONE point
ahead of the others. Start off
each auction following the
actions of the other clans. As
soon as one clan appears to
emerge as the leading clan, bid
enough coins to get just ONE
point ahead of first place. Once
you are one point ahead of the
second-leading clan, just mirror
that particular clan's actions
so you always remain just one
point ahead of them. This
strategy works to conserve your
coins for the other rounds.
