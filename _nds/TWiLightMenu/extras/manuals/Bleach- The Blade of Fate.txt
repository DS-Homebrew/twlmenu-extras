└-------------------------------

This FAQ is meant to serve as a
translation and gameplay guide
for Treasure and Sega's Bleach
DS: Souten ni Kakeru Unmei. It
follows a rough outline of the
game's instruction manual with
more in-depth information for
items that non-Japanese players
would find most useful (such as
detailed information regarding
the card system and
Story/Challenge Mode
walkthroughs).

This guide will not include
either a story translation or
detailed character strategy. The
former is because I have very
limited Japanese skills and have
had no exposure to Bleach prior
to this game. The latter is
because I do not intend to learn
the ins-and-outs of every single
character.

This document is encoded in
Japanese Shift-JIS format. In
order to properly display
Japanese characters in your
browser, you must set its
character encoding to Shift-JIS.
In Internet Explorer and
Firefox, this should be located
somewhere in the View menu. If
you cannot find a selection for
Japanese Shift-JIS, you may have
to download a language pack.

If you believe you can supply
any additional useful
information or if you find a
mistake in this document that
needs to be corrected, feel free
to e-mail me.

- TOP SCREEN -

SOUL (魂魄) GAUGE This is the blue
life bar at the top of the
screen.

REIATSU (霊圧) GAUGE Can be
roughly translated as "spirit
pressure." This is the green bar
beneath your life gauge, which
fills up as you attack your
enemy and increases your reiatsu
stock count by 1 when filled.

REIATSU (霊圧) STOCK This is the
number located next to your life
gauge. You can hold up to 3
reiatsu stock in reserves, which
are required to perform super
moves and damage cancels.

REIFU (霊符) EFFECT Reifu are the
spirit cards used during battle
to power-up your character or
power-down your opponents. A
colored icon will appear beneath
your life gauge when your
character is currently under the
effect of a card. This color
indicates the type of effect,
which matches the color of the
card used. For more information
on reifu and their effects, see
the reifu section below.

REIRYOKU (霊力) GAUGE Can be
roughly translated as "spirit
power." This is the three-
segmented bar at the bottom of
the screen, which fills up
automatically over time.
Reiryoku is required to perform
RF specials, use flash steps,
and jump between the two planes
of battle. Using flash steps and
switching planes depletes the
inner gauge only, while using RF
specials depletes both the inner
and outer gauges. The inner
gauge restores itself more
quickly than the outer gauge,
but the inner gauge will only
restore itself as long as the
outer gauge is at an equal or
greater level. In other words,
the inner gauge can never be
larger than the outer gauge.

TIME LIMIT Located on the
bottom-right corner of the
screen.

- TOUCH SCREEN -

REIFU (霊符) STOCK Large number
that indicates how many reifu
you have left in reserves.

CHANGE BUTTON Pressing this
button changes the display
layout on the touch screen. You
can choose to either have only
two large reifu buttons on the
screen, or two smaller reifu
buttons accompanied by hotkeys
for special techniques.

REIFU (霊符) BUTTONS These are the
spirit cards, which are
activated upon touch. Ten of
these cards are randomly
selected from a preset deck and
shuffled. Two of them will be
available for use at any one
time.
 CARD EFFECT: The large Japanese
 text on the card indicates its
 effect. Check
   the reifu section below for
   an explanation of each card.
 CARD TARGET: This indicates who
 will be effected by the card,
 either your
   character (myself), all
   enemies, a single enemy, or
   all players.
 CARD LEVEL: This indicates the
 strength of that particular
 card. Most reifu
   have four levels of strength,
   level 1 being the weakest.
 CARD TIMER: Depending on the
 type of card, this indicates
 either how long the
   reifu effect will last or how
   long a used reifu card will
   continue to use up space on
   your screen before being
   replaced by a fresh one.

SPECIAL HOTKEYS Press the change
button to toggle these on and
off. Blue hotkeys are shortcuts
for specials and will always use
the reinforce (RF) version of
the attack when possible, next-
strongest version if not. Red
hotkeys are shortcuts for
supers.

You can select from either
DEATHMATCH or POINTMATCH in most

gameplay stops when your life
bar empties, and the last player
or team with any life remaining
wins. In Pointmatch, you receive
1 point for every hit point of
damage you inflict on the enemy
and lose 1 point for every hit
point you lose. Point matches
are always timed, and the player
or team with the most points at
the end of the battle wins.

- MOVEMENT -

WALK & TURN: left/right JUMP: up
CROUCH: down DASH: left/right
twice; 2nd press can be held
down AERIAL DASH: left/right
twice in mid-air DOUBLE JUMP: up
while in mid-air FLASH STEP: B
button (can be changed in
options, uses 1/3 of reiryoku
gauge) LINE CHANGE: L button
(can be changed in options, uses
1/3 of reiryoku gauge)

Movement in Bleach DS takes
place on two individual 2D
fighting planes (with the
exception of Area 10, which only
has one plane). Attacks
performed on one plane will not
interfere with the action on the
other plane, save for a handful
of special moves which either
launch a projectile into the
opposite plane or teleport your
character between planes. You
can switch planes at any time by
pressing the line change button,
which uses up one segment of
your inner reiryoku gauge.

Flash steps are used to quickly
teleport in any direction, and
most characters are invulnerable
and invisible to opponents when
they perform this technique. You
can use flash steps to teleport
through or away from enemy
attacks, travel a longer
distance quickly, link normal
attacks that normally do not
chain together, or position
yourself in the air for a quick
overhead attack. Flash steps
also use up one segment of your
inner reiryoku gauge.

A walking state can be canceled
into a dashing state, which can
then be canceled into an
attacking state. You can not
change between these states in
the opposite order (without the
use of a flash step). Up to one
double jump and two aerial
dashes can be performed before
returning to the ground. These
aerial movement techniques can
be linked together in any
manner. Walking speed, dashing
speed, and flash step distance
vary between individual
characters.

- DEFENSE -

GUARD: R button (can be changed
in options) GUARD CANCEL: flash
step / special while guarding
(uses reiryoku) DAMAGE CANCEL:
any attack button + flash step
when enemy strikes (uses
reiatsu)

Guarding nullifies damage from
enemy attacks and also prevents
you from being staggered. Most
special moves still inflict a
small amount of chip damage to
guarding opponents, however. A
standing guard blocks standing
and aerial attacks but is
vulnerable to crouching attacks
and throws. A crouching guard
blocks standing and crouching
attacks but is vulnerable to
aerial attacks and throws. An
aerial guard blocks all attacks.
Guarding can either be performed
with the guard button or by
moving in the opposite direction
of an enemy attack.

In a normal guarding state, you
can not perform any action
besides standing/crouching. When
an enemy attack hits your
character while you are
guarding, however, a small blue
circle will quickly appear,
expand, and vanish. While this
circle is visible, you can
perform either a flash step or a
special/super attack while you
are guarding. This technique is
called a guard cancel, and it
uses up one segment of your
inner reiryoku gauge.

A damage cancel can be performed
to break free from normal enemy
attacks, special moves, and
stuns. To perform this
technique, simultaneously press
the flash step button plus any
normal attack button while your
character is being attacked.
(Using a reifu while in a
damaged state also performs a
damage cancel.) The aura that
surrounds your character during
a damage cancel will inflict 1
hit point of damage to any enemy
character that it touches.
Damage canceling requires 1
reiatsu stock to perform and
cannot be used against super
moves.

- OFFENSE -

LIGHT ATTACK: Y button (can be
changed in options) MEDIUM
ATTACK: X button (can be changed
in options) HEAVY ATTACK: A
button (can be changed in
options) THROW: left/right +
medium/heavy attack, standing
next to enemy SPECIALS/SUPERS:
varies between characters; check
command list / use hotkeys
REINFORCE SPECIALS: strongest
variation of special attacks,
always executed
     with strong attack button,
     usually depletes 1/3 of
     reiryoku
gauge and abbreviated with "RF"

All characters besides Bonnie
have three different levels of
normal attacks (light, medium,
and heavy), which have their own
dedicated buttons and can be
chained together in various
ways. The behavior of normal
attacks changes depending on
whether your character is in a
standing, crouching, or aerial
state. If a normal attack hits
your opponent, you can
immediately follow it up with a
stronger attack to perform what
is called a chain combo. An
example of a simple chain combo
is: light attack -> medium
attack -> heavy attack. For most
characters, you cannot follow a
medium or heavy attack with an
attack of equal or lesser
strength; you usually have to
either perform a stronger normal
attack, flash step, or
special/super move to keep your
combo going.

Throws can be performed when
standing next to an opponent.
They normally don't cause much
damage, but they will often put
your opponent into a flying or
stunned state, which can be
useful for setting up additional
attacks. Throws cannot be
performed in mid-air. If you
walk or flash step out of range
of an opponent at the very same
moment he attempts to throw you,
the throw will fail and the
enemy character will briefly
enter a tripping/kneeling
animation. If you strike an
opponent at the same moment he
attempts to throw you, or if
both characters attempt to throw
each other at the same time,
they will both be knocked back
from each other.

Each character has a variety of
unique special moves and super
moves, which can either be
performed by specific button
combinations (listed in the
pause menu) or by using the
touch screen hotkeys. Blue
hotkeys are for specials, and
red hotkeys are for supers.

Like normal attacks, many
special moves vary in strength,
speed, and behavior depending on
which attack button you use.
Specials performed with the
light attack button are usually
quick but have a long recovery
time. Those performed with the
medium attack button are usually
slow but have a quick recovery
time. Those performed with the
heavy attack button often
combine the best of both worlds.
The strongest of these three
variations is called a
reinforced (RF) special move.
Performing RF specials uses up
one segment of your outer
reiryoku gauge. If your reiryoku
gauge is empty, attempting to
perform an RF special will
result in the use of the next-
strongest variation of that
special instead. Using the touch
screen to perform specials will
have the same function as using
the heavy attack button, which
means that you'll always use the
RF version with the touch screen
if it's available.

Super moves are typically the
strongest attacks available to
your character, and they do not
vary in strength depending on
which attack button you press to
perform them. Every super in the
game requires either 1 or 3
reiatsu stock to perform.

- MISCELLANEOUS -

KYORAKU/UKITAKE TEAM SUPER
Kyoraku and Ukitake each have a
super attack that is only
available if both of them are
present and on the same team
during battle.

YACHIRU/NEMU STUN GLITCH Yachiru
and Nemu are not affected by
attacks at all when in a stunned
state. All attacks travel right
through them and cause no
damage. There is no delay when
recovering from the stun,
either. Holding down guard as
they recover from a stun will
prevent them from being damaged
by any attacks that happen to
hit them as the stun wears off.

┌--------------┐
│ REIFU (霊符) │
└--------------┘
Reifu are the spirit cards used
during battle to power-up your
character and power-down your
opponents. Various level 1 cards
are earned through Story Mode,
level 4 cards through Arcade and
Challenge Modes, some through
password entry, and the
remainder in Urahara's shop. You
can arrange up to 5 decks of 15
cards each in Deck Construction
mode. 10 cards from your chosen
deck will be randomly selected
and arranged for use during
gameplay.

You can usually obtain up to 4
copies of each level 1 card, 3
of each level 2, 2 of each level
3, and 1 of each level 4. Some
cards only have one level. You
do not have to re-buy cards
after use; your stock will be
fully replenished after each
battle for later use.

Below is a data chart for all
the various reifu available in
the game, sorted in the same
order as most of the in-game
menus. Each data box follows
this format:

+--------------------------+----
| 霊符 REIFU | explanation of card
effect | | 名 NAME | timer | how
to earn level 4 card |
+--------------------------+----

The timer indicates the
difference between the level
1/2/3/4 versions of each card
and can be of any one of the
following types:
 instantaneous: card's effect is
 instant and will be immediately
 replaced
    after use
 duration: card's effect lasts
 over a certain period of time
  linger: card's effect is
  instant, but the card will
  remain onscreen for
a set time before being replaced

You'll notice that the timer for
a few cards do not either
increase or decrease
consistently between levels.
This is usually because the
higher level version has a more
potent effect rather than a
simple difference in duration.
(For example, I believe that the
higher level versions of Reiatsu
Capture will steal a greater
amount of reiatsu stock from the
opponent than the lower level
versions would.)

The bottom-right corner of each
data box indicates what must be
completed to obtain the level 4
version of the card. As an
alternative to Arcade and
Challenge Mode, you can also buy
the level 4 cards after
purchasing ALL the level 1-3
cards from the shop. The level 4
versions cost quite a lot at
200000 apiece, though. It's
recommended to earn them through
gameplay if it's not too
difficult for you.

┌------------------------------┐
│ SIMPLE MODE (簡易操作モード) │
└------------------------------┘
When setting up the game, there
will be an option to change the
control method from Manual to
Auto. Auto activates Simple
Mode, which has the following
features:

AUTOMATIC CHAIN COMBO This
feature strings attacks together
whenever possible. For an
example of how this works, start
Training Mode with Ichigo in
Manual mode. Walk up next to
your opponent and quickly press
the light attack button 3 times
in succession. You will strike
him with 3 light attacks. Now
return to the Character Select
screen and change the control
method to Auto. Walk up to your
opponent and quickly press the
light attack button 3 times once
more. Ichigo will use the light
attack -> medium attack -> heavy
attack chain combo instead. Auto
chain combo will attempt to use
the most damaging variation of
your command when you are
guaranteed to hit the enemy. Be
aware, however, that this limits
the number of custom combos you
can discover and execute on your
own. Auto chain combo isn't
recommended for advanced players
or anybody who wants to be truly
competitive.

AUTOMATIC GUARD This feature
will cause your character to
automatically guard whenever
possible. Only your opponents'
counter attacks will
successfully connect.

SPECIAL HOTKEYS When in Simple
Mode, the hotkeys for specials
and supers will be displayed by
default. You can still use the
change button to show only the
reifu cards.

┌-------------------------------
│ SECTION IV: STORY MODE
(ストーリーモード) │
└-------------------------------
NOTE: Ichigo and Renji cannot
use their bankai supers in their
respective story episodes until
they reach the point where they
learn how to perform them in the
manga/anime. Ganju cannot summon
Bonnie in his episode because
he's apparently searching for
her.

┌-------------------------------
│ CHARACTER AND CONTROL METHOD

│ ICHIGO WALKTHROUGH │
└--------------------┘
You must complete Ichigo's story
before you are allowed to play
anyone else's. Ichigo's story
has many branching paths with
certain conditions that must be
met in order to successfully
complete it. The story dialogue
will give you hints as to what
is required of you (usually with
bright red text), but it's all
for nothing if you can't read
Japanese. Below is a walkthrough
with all the requirements for
successfully completing Ichigo's
story. I'm not sure if it's the
most effective route, but I can
verify that it works.

Training: complete the
instruction sequence vs Ganju:
defeat him vs Renji: defeat him
vs Kenpachi: defeat him vs
Byakuya: defeat him vs Renji:
defeat him with 0 reiatsu stock
remaining vs Hinamori: defeat
her vs Hitsugaya & Hinamori:
defeat them vs Kurotsuchi:
defeat him vs Renji: defeat him
with 0 reiatsu stock remaining
vs Hitsugaya & Hinamori: defeat
Hitsugaya first, Hinamori second
vs Ichimaru: defeat him vs
Renji: defeat him with 3 reiatsu
stock remaining vs Kyoraku &
Ukitake: defeat them vs Tosen:
defeat him vs Tosen & Komamura:
defeat them vs Renji: defeat him
with 3 reiatsu stock remaining
vs Kyoraku & Ukitake: execute a
20-hit combo (hit both at once
with Super B) vs Soifon: defeat
her vs Genryusai: defeat him
Advanced Training: complete the
instruction sequence vs Byakuya:
defeat him

You can skip the training levels
by pressing the SELECT button if
you wish. Below is a translation
of Japanese phrases used during
the training levels. General
command translations are listed
above in SECTION I under COMMON
TERMS.

ジャンプ中に    while jumping
立ち中に        while standing
しゃがみ中に    while crouching
霊符をタッチ    touch reifu
覚悟を決めたら  when finished
防御中に        while guarding
ダメージ中に    while taking damage

The first 5 matches will always
be the same no matter what you
do. Once you reach Renji for the
second time, he'll serve as a
checkpoint of sorts, and
depending on how many reiatsu
stock you have in reserves when
you defeat him, you'll branch
out to different paths. In order
to fully complete Ichigo's
story, you must defeat every
character listed above at least
once. If you successfully
complete all the requirements in
Ichigo's story, it will be
marked as COMPLETE in the
episode select screen. If you
skip over a character, it will
be marked CLEAR and you will
have to replay it in order to
unlock everything.

You do not have to play through
Ichigo's story in the exact
order listed above, but this
seems to be the simplest route
that I can find. For
completion's sake, below is a
translation of all the special
objectives you are given
whenever you fight any character
for the second time. Pay
attention to the text before the
match, and if you see a red
phrase, check below to see what
it means.

RENJI: 霊圧が最大 = win with max
reiatsu stock (3) ->
KYORAKU/UKITAKE ROUTE 霊圧が最小 =
win with min reiatsu stock (0)
-> HITSUGAYA/HINAMORI ROUTE それ以外
= win with other condition (1 or
2 reiatsu stock) -> KENPACHI
ROUTE

HITSUGAYA & HINAMORI: 誰が先に倒れるか =
defeat me (Hitsugaya) first

KENPACHI: 魂魄の残量 = win with a
small amount of health (exact
amount unknown)

KYORAKU & UKITAKE: 連続ヒット数 =
perform a large combo (20+ hits)

KUROTSUCHI:
瞬歩禁止など = do not use flash steps

TOSEN & KOMAMURA:
霊府使用枚数 = use all of your reifu

┌--------------┐
│ UNLOCK GUIDE │
└--------------┘
After completing Ichigo's story,
the episodes for Orihime, Uryu,
Chad, and Ganju are unlocked.
Clearing their episodes opens up
additional ones in the following
order:

Orihime -> Kenpachi -> Tosen ->
Komamura -> Komamura (unmasked)
Uryu -> Kurotsuchi -> Soifon ->
Yoruichi -> Rukia Chad ->
Kyoraku -> Ukitake -> Genryusai
-> Ichimaru Ganju -> Renji ->
Byakuya -> Hitsugaya -> Hinamori

Clearing all of the above
episodes unlocks Aizen's, and
clearing his unlocks the final
episode. Clearing the final
story episode unlocks Time
Attack Mode, Survival Mode, and
grants you a one-time bonus of
500000 points to spend at the
shop.

Clearing Ichigo's story yields
100000 shop points each time.
Clearing other episodes grants
you 1000 points per match. A
variety of level 1 reifu are
unlocked through Ichigo's story,
which then allows you to buy
additional copies and higher
level versions of those cards
through the shop.

Initially, 14 characters are
available for play in Arcade,
VS, Training, Time Attack,
Survival, and Challenge modes.
Below are the requirements for
unlocking the other 14
characters. (Not all characters
are available in Challenge
Mode.)

Ukitake: defeat him in Ichigo's
story Komamura: defeat him in
Ichigo's story Soifon: defeat
her in Ichigo's story Genryusai:
defeat him in Ichigo's story
Yoruichi: clear (or skip)
advanced training in Ichigo's

story Komamura (Unmasked): clear
Komamura's story Rukia: clear
Yoruichi's story Kon: clear
Rukia's story Aizen: clear all
other characters' stories Ichigo
(Hollow): clear the final story

Once a character is unlocked,
you may purchase that
character's corresponding System
Voice set from the shop. Voice
sets for non-playable characters
are made available as follows:

Yamada Hanatarou: clear Ganju's
story Madarame Ikkaku: clear
Kenpachi's story Ayasegawa
Yumichika: clear Kenpachi's
story Urahara Kisuke: clear
Yoruichi's story Kira Iduru:
clear Ichimaru's story Shiba
Kaien: clear the final story

Event and character graphics are
unlocked in the Gallery simply
after viewing them in Story
Mode. However, if you press
Start to skip through the
cutscenes, you might skip over
some of these graphics, which
prevents you from unlocking
them. Hold down to fast-forward
through story mode text instead
of skipping it, and you'll
unlock everything.

┌-------------------------------
│ SECTION V: ARCADE MODE
(アーケードモード) │
└-------------------------------
All characters are available for
play in Arcade Mode, which
consists of 6 1-on-1 fights in
succession. Clearing each
character's arcade sequence for
the first time will net you a
significant reward, either a
level 4 reifu or 200000 points
for use in the shop. The word
"CLEAR" will appear in the
bottom-left corner of the screen
for each character you've
already played. You will also
receive 2000 points from each
match every time you play.

│ SECTION VI: VS MODE (ＶＳモード) │
└-------------------------------
Versus Mode has play modes for
up to 4 players total, either
human or CPU, online or offline,
and single-cart or multi-cart.
Choose VS CPU for matches
against only the computer,
WIRELESS BATTLE for matches
against other players with their
own copies of the game, DOWNLOAD
PLAY for single-cart
multiplayer, or Wi-Fi CONNECTION
for Internet multiplayer through
the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.
All modes besides VS CPU will
reward you with 2000 points for
the shop for every match you
play, whether you win or lose.

┌-----------------------------┐
│ DS WIRELESS & DOWNLOAD PLAY │
└-----------------------------┘
As I do not have another DS or
copy of the game available for
testing, I cannot provide
detailed information regarding
either of these gameplay modes.
However, all characters and
stages are known to be available
in single-cart download play,
and no particular aspect of the
game seems to be restricted. The
only drawback appears to be long
load times.

┌------------------┐
│ WI-FI CONNECTION │
└------------------┘
Bleach DS features a very
fleshed-out online mode with
ranking matches, friend battles,
and a few filters for rule
settings. A translation of most
of the menu:

If you have not gone online with
your Nintendo DS prior to this,
you may have to adjust settings
in the Wi-Fi SETTINGS screen
(third selection on the menu).
The Wi-Fi configuration menus
are set-up in a completely
different manner than the rest
of the game and should in fact
bear a very close resemblance to
the Wi-Fi configuration menus in
any other online-capable
Nintendo DS game. If you have an
English-language Nintendo DS
game with Wi-Fi Connection
features, the settings menu in
Bleach DS should look exactly
the same, only in Japanese. If
you require a translation, check

Using the REIFU OFF filter also
prohibits the use of team

JAPAN BATTLE will randomly pit
you against anyone else
connecting to the servers,
FRIEND BATTLE will narrow down
the field to those on your
Friend List, and SOUL SOCIETY
RANKING MATCH will attempt to
match you up in a 1-on-1 fight
with another player who holds
the same rank as you. All new
players start with a spirit
level of 1000. You earn and lose
points as you win and lose
matches, and your rank will
change accordingly. Should you
disconnect from a ranking match
by turning off your DS or
letting the battery run out,
your spirit level will be
reduced by 2000 points.

All new players start with the
rank title of "第十席霊位," which
roughly translates to "Tenth
Seat." The second character is a
number which changes as your
spirit level increases. Based on
the experience I've put into Wi-
Fi so far, the promotions are as
follows:

          28000 第一席霊位
          23000 第二席霊位
          18500 第三席霊位
          14500 第四席霊位
          11000 第五席霊位
           8000 第六席霊位
           5500 第七席霊位
           3500 第八席霊位
           2000 第九席霊位
            0 第十席霊位

You advance to Ninth Seat after
earning 1000 points, to Eighth
Seat after earning another 1500,
to Seventh Seat after earning
another 2000, and so on with the
interval increasing by 500
points for each iteration. I can
confirm that the pattern
continues until at least Third
Seat. Assuming that Vice Captain
and Captain follow First Seat,
the requirement for the top rank
would be 39500 points.

┌-------------------------------
│ SECTION VII: TRAINING MODE
(トレーニングモード) │
└-------------------------------
This mode allows 1-on-1 practice
against the computer. Your life
bar automatically refills itself
and you can instruct your CPU
opponent to perform certain
actions.

┌-------------------------------
│ SECTION VIII: TIME ATTACK MODE
(タイムアタックモード) │
└-------------------------------
This mode is unlocked upon the
completion of the final episode
of Story Mode. It consists of a
sequence of 20 1-on-1 fights
against the computer in the
following order:

Ganju
Orihime
Chad
Hinamori
Renji
Uryu
Rukia
Tosen
Komamura
Kurotsuchi
Soifon
Hitsugaya
Ichimaru
Kenpachi
Kyoraku
Ukitake
Byakuya
Yoruichi
Ichigo
Genryusai

Reifu can be reused between
battles and the maximum money
reward for completion seems to
be 48000. No items are earned
through Time Attack Mode.

┌-------------------------------
│ SECTION IX: SURVIVAL MODE
(サバイバルモード) │
└-------------------------------
This mode is also unlocked upon
completion of the final episode
of Story Mode. Survival Mode
consists of an endless amount of
1-on-1 fights against the
computer until you die or quit.
Health and reifu are not
restored between matches, and
your reiatsu and reiryoku gauges
carry over between matches
instead of being reset to zero.
The recommended strategy is to
use a deck built mainly for
healing. Aizen is a preferable
character to use, as the AI has
a hard time dealing with many of
his moves.

The order of the first 20
matches is pre-determined (same
order as Time Attack Mode,
above). After 20 matches, you
will fight against any of the
previous 20 characters randomly
(though it seems that there is a
greater chance of replaying
characters that gave you more
trouble).

No items are rewarded, but the
monetary gain is impressive. You
receive a moderate amount for
the first few wins, but after a
time the amount begins
increasing by leaps and bounds.

REWARDS
  1 win:      200
  2 wins:    1000
  3 wins:    3000
  4 wins:    7000

┌-------------------------------
│ SECTION X: CHALLENGE MODE
(チャレンジモード) │
└-------------------------------
This mode is available for 20
different characters. The goal
is to complete each of the 10
chain combo sequences displayed
on screen for each character.
You will receive 50000 shop
points and a level 4 reifu upon
completion of each character's
challenge.

┌--------------┐
│ GENERAL TIPS │
└--------------┘

UNDERSTANDING CHAIN COMBOS AND
INSERTING BUFFERING TECHNIQUES
Normal, special, and super
attacks in Bleach DS are
generally chained from weaker
attacks to stronger attacks,
meaning that it is usually
possible to follow a light
attack with a medium attack and
a medium with a heavy, but not a
heavy to a medium or a heavy
followed by another heavy.
Furthermore, it is usually
possible to chain a
light/medium/heavy normal attack
to a special and a special to a
super, but not the other way
around. (There are a few notable
exceptions to this rule, which
should become apparent as you
play each individual characters'
challenges. Faster characters
can chain light attacks together
indefinitely, Uryu can fire
three heavy attacks in
succession with his bow,
Komamura can link standing heavy
to crouching heavy, etc.)
Because of this limitation, most
combo challenges cannot be
performed exactly as they're
written, and you'll have to
insert extra attacks and
techniques between certain moves
in order to link them together
without breaking the chain. The
most common examples are using
flash steps to continue combos
on the ground and double jumps
to continue combos in mid-air.
Many required and recommended
buffering techniques will be
listed in the walkthrough below
in [brackets].

POSITIONING Many combo
challenges are easier if done
right next to the wall. In the
walkthrough below, assume that
every combo is meant to be done
next to the wall unless stated
otherwise.

SPECIALS AND REINFORCED SPECIALS
Many special attacks have three
different versions: light,
medium, and reinforced (RF),
which are performed with the
light, medium, and heavy attack
buttons, respectively. Remember
that using the touch screen to
perform specials has the same
behavior as using the heavy
attack button, so using the
touch screen to perform specials
will always perform the RF
version for that special if it
exists and if you have enough
reiryoku to perform it. If a
combo challenge asks you to
perform the RF version, you
cannot perform the light or
medium version. The opposite
holds true as well.
Additionally, light specials
usually have a quick set-up but
long recovery time, and medium
specials usually have a long
set-up and quick recovery time.
If you're having trouble trying
to complete a combo with one
variation of a special attack,
try out the other and see if it
makes it any easier.

INSTANT AERIAL DASH (IAD)
Sometimes you'll be asked to
link a series of aerial attacks
followed by a series of standing
attacks. Typically, the ideal
way to do this is to perform an
instant aerial dash, which will
keep your character close enough
to the ground so you can land
and continue the combo quickly.
To perform an IAD, jump
diagonally towards the CPU
dummy, and then immediately
press forward to dash once
you're in mid-air. Perform the
required aerial attacks before
you touch the ground, and then
follow up with the rest of the
combo. (Depending on how close
you land to the dummy, it can
sometimes be helpful to quickly
dash next to the dummy once you
touch ground again, but this
isn't necessary for every
combo.)

OFF-THE-GROUND (OTG) ATTACKS
When you strike a falling
opponent in mid-air, it will
normally keep him in an aerial
state. However, if you strike
him just as he initially hits
the ground, it will put him into
a standing state, which allows
you to proceed with a standing
combo more easily. The timing
window for this technique is
very strict.

┌-------------------------------
│ INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE
WALKTHROUGHS │
└-------------------------------
Below are instructions that
should be useful in completing
many of the various challenge
combos in the game. If a combo
is not listed below, then it
should be easy enough to
complete as it is written.

Wait until the RF-B registers
before finishing with the super.

ICHIGO 8: T → [OTG] cL → sM → sH
→ [FS] → aM → aH → [D] sL → sM →
sH
  → RF-B → S-C
Flash step diagonally upwards to
connect sH to aM. The dash is
optional if you manage to flash
step close enough to the dummy
for the rest of the combo to
reach. Both swipes of S-C must
connect in order for it to
register.

ICHIGO 9: RF-A → aM → [FS] → aL
→ aM → aH You must stand a short
distance away from the dummy in
order to make RF-A juggle him.
Jump diagonally towards him
while he's being juggled to
connect aM, and then flash step
closer to him to finish the
combo.

ICHIGO 10: cH → aM → aM → [FS] →
aM → [FS] → aM → [FS] → aM →
RF-C Pretty straightforward.
Make sure to jump and double
jump high enough during the
first two aMs in order to make
the rest of the combo connect.

RUKIA 1: sL → sM → sH → S-A
Use the medium version of S-A.

RUKIA 3: cL → sH → [FS] → S-D

RUKIA 4: [IAD] aL → aM → cL → sH
→ SU-A Both the lightning and
the fireball parts of SU-A must
connect for it to register.

RUKIA 5: [IAD] aM → aH → cL → cH
→ SU-B

RUKIA 6A: [IAD] aL → aL → aL →
[D] sL → sL → sL → sL → [FS] →
sL → sL
  → sL → sL → [FS] → sL → sL →
  sL → sL → [FS] → sL → sL → cH
  → aL → aL → aL → aL → aL → aL
  → aL → aL
This one isn't quite as
intimidating as it might seem as
first. When on the ground, stay
close enough to the dummy to get
4 light attacks in at a time
between flash steps. When in the
air, get 4 light attacks in
before and after the double
jump.

RUKIA 6B: [IAD] aL → aL → aL →
[D] sL → [D] sL → [D] sL → [D]
sL
  → [D] sL → [D] sL → [D] sL →
  [D] sL → [D] sL → [D] sL → [D]
  sL → [D] sL → [D] sL → [D] sL
  → cH → aL → aL → aL → aL → aL
  → aL → aL → aL
An alternate method for Rukia's
6th combo. If you're fast
enough, it's possible to
alternate between dashing and sL
indefinitely.

RUKIA 8: RF-D → RF-C → [D] sL →
sM → sH → RF-B You must use RF-D
to kick the dummy from one side
of the screen to the other. RF-C
will freeze him in place so you
can run up to him and finish the
combo.

RUKIA 9: aH → S-A → aL → aM → aH
Position yourself between the
dummy and the wall to keep S-A
from pushing you backwards. Jump
straight into the air and
connect aH and S-A just before
you touch the ground, then jump
again and follow up with the
rest of the combo.

RUKIA 10: cH → aL → aL → RF-A →
SU-A The key to this one is
jumping high enough during the 2
aLs so that SU-A is able to
connect at the end. Get as much
height as you can before hitting
the dummy with the light
attacks, and you should be fine.

ORIHIME 3: [IAD] aL → aM → cL →
cH → S-C

ORIHIME 4: S-A → S-D Time S-D so
that it connects as S-A is
coming back towards you.

ORIHIME 6: SU-B → [IAD] aM → aH
→ [IAD] aM → aH → [IAD] aM → aH
  → [IAD] aM → aH → [IAD] aM →
  aH → [IAD] aM → aH
Pin the dummy against the wall
with SU-B to hold him in place.
Perform an IAD to connect two
aerial hits, land, and repeat 5
times to finish the combo before
he recovers.

ORIHIME 7: cL → cM → cH → RF-A →
[D] cL → cM → cH → cL → cM → cH
RF-A will hit the dummy a second
time as it returns to you,
allowing you to chain cH to cL.

ORIHIME 8: T → SU-B → cL → cM →
cH → RF-A → [D] sL → sH → aL →
aH
  → aL → aH → RF-B
It might be easier to execute
this combo in the middle of the
arena as opposed to the wall.
Perform SU-B first, and then
throw the dummy into the
barrier. Hit him with cL as he
bounces back towards you, then
follow with the rest of the
combo.

ORIHIME 9: SU-A → SU-B → S-D
Perform SU-B first, and pin the
dummy against the wall with it.
Charge SU-A to maximum size
before you release it.
Performing S-D will make the
previous barrier formed with
SU-B disappear, so you have to
time it such that SU-A hits the
dummy a second time as you're
setting up S-D.

ORIHIME 10: cL → cH → SU-A → [D]
cL → cM → cH → [D] cL → cH →
SU-A
   → [D] cL → cM → cH → [D] cL →
   cH → SU-A → [D] cL → cM → cH
   → [D] cL → cH
I can't think of much advice to
give on this one besides getting
a feel for the timing needed to
keep the chain from breaking.
Just do it as it says. It's a
little easier to time the normal
hits if you manage to let SU-A
carry the dummy back and forth a
little bit whenever it hits him.

URYU 2: S-A → S-B → RF-A Launch
S-B first, then perform S-A. S-B
will fall and hit the dummy
after S-A.

URYU 3: [IAD] aL → aL → aL → [D]
sL → sL → sL → S-C

URYU 5: sM → sH → sM → [FS] → sH
→ sM → sH → SU-B

URYU 6: T → [OTG] cL → sH → [FS]
→ cL → sH → [FS] → cL → sH →
SU-B

URYU 7: S-A → S-B → [IAD] aL →
aL → aL → sL → sM → sH → RF-A
Launch S-B first, just like his
second challenge.

URYU 8: RF-C → aL → aL → aL → aL
→ aL → aM → aH → SU-B Charge
RF-C to its max size, and it'll
juggle the dummy enough to allow
you to follow up with the rest
of the combo.

URYU 9: sL → sM → sH → S-B →
RF-C → aL → aL → aM → aH → SU-B
Launch S-B first. You don't have
to charge RF-C this time. S-B
should hit the dummy at the same
time as RF-C, so following up
with the aerial part should be
easy.

URYU 10: sM → sH → sM → [FS] →
sH → sM → sH → [FS] → sM → sH →
sM
  → [FS] → sH → sM → sH

CHAD 4: [IAD] aL → aM → sL → sM
→ RF-A → SU-A It's easier to
link RF-A to SU-A if done in the
middle of the arena as opposed
to the wall.

CHAD 5: [IAD] aM → aH → [D] cL →
cH → RF-B → SU-B

CHAD 8: cL → sH → RF-B → [OTG]
cL → cM → S-B → SU-A sH will
launch the dummy, and RF-B will
bounce him off the wall. Turn
around and use an OTG hit to
finish the rest of the combo.

CHAD 9: cL → cH → S-B → SU-A →
[OTG] cL → cH → SU-B → aL → aM →
aL
  → aM → aH
The key to this one is starting
the combo the proper distance
away from the wall in order to
time the OTG hit.

CHAD 10: [IAD] aH → RF-C → [IAD]
aH → RF-C → [IAD] aH → RF-C →
[IAD] aH
  → cL → cM → cH → SU-C

GANJU 4: cH → S-D The light
version of S-D summons Bonnie on
the same plane as Ganju, and the
medium version summons her on
the opposite plane. You must
perform S-D first and then time
cH so that it hits the dummy
right before Bonnie does.

GANJU 5: [IAD] aL → aM → sL → sM
→ SU-A

GANJU 6: [IAD] aM → aH → cL → cH
→ SU-B

GANJU 7: S-D → SU-C SU-C travels
in an arc. Time it so that it
intercepts the dummy after
Bonnie launches him.

GANJU 8: [IAD] aM → aH → [D] sL
→ sM → RF-C → aL → aM → aH → aL
→ aM
  → aH
Dash after landing to stay close
to the dummy or else RF-C
probably won't connect. Jump
after him quickly after the
launch to get in the rest of the
combo.

GANJU 9: [IAD] aL → aM → sL → sM
→ S-B → [OTG] cL → cM → cH →
RF-B
  → SU-B
Don't perform this one right
next to the wall. S-B will carry
the dummy across the screen,
giving you enough time to dash
up next to him and follow with
the rest of the combo after the
bounce.

GANJU 10: RF-A → RF-D → aL → aM
→ aL → aM → aH RF-D will summon
Bonnie on both planes. She'll
run across the opposite plane as
Ganju first and the same plane
second. Use RF-D first, throw
RF-A, and then jump into the air
to finish the rest of the combo.
You have to be careful to time
all of it so that Bonnie does
not hit Ganju.

RENJI 4: [IAD] aL → aM → sL → sH
→ SU-A

RENJI 5: [IAD] aL → aH → cL → cH
→ SU-B

RENJI 6: T → S-C Throw the dummy
from around the middle of the
screen, and then use the medium
version of S-C to hit him after
he bounces off the wall.

RENJI 9: [cM] → RF-B → cL → sH →
SU-A Use cM to launch the dummy
into the air, and then use RF-B
just as he begins falling back
to the ground. Follow with the
rest of the combo after he
bounces off the wall.

RENJI 10: S-A → [OTG] cL → sH →
[FS] → cL → sH → [FS] → cL → sH
→ RF-A
  → SU-A
Use the medium version of S-A,
as it has less recovery time.
Make sure to wait until RF-A
registers before following up
with SU-A.

BYAKUYA 5: SU-B → [IAD] aM → aH
→ [IAD] aM → aH → [IAD] aM → aH

BYAKUYA 6: [IAD] aM → aH → sL →
sH → SU-C

BYAKUYA 7: T → S-B Throw the
dummy to the other side of the
screen and use S-B right as he
bounces off the wall.

BYAKUYA 8: [IAD] aL → aM → aH →
sL → sH → S-B → SU-A

BYAKUYA 9: S-D → sL → S-D → sL →
SU-C Perform two S-Ds at the
start of the combo, then follow
with two sLs. The second S-D
should hit the dummy between the
sLs.

BYAKUYA 10: cL → sH → RF-C → [D]
cL → sH → RF-C → S-B → SU-C Dash
towards the dummy a little bit
after the first RF-C.

ICHIMARU 6: [IAD] aM → aH → sL →
sH → SU-B

ICHIMARU 7: T → [OTG] RF-C → sL
→ sH → S-A

ICHIMARU 8: S-C → RF-C → sL → sH
→ RF-C → cL → cH → aL → aM → aH
→ aL
   → aM → aH → RF-A
Use the medium version of S-C,
as it has less recovery time.
Ichimaru's aH has multiple hits,
and the last hit will smash the
opponent back down to the ground
if it connects. In order to
complete this combo, you must
enter the next command before aH
finishes so you can keep
juggling the dummy in mid-air.

ICHIMARU 9: cL → cH → RF-C → sL
→ sH → RF-C → cL → cH → RF-E →
SU-A Ichimaru's cH also has
multiple hits, and the last hit
will launch the opponent into
the air if it connects. In order
to complete this combo, you must
enter the next command before cH
finishes so you can continue the
combo on the ground.

ICHIMARU 10: cH → cH → [FS] → cH
→ cH → RF-C → cL → cH → RF-C →
cL
  → cH → RF-C → cL → cH → S-A
Flash step after cH hits the
second time to prevent the dummy
from being launched, then follow
with the rest of the combo.

KENPACHI 4: T → S-B Throw the
dummy from around the middle of
the screen, and then use the
light version of S-B to hit him
after the bounce.

KENPACHI 5: [IAD] aM → aH → sL →
sH → RF-E → SU-B

KENPACHI 6: [S-D] → [SU-A] →
[SU-A] → [SU-A] → [IAD] aH → aH
→ [D] sL
   → sH → sH → RF-E → aM → aM →
   aM → aM → aH
Fully charge S-D and perform
three SU-As before starting this
combo. Kenpachi's S-D
temporarily increases the length
of his sword, and his SU-A
temporarily allows him to chain
normal attacks together in ways
that typically aren't possible.
(His SU-A also prevents
opponents from damage cancelling
out of normal attacks.)

KENPACHI 7: [S-D] → [SU-A] →
[SU-A] → [SU-A] → sL → sL → sM →
sH → sH
   → [FS] → sL → sL → sM → sH →
   sH → [FS] → sL → sL → sM → sH
   → sH → [FS] → sL → sL → sM →
   sH → sH

KENPACHI 8: [S-D] → sM → RF-E →
[SU-A] → sM → RF-E → [SU-A] → sM
→ RF-E
   → aL → aM → aH
This time, use SU-A to cancel
RF-E and keep the combo going on
the ground. You may have to
double jump during the aerial
part to connect all three hits.

KENPACHI 9: cL → cM → sH → S-B →
[SU-A] → [OTG] cL → cM → sH →
S-B
   → [SU-A] → [OTG] cL → cM → sH
   → S-B → [SU-A] → [OTG] cL →
   cM → sH → S-B
Use the light version of S-B, as
it has a shorter set-up time
than the medium version. Use
SU-A after S-B to cancel its
recovery time, then keep the
combo going. I hope you're good
at timing OTG hits...

KENPACHI 10: cL → S-E → [SU-A] →
cL → S-E → [SU-A] → cL → S-E →
[SU-A]
   → cL → S-E
This one should be a piece of
cake if you completed his 9th
challenge. Use the light version
of S-E, and perform SU-A
immediately after S-E connects
in order to prevent the dummy
from being launched.

HITSUGAYA 3: S-C → cL → cM → cH
Perform cL after S-C hits the
dummy for the second time.

HITSUGAYA 7: S-C → [IAD] aM → aH
→ cL → cM → cH → RF-B → SU-A
Perform aM after S-C hits the
dummy for the second time. cH
should be done quickly in order
for it to connect.

HITSUGAYA 8: RF-A → [IAD] aL →
aM → sL → sM → sH → aL → aM → aL
→ aM
   → RF-A
Stand a short distance away from
the dummy so that RF-A hits him
multiple times. This should give
you enough time to connect aL.

HITSUGAYA 9: RF-A → RF-C → cL →
cM → cH → RF-B → SU-A Perform
RF-C first, then immediately
follow with RF-A. RF-C will hit
a second time, and you can
follow with the rest of the
combo. Perform SU-A immediately
after RF-B registers to prevent
Hitsugaya from jumping.

HITSUGAYA 10: SU-A → RF-C →
[IAD] aL → aM → cL → cM → [FS] →
[cL] → cH
   → RF-B → SU-A
Stand far enough away from the
dummy so that SU-A hits him at
the end of its arc. RF-C will
carry the dummy back towards
Hitsugaya. If you have trouble
connecting cM to cH, try
inserting a flash step and cL as
written above.

HINAMORI 3: cL → cM → cH → S-C →
[FS] → cL → cM → Ch Perform S-C
first, and time the first three
hits so that S-C detonates
immediately after the first cH.
Flash step next to the dummy and
continue the combo.

HINAMORI 7: SU-B → RF-E This one
is easier if done from the
initial position instead of the
wall. Just do it as it says as
quickly as possible with the
touch screen.

HINAMORI 8: T → RF-C → cL → cH →
aL → aH → aL → aH → RF-A Shoot
RF-C in the opposite direction
from the dummy, placing Hinamori
between the dummy and the
fireballs. Throw him into the
fireballs, and then continue
with cL.

HINAMORI 9: RF-C → sL → sH → aL
→ aM → aH → RF-C → aL → aM → aH
   → RF-C
Position the dummy next to the
wall, stand right next to him,
and perform RF-C. Two fireballs
should detonate, leaving one
next to him. Wait a little, then
jump above the dummy and perform
RF-C again to place 3 fireballs
above him. When the fireball
next to him detonates, continue
the actual combo with sL and
launch with sH. One of the
fireballs in the air should
connect after the first aH,
allowing you to continue the
combo with aL. Do it as it says
to from there.

HINAMORI 10: RF-B → [IAD] aL →
aM → sL → sH → aL → aH → aL → aH
→ RF-C
   → [FS] → aH → RF-A
Stand a short distance away from
the dummy so that RF-B connects
at the end of its arc. Get
enough height during the jump
and double jump so that RF-C is
performed at the top of the
screen. This will hold the dummy
in place, allowing you to flash
step next to him and finish the
combo.

TOSEN 1: RF-C → RF-A Use RF-C to
carry the dummy from one side of
the screen to the other. RF-A
will connect shortly after he
bounces off the wall.

TOSEN 2: sL → sM → [FS] → [sL] →
sH → S-B If you have trouble
connecting S-B at the end, try
inserting a flash step and sL to
shorten the distance between you
and the dummy.

TOSEN 5: sM → sH → [FS] → [sL] →
S-E

TOSEN 6: [IAD] aM → aH → cL → sM
→ sH → SU-A

TOSEN 7: RF-E → aL → aM → aL →
aM → SU-A Stand far enough away
from the dummy so that RF-E
connects at the very end. This
should give you enough time to
jump and continue the combo.

TOSEN 8: [IAD] aM → aH → cL → sM
→ sH → RF-B → RF-C → RF-E

TOSEN 9: [IAD] aM → aH → RF-D →
[D] cL → sH → RF-C → cL → sH →
RF-A RF-D has the tendency to
push Tosen away from the dummy.
You must perform RF-D in the air
as close to the ground as
possible before you reach the
point where it pushes you back a
greater distance. Once you touch
the ground, dash just a little
bit in order to close the gap
between you and the dummy, then
finish the combo as it is
written.

TOSEN 10: cL → cM → S-B → [D] cL
→ cM → RF-B → RF-C → cL → cH →
aL
  → aM → aL → aM → SU-A
Start this one with Tosen
positioned next to the wall.
This will prevent S-B from
pushing him backwards. You do
not have to follow RF-C with an
OTG hit, but it does help a
little.

KOMAMURA 5: SU-B → aH Make sure
to perform the aH as quickly as
possible.

KOMAMURA 6: T → [OTG] cL → cH →
RF-A → RF-C

KOMAMURA 8: SU-B → SU-A → [FS] →
aH Flash step just enough to get
the dummy in range as he's in
mid-air. If you're too slow with
the aH, you won't be able to
damage him.

KOMAMURA 9: S-A → cL → cH → RF-A
→ [D] cL → cH → RF-A → [D] cL →
cH
   → RF-C
Start the combo with the medium
version of S-A, and dash a
little bit closer to the dummy
after each RF-A.

KOMAMURA 10: sL → sH → cH → [FS]
→ sL → sH → cH → [FS] → sL → sH
→ Ch
  → [FS] → sL → sH → cH → SU-A

KUROTSUCHI 2: S-B → [IAD] aM →
aH

KUROTSUCHI 3: [S-C] → sL → sM →
sH → S-D Use S-C to position
Nemu next to the dummy.

KUROTSUCHI 4: sL → sH → S-E → aH
Start the combo with the medium
version of S-E, then enter the
two standing hits before Nemu
launches the dummy.

KUROTSUCHI 6: S-B → SU-B
Normally, SU-B will enter the
screen from behind Kurotsuchi.
Hold back when performing SU-B
to make it enter from the
opposite side.

KUROTSUCHI 8: S-A → sL → sH →
RF-A → sL → sH → RF-A → sL → sH
→ RF-A
   → sL → sH → S-A
Start the combo with the medium
version of S-A and end it with
the light version.

KUROTSUCHI 9: sL → sH → RF-B →
[IAD] aM → aH → sL → sH → RF-A →
sL
   → sH → RF-E → S-D → sL → sH →
   SU-A
Use the medium version of S-D
immediately after RF-E. You do
not have to follow it with an
OTG hit.

KUROTSUCHI 10: [S-C] → T → S-D →
sL → sH → RF-A → sL → sH → RF-A
→ sL
   → sH → RF-B → [D] S-D → [D]
   sL → sH → SU-A
Position Nemu at one side of the
screen, and throw the dummy
towards her from the other side.
Detonate Nemu with S-D before
the dummy reaches her, and he
should bounce back towards you.
Use RF-B to make Nemu grab him
when she returns, detonate her,
and finish the combo. You may
have to dash towards the other
side of the screen before and
after the second S-D as written
above in order to reach the
dummy.

KYORAKU 5: sL → sM → sH → SU-B
Perform this combo with the
dummy positioned to the left of
Kyoraku. Hold left while using
SU-B to make it connect.

KYORAKU 7: sH → aL → aH → aL →
aH → aL → aH → aL → aH → aL → aH
  → S-B
Kyoraku can use his reiryoku
gauge to jump multiple times in
mid-air instead of using flash
steps.

KYORAKU 8: cL → cH → RF-B → SU-A
→ [OTG] cL → cH → RF-B → aL → aH
→ aL
  → aH → RF-B → SU-B
Perform this combo a short
distance away from the wall so
that you have enough time to
follow SU-A with cL.

KYORAKU 9: sH → aL → aH → aL →
aH → aL → aH → SU-A → aM → aM →
aH
  → SU-A → aM → aM → aH → SU-B
Perform this combo a short
distance away from the wall so
that you have enough time to
follow SU-A with aM. Use
additional jumps instead of
flash steps to keep the combo
going in mid-air.

KYORAKU 10: [IAD] aM → aH → cL →
cM → RF-A → cL → cH → SU-A →
[OTG] cL
   → cH → RF-B → aL → aM → aH →
   RF-B → SU-B
Perform this combo next to the
wall. The crouching attacks will
push you far enough away from
the dummy so that you can get in
all of the required hits.

UKITAKE 1: S-A → sH → sH → sH →
sH Use the medium version of S-A
to hold the dummy in place as
you finish the rest of the
combo.

UKITAKE 3: S-B → S-C Use the
medium version of S-B and the
light version of S-C.

UKITAKE 5: [S-C] / [S-D] → S-E →
cL → cM → cH Set up a white
energy ball with either the
light, medium, or heavy version
of S-E. In order to get it to
actually fire, you have to touch
it with a beam from either S-C
or S-D. Follow with the rest of
the combo after it connects.

UKITAKE 7: [IAD] aM → aH → sL →
sH → SU-B

UKITAKE 9: RF-A → RF-D → SU-B →
[RF-D] → S-E → sL → sM → sH →
SU-A Start the combo by
performing the heavy version of
S-E and then using RF-D later in
order to make it fire.

UKITAKE 10: S-A → S-D → S-E →
S-A → S-D → S-E → S-A → S-D →
S-E → SU-A Start the combo by
performing three heavy S-Es. Use
light versions of S-A to hold
the dummy in place, and then use
light S-Ds to hit him and fire
the pre-set S-Es.

SOIFON 2: [IAD] aL → aH → S-B

SOIFON 9: [SU-B] → [IAD] aL →
RF-B → [IAD] aL → RF-B → cL → cM
→ cH
  → RF-C → SU-A
SU-B will summon 20 ninjas to
drop kick the dummy in 5 sets of
4. Time the aLs so that they hit
right after each 4th ninja. The
ninjas will keep the dummy in
place, allowing you to continue
the combo.

SOIFON 10: SU-B → [IAD] aL → aM
→ S-B → [IAD] aL → aM → S-B →
[IAD] aL
  → aM → S-B → [IAD] aL → aM →
  S-B → [IAD] aL → aM → S-B
Same idea as the last combo.
Time the aerial hits so that
they occur in-between each set
of ninjas.

GENRYUSAI 6: [IAD] aL → aH → cL
→ cM → SU-A

GENRYUSAI 7: [IAD] aL → aM → sL
→ sM → S-E → SU-B

GENRYUSAI 9: sL → sL → sM → S-E
→ SU-A → sL → sL → sM → S-E →
SU-A
   → sL → sL → sM → S-E → SU-A →
   sL → sH → RF-D → aL → aL →
   RF-D → aL → aH
This one is tricky, but you can
do it just about exactly as it
instructs you to. Use light
versions of S-E.

GENRYUSAI 10: [IAD] aL → aM → sL
→ sM → RF-A → [IAD] aL → aM → sL
→ sM
   → [SU-B] → [D] RF-B → [IAD]
   aL → aM → sL → sM → RF-C →
   [IAD] aL → aM → sL → sH → aL
   → aM → S-D
It is tough (if not impossible)
to follow RF-B with aL as this
challenge is written. Use SU-B
as written above to give you
more time to set up the rest of
the combo. Use the light version
of S-D at the very end.

YORUICHI 1: cL → cH → S-A → cL →
cH Set up the medium version of
S-A first and then start the
combo. The knives should connect
as you hit the dummy, allowing
you to chain cH to cL.

YORUICHI 4: [IAD] aL → aH → cL →
cH → SU-A

YORUICHI 5: [IAD] aM → aH → cL →
cM → cH → SU-C

YORUICHI 7: S-B → S-A → aL → aM
→ aH Perform the medium version
of S-A first (same as her first
challenge), and then use S-B to
start the combo.

YORUICHI 8: S-B → [RF-A] → RF-B
→ SU-A → aM → aH → S-C Start the
combo with RF-A, which will
allow you to chain medium S-B to
RF-B. Use the light version of
S-C at the end.

YORUICHI 9: [IAD] aL → aH → RF-A
→ [IAD] aL → aH → [IAD] aL → aH
→ sL
   → sM → RF-B → SU-C → aM → aH
   → aM → aH → RF-C
Start the combo with a mid-air
RF-A, and then dash into the aL
before you touch the ground. The
knives will hold the dummy in
place until you get to the
standing attacks, and you can
simply perform the combo as it
says to from there.

YORUICHI 10: RF-C → RF-A → aM →
RF-C Piece of cake compared to
the previous one. Start with the
RF-A and then perform the other
attacks as fast as you can. The
knives will keep juggling the
dummy.

│ SECTION XI: DECK CONSTRUCTION
(デッキコンストラクション) │
└-------------------------------
This mode is where you arrange
your 5 custom reifu decks for
use during battle. Select a slot
on the main screen to check its
current arrangement.

┌-----------------┐
│ MENU NAVIGATION │
└-----------------┘

カスタマイズ CUSTOMIZE デフォルトパターンから選択
SELECT A DEFAULT PATTERN

The default pattern menu
contains a recommended deck for
most of the characters. None of
them are particularly great,
however, as they only use level
1 cards. You'd best choose to
customize your own.

The customize screen is laid out
like so:
 - cards currently in your
   chosen deck on the left
 - cards remaining in reserves
   on the right
 - a filter at the top that
   narrows the reserve selection
   by category/color
 - a filter at the bottom that
   narrows the reserve selection
   by level
 - a switch in the middle that
   swaps the selected cards on
   the left and right

Press B to go back one screen at
a time. Press Y to exit from any
screen.

┌---------------┐
│ DECK STRATEGY │
└---------------┘
Remember that each deck consists
of 15 cards, but only a random
10 of those are dealt to you for
each fight, and only a random 2
of those are available to you at
any one time. When building
decks, try to stick with only 2
or 3 different types of reifu
and build strategies around
them, rather than rely on
complicated strategies involving
multiple types of cards that
aren't very likely to appear in
the right order (or at all, for
that matter).

I have included below some basic
strategy for using and dealing
with what I have found to be the
most commonly used cards in Wi-
Fi matches. There are many more
cards that can be useful, and
different characters benefit
from different deck strategies,
but you'd do well to get
accustomed to dealing with the 5
listed below.

SOUL UP (魂魄 ＵＰ) Your standard
healing card, gradually refills
your life gauge for 2/3/4/5
seconds depending on the card
level. You can't really go wrong
with this one unless you're
either forced to use it when you
already have full health or your
opponent uses a Soul Balance
card after you heal.

FORCE REIFU USE (霊符 強制使用)
Probably the best all-around
deck-breaker card. This forces
the target to use up all of his
cards as quickly as possible,
which can really mess up some
deck strategies.

It should be noted, however,
that Force Reifu can be blocked.
The effect only forces the
target to use up cards in
situations where it is already
possible to use them. In other
words, if the target is guarding
or in the middle of an attack
while the Force Reifu effect is
active, he will not use up any
cards. If he is in "Bankai Mode"
--a situation in which most
characters are not allowed to
use any cards normally--he will
also not use up any cards. If
the target already currently
using 2 cards, he will not use
up any additional cards until
one of the 2 active ones is
replaced. If you are hit with a
Force Reifu card, keep this
information in mind.

The best time to use a Force
Reifu card, in my experience, is
when the opponent has 2 or 3
reiatsu stock saved up in
reserves. That way, when you
strike him, he'll automatically
Damage Cancel out of your attack
and waste both 1 reifu and 1
reiatsu stock in the process. If
you see him use an Infinite
Reiatsu card while under the
effect of a Force Reifu, FOLLOW
UP WITH AN ATTACK IMMEDIATELY if
you are close enough (a stun
move, or an attack with a long
set-up and execution, are the
most ideal). Try not to let him
negate the effect by going into
a Bankai super.

PROHIBIT GUARD (ガード 禁止) Usually
used in conjunction with an
Infinite Reiatsu card and
prevents the target from
blocking any attacks for a set
amount of time. It's really hard
to deal with in some situations,
and it's best to run away from
the fight if it looks like
you're going to be overpowered.
If you're hit with this but can
strike the opponent quickly, try
to get him caught up in a long
combo and wait out the clock
until you can guard again. If
you have a full reiryoku bar,
try switching planes and playing
keep-away.

INFINITE REIATSU (霊圧 無尽蔵) Grants
the user a limitless number of
reiatsu stock for a very short
time (.5/1/2/4 seconds depending
on card level). Once the card
expires, the user's reiatsu
stock is always reset to 0.

This card is typically used for
an on-demand bankai super. If
you see your opponent use this,
try to stall him long enough for
the effect to pass by if
possible. Some throws last long
enough for the level 1-3
versions of this card to expire
before your opponent has a
chance to respond with a super.
If you're using this card and
your opponent tries to stall
you, Damage Cancel him if
possible (since you won't use up
any reiatsu stock by doing so).

This card is often used in
conjunction with a Guard
Prohibit, which makes quite a
deadly combination. I don't find
it to be particularly useful by
itself, however. Since the
effect only lasts a few seconds
at most before drying up, you
usually only have the
opportunity to use a single
3-stock super before the card
expires, and if your opponent
sees you use this card, he'll
know that you're planning to
rush him with a super pretty
soon. I prefer using Reiatsu Up
cards instead, as the effect is
permanent and allows you to take
your time and decide when
exactly you wish to use a super.

SOUL BALANCE (魂魄 平均化) This card
redistributes all players' life
bars so that everyone has the
exact same amount of health. The
card's effect is immediate, and
it is immediately replaced with
another reifu after using it.
Very useful, but there's a huge
drawback: if an opposing player
uses a Force Reifu card while
you have a Soul Balance card
available, you'll be forced into
using it. Moreover, since the
Soul Balance card is immediately
replaced, you'll also be forced
into Immediately using that card
as well, which can be quite
punishing. I typically stick to
Soul Up rather than Soul Balance
since the former doesn't really
have any negative effects.

At the moment, my main decks are
as follows:

SLOT A: Soul Up x10, Force Reifu
Use x5 SLOT B: Infinite Reiatsu
x8, Prohibit Guard x7 SLOT C:
Soul Up x10, Reiatsu Up x5 SLOT
D: Soul Up x10, Force Reifu Use
x1, Soul Balance x4 SLOT E: I
change this one around a lot for
training and experimenting.

Level 2 cards cost 10x as much
as level 1 cards, and level 3
cards cost 10x as much as level
2 cards. Once you purchase every
single level 1-3 card from the
shop, the level 4 cards that you
have yet to earn will become
available for purchase. They
cost quite a lot, at 200000
each.

Keep this in mind when
collecting cards for use in your
deck, as a level 3 or 4 version
of some cards are not
significantly better than their
corresponding level 1 versions
and, thus, a pretty big waste of
money. For example, the Infinite
Reiatsu card has a duration of
0.5 seconds at level 1 and 4
seconds at level 4. Most bankai
supers last longer than 4
seconds anyway, so there is no
use in spending a ton of money
on the higher level version
unless you really want a lot of
duplicates (which may or may not
be a bad idea depending on your
deck strategy).

Passwords can be entered to
unlock a handful of level 4
cards. Five of these passwords
are entered with button
combinations obtained from the
Bleach GC game, and three
passwords are entered by drawing
kanji on the touch screen.
Though I know the kanji used for
the touch screen passwords, I
unfortunately cannot determine
the exact manner in which you
are supposed to draw them. A
Japanese magazine ("V JUMP
BOOKS," I believe) supposedly
contains pictures for the touch
screen passwords, which you are
supposed to cut out, place over
the touch screen, and trace with
the stylus. If anyone can
provide scans of these cut-outs
or more information regarding
them, please feel free to
contact me.
